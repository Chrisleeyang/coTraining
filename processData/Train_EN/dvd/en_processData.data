Insert pun with word "con" here...+N+"Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it+dvd
Lies!+N+It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie+dvd
watching paint dry+N+I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.+dvd
Explosions & Animal Crackers+N+If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers.   This is a film that Ben Affleck & Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of.  Pure "leave your brain at the door" entertainment. +dvd
A good soundtrack in search of a movie.+N+About the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music. The producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick, incestuous, and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in. If you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood, don't watch this+dvd
Appalling Excess+N+I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:  First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..."  Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.     I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...   A kid chasing a ticket through a train,   A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,   A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,  (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)  OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...  A train sliding out of control on the ice,  A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,  A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.   Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...  A train car running out of control through Santa's village,  Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...  Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.  At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!    And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.  So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.  I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.        +dvd
GLAD I READ THE REVIEWS FIRST!+N+The reviewer who called this a Disney "bait & switch" hit the nail right on the head! I, too, remember seeing all these episodes on TV as a kid, then later on Disney Channel, and was awaiting these to be released on DVD, as I have already purchased the Davy Crockett and Tomorrowland sets and loved them both; but imagine my overt disappointment when I read the actual details of this slapped together, third rate offering! I never cared for the Elfego Baca story, I had been known to go to my room and VOLUNTARILY do my homework on Sunday nights when these episodes played, but I would have GLADLY paid the price for this set if it had included ALL of the "Swamp Fox" episodes! Above and beyond the fact that I am proud to have Francis Marion as a distant relative, and that I hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the Revolutionary War, who, with his compatriots, probably contributed as much as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or any of the other Founding Fathers to win us our freedom, I really loved this story just for itself! Not only have I decided NOT to waste my money on this incomplete set, I have even gone as far as removing it from my "Wish List" to save the funds of my family and friends, as well! I shall wait to see, hopefully, if Disney will ever release the entire "Swamp Fox" story in a complete set, for which I would GLADLY pay their somewhat exorbitant price+dvd
Angie Harmon deserves better roles....+N+If you have read Harmon's acting resume online, then you know she has talent, she has the training, and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along.  But being a mild conservative (Angie is a Republican) in Liberal Hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at.  Good Advice was Bad advice for her.  It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie.  It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves better roles then this.  This movie was made by Artiscan Films, which recently went into bankruptcy and is now Lions Gate Films, their films are still bad no matter the name change, and I still wait to see a better movie come to Angie Harmon+dvd
Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?+N+OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics+dvd
Worst+N+This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love the first one but this one is just lame+dvd
Save your money+N+No a very good video.  Poor quality.  Hard to follow.  Very much a cheat copy of the movie Gettysburg. +dvd
No "Socermania" instead too many repeats+N+I was hoping that "Socermania" would be on the "Extreme Sports Fun" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the "Disney Treasures" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures "Disney Rarities" and "The Chronological Donald volume 2"(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration+dvd
a crappy movie from a crappy time+N+GA. how can anyone stand this drivel? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly. worse than watching "walk tall" 8 times in a row. worse even than watching the home shopping network. eww. EWW+dvd
Watch the Original+N+An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman+dvd
Day of the Suck+N+Francisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.  The review on the back of the dvd says "jaw dropping, " but the full quote probably reads "jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant "evil side of human nature" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said "yeah, it needs some CONFLICT". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of "social commentary," but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags.   All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron.  +dvd
I turned it off half way through.+N+Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films+dvd
Femme Fatales or Very Lame?+N+Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid+dvd
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...+N+this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.     +dvd
Piracy+N+When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders.+dvd
Comedy Central, listen up+N+Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.  The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.   The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has "deleted scenes," which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.   So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.  So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.+dvd
Am I looking for something not there?+N+As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.  Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).  Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see+dvd
I worked on this dull "erotic vampire" film -- some "inside scoops"!+N+Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' "exploitation" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.  Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.   Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to "grow" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.  Mission accomplished.  Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.  Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.  Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.  The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a "meandering, almost formless script."  Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the "story."  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.  All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the "tragic" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.  However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.  How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)  I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an "inside story" on the making of this film:  We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.  Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a "class assignment."  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.  There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).  NEVER PAY for the "chance" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.  Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.  And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was "originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries," but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.  Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.  But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see.+dvd
I've seen enough+N+I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium+dvd
CLOONEY WOULD MAKE A GREAT "CORKY"+N+George Clooney is about as entertaining to watch as Michael Jackson being raped by the Gorton's fisherman. His pompous, self indulgent personality is better suited for being a Walmart greeter. Except he'd probably be fired for only saying hello to himself. Clooney: GET LOS+dvd
I really wish I did not see this movie. +N+After I saw the first two "Scary Movies" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes. I could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache! I myself, a teen, which this movie appealed too did not find this funny. I don't know why teens like this movie so much.  -Ben Russell+dvd
Remix should be sold as such.+N+Solar Flow is a fine dvd, but should not be marketed as something separate from Yoga Shakti.  There are no new sequences, just remixes of the Shakti sequences.  Since you can rearrange all the Shakti sequences on your own, Solar Flow is superfluous.  I don't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice.  A little disclosure please! -Rebecc+dvd
But The Movie Only Has One+N+Even though I am not a Streisand fan, I was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was.  The plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible - to the main male character.  The problem is, she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover!  Somebody (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are disgusting. BAAAAAAMP!  (That's the fallacy alarm going off:  men, in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.)  There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference! Yet truly, the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand, discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, "Wazz I a pretty baby?  WAZZ I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?"  In that one scene, Streisand's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed.  The whole movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast, crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s emotional issues like that. I really think that the "Funny Girl" phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes.  The media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think Ingrid Bergman.....).  I recall reading about how her glowing complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy and voice) carried her through despite her looks:  long nose, large lips, slanted eyes.  Myself, I think she looks like an Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like Grace Kelly..... So why can't she accept this?  The majority of us women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do!  This movie is not about that.  This movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable.   Maybe I should've given it only one star+dvd
Starts Out Strong, But Fizzles Quickly...+N+Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language+dvd
Rappers, Stop Acting!+N+I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie+dvd
Shockingly Revisionist and Doctrinaire View of Jazz History+N+Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there+dvd
Decent, but the weakest "Scary Movie"+N+While "Scary Movie 4" does work in getting out a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past three.  Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly, are getting pretty old.  Although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge.  The writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier.  And really, was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films?  I believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience, and is vastly different from what Scary Movies 1 & 2 offered (which I found to be extremely hilarious).  If you're looking for over the top funny, look towards the other Scary Movies+dvd
Clarification of previous review+N+Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD  transfer, I was only referring to the &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; DVD.  The Father Goose DVD is not that bad+dvd
"What does it mean? It makes no sense."+N+Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she says, "What does it mean? It makes no sense."   Although there is still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of "Beauty and the Beast." The very title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya "must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people." Nor is it true that "the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his redemption." Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding words: "Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, damnation and salvation." BTW, the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE her hand that's gripping the bow.   With one exception, the acting is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that only this role has "teeth"; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only his role required a "special effect" (his morphing back to Agnar, which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the film, knew was coming).   Other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable "ships." Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or 21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control of its locking device. How convenient.   The costumes are also anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top.   Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu, two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics; Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen, stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo, seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer.   Oh, one more thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views from hiding, far-far-far away+dvd
Skip this one, get the original!+N+Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself+dvd
Misleading search results+N+I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!+dvd
Pure genius!!+N+Git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as Larry the cable guy. Larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head, but end up doubling you over with laughter. His preformance will definitely torque your brain, so be prepared. There are a couple instances where Larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure. One such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun. I was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that Larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don't fart, they don't even have buttholes. He then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out EVER. Unless you are an idiot, you know you can't look like him without a strict training regiment, nice try Larry. He finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-Hillary Clinton piece. This was the icing on the cake for me because when I think of intelligent political commentary, I think Larry the cable guy!!!!+dvd
Supernova in the classroom+N+Does anyone know if there is a real PG-13 version of this film?  I've been told it came out as a PG-13 and then was changed to an R film.  Pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see..+dvd
Don't Bother Buying this DVD+N+I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.+dvd
Ridiculous and lame!+N+"Cursed" is the most pathetic werewolf movie I've seen since "An American Werewolf in Paris".  The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling.  The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience.  This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is "cool", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for "Cursed".  Well, at least it's not as bad as "An American Werewolf in Paris", but that sure as hell isn't saying much. +dvd
Interesting Archival Footage Grafted onto Bad History+N+This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.  I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.  This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.  First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.  Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, "having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return."  And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.  I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel+dvd
great cast no logic+N+We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great+dvd
hated it !!!+N+i have been waiting to see this film for a while now. and i just finally saw it i'm very dissapointed. this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills. the film sucks!!! the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat. and get stranded on a deserted isolated island. was a great! idea except that with this film you're going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me. i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi's make up looks silly. they're not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh. the picture quality has aged even if it's dvd format very grainy poor picture quality. i have seen other movies from the 1970's on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it's age. but this was awful. the only good thing it has was decent acting lol. like i said before this is nothing but a (low budget cheap horror film) rent it if you like. but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time.  +dvd
Nearly 15 yrs later, still the worst movie I've seen+N+Agree that it was beautifully filmed, but.... there must have been a great deal lost in the translation+dvd
stupid movie trying so hard to be cool+N+watched like reading a comic book. so many murders for so little money. corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature. lousy acting, directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility. a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch. boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario? give me a break+dvd
Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining+N+Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so+dvd
A Dolled-up Abridgement of the Book+N+I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup.  Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed+dvd
Please don't waste your money....+N+Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..+dvd
A Near Perfect Movie+P+In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope.  The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs.  The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks.  Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons.   If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing.+dvd

Now, this is what I like!+P+I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.  The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.  I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.  And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy+dvd
We love Brainy Baby at our house. +P+I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.    And the toys.......he LOVES them.  "Hello, Brainy Baby!"  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.    We love Brainy Baby at our house. +dvd
A musical vision fulfilled - Townes Van Zandt and friends+P+I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's "LA Freeway." I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect.  The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.    This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little.  I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me.  When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a "medley of my hit" and sings "Pancho and Lefty," and Rodney Crowell sang "Bluebird Wine," both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's "Alabama Highways" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best.+dvd
A Man For His Times.+P+I have owned a copy of this film for a long time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous "Twinkie Defense", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on.+dvd
Antwone Fisher  (2002)+P+Director:  Denzel Washington Cast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson. Running Time:  120 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse.  Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, "Antwone Fisher" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change.   Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - "I don't know what to do" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera.   This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, "Antwone Fisher" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors.+dvd
I am Queen of Egypt+P+The best Cleopatra that the movies has ever produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part. So many came before and so many after Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth Taylor. A mega movie, with fantastic costumes, and acting, is a classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection+dvd
Loved it as a kid and I still do................+P+Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.+dvd
Suprisingly good, much better than I thought+P+WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.  Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.  I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention.   The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.  Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful.  -Mark (for the record 32yrs old, straight and yes I enjoyed this movie) +dvd
if you like hard hitting stuff...+P+What is it with the British film scene and its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the likes of Ray Winstone in it?  Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one, but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces. I personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass, dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate.  But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him.   We learn that no matter what environment children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow.   Without wishing to give too much away, it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things+dvd
Great instruction, great program, great FUN+P+This program is simply the best kid's program I've ever seen. I really can't say a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, I just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is. - A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with. This is terrific program+dvd
BUT for the children...+P+Great movie. It is a  must to have in your dvd collection. Some scenes in the movie are hillarious. you laugh until you have tears in your eyes. an interesting comparison of the American and European culture. the twist at the end incredible. Do not miss this movie.+dvd
Still a lot of laughs in this old thing...+P+Jane Fonda is best taken on screen in small doses, and the presence of the ace funny girl Lily Tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside, good-girl inside Dolly Parton in supporting roles help this project immensely. My favorite actor in this one, however, is Dabney Coleman as the evil boss. There are a few excesses, including a marijuana scene which rings false  for this trio of co-workers, but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours.+dvd
if this is "great," no wonder the french are exterminating themselves+N+The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by.+dvd
DENZEL+P+NEED I SAY MORE---GOOD LIKE EVERYMOVIE HE ACTS IN--GOOD STORY LINE WITH A TWIST..+dvd
As great a tour as the two albums it was promoting.+P+The 90's Quadrilogy of Achtung Baby,Zooropa,The Passengers(released under that psuedonym)and Pop are the last daring albums of U2's career. This concert footage parodies not only U2's celebrity, but celebrity in general. With banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage, the band was mocking it's own ubiquity. Sadly, they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour+dvd
More "Lost Cause" Mythology+N+It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the "War between the States" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey+dvd
A simple and cute kids movie+P+My four year old loved this movie. The plot was very simple and easy to follow, nothing too complicated for her. The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children+dvd
A highly original Western comedy...+P+A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy...  When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails).  Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford.  As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge...  Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try...  The DVD Repor+dvd
And who could that be stalking us now?+N+Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.  I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort  normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.      Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality.   +dvd
Don't waste your money!+N+I bought this DVD thinking I could get what my Pilates class gives me right at home.  Boy was I wrong.  This is a horrible example of Pilates.  The sessions just goes through the motions.  They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level.  The transitions are way too fast.  Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money! +dvd
Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light.+P+I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory "How it was made" or "Behind the Scenes" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film. This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story.  This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a "Hit" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing. A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong+dvd
great if you dig hallmark cards+N+i loved "my so-called life" and was expecting something good here, based on all these reviews. but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these DVDs were a bad omen. still, i hung in and hoped for the best. i was sitting there watching and really wondering "do people really relate to this stuff?" the characters on this show look like they're from JC penney catalogs, or ivory soap commercials. white bread, sanitary, vapid... thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people. this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him. the kids on this show are cute, but all kids are cute. nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing. i am SOOOOO glad that the world is nothing like how it's portrayed on this show. NEVER AGAIN!!+dvd
An 80's Classic+P+I love this movie!! I remember the first time I saw it, I was about 6-7 yrs.old, on a plane & on my way to Puerto Rico.  Eighteen (or so) years later, I bought it & watched it with my family, it brought back so many great memories, We loved it all over again. I love the music, the dancing & the actors/actresses, The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because IT IS AN 80's MOVIE!  We all know how 80's dance movies  have the bad fame of neing CORNY!  I have to admit, it did have some corny and bad acting moments, but all in all, I think this is an amewome movie, I love it & recommend it+dvd
A minus B movie. +N+This movie really didn't show me anything exciting in Salsa dance...the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers Willie Colon and Celia Cruz.+dvd
Wonderful Memories+P+It as wonderful to enjoy Season 1 of Hart to Hart all over again. The black tie, the romance -- it was great!+dvd
Mugen's the name pal, you got that?+P+WOW! that's one word that comes to mind. WOW! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air, their has not been any anime shows that have interested me. for years i searched, never finding anything worth watching. then, i sort of gave up. i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail. then one night it happened: i saw the second episode of Samurai Champloo air on adult swim. at first, i wasnt paying attention to the words and action. i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels: THE ANIMATION! the artwork was incredible!the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real. it was almost as if it was a sitcom, with real people. only tis was completly animated. it was eye-popping!then, i started to watch the show itself and the show was great!!! anyway, since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes. but alas, the last one (number seven) comes out this month on the 17th. the show is coming to an end. so anyway, im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them. i rated volume one of samurai champloo below:  episode one: tempestuous temperaments- jin, mugen and fuu meet for the first time. mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three "bad asses" and sends some cowards to go get them. mugen however, does not know that jin has killed them already. mugen mistakes jin as one of the "bad asses" and attatcks him. a brilliant fight insues, and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together.  i rate episode one a 10/10  episode two: redeye reprisal-  mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one. in this episode, the man is out for revenge. the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen. also, jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him. another great fight. and last of all, our modest (cough) fuu gets smashed. i rate this episode 9/10  episodes 3 & 4: hellhounds for hire part one and two- the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together. jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd. mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang. fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house. i give both episodes 3&4 10/10  thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo. if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes. i will say this, they are really expensive. but they are worth the money. i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it. if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not, i reccomend you buy it. i can personally vouch for this dvd. of course, its always good to check other reviews by different people as well.  later. i hope this review helped+dvd
Worst movie I've ever seen+N+I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films+dvd
0 STARS: These movies are worse than the original.+N+These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies.  From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive".  The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too!  What a worthless...waste+dvd
Pretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort+N+Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.+dvd

The Star Wars Trilogy... NOT+N+These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger+dvd
Not  for babies+N+Sorry, but I have to give this DVD a negative review. First of all: what age is it really for?  There are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition. Don't you think it's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old (and probably even 3)?  The DVD needs much more real life objects, it sounds and looks VERY dull and boring. I always thought  that children learn through play, songs, rhymes, and etc, but  not through dull repetition. Even alphabet is introduced without well known "ABC song".  I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend: Hap Palmer "Baby songs: ABC,123, colors & shapes"; Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder; Baby Babble - speech enhancing video; Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors); The Wiggles-"Toot-Toot"+dvd
A brief comment+P+I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment.+dvd
McNamara's Not-Quite Confession... and for good reason  +P+My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse.  While "The Thin Blue Line" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' "Fog of War" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span.  World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the "larger footprint" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record.  In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy.  The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act:  The President of the United States.  Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition.  Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions).  McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man.     With that "public pitfall" in mind, McNamara's explanations and answers to Morris' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous, but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework.  At one point in the film, Morris' essentially asks McNamara who was responsible for Vietnam decisions and McNamara quickly replies, "The President".  The audience (or at least, I) wanted McNamara to answer, "It was my decision" and - as such - may view the President Response as a cop-out.  However, McNamara is absolutely correct; the decision for action rested with the Commander-in-Chief and his name was never Robert Strange McNamara.  From the audience's perspective, it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting (i.e., not damning) the two presidents he served and loved.   Personally, I relished the personal insights Morris captured (or that McNamara permitted himself to show?).  These poignant glimpses ranged from McNamara's tearful story of surveying Arlington National Cemetery for Kennedy's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the McNamara Family during the Secretary of Defense years.  My favorite insight into McNamara's soul comes during the retelling of the young Quaker who set himself on fire below McNamara's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander.  While the story is well known, McNamara pays respect to the widow's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter.  I am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others, but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film.   In terms of filmmaking, some reviews have blasted Morris' technique of being off camera and unmiked, his use of the Glass soundtrack, or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes, bombing, or protests.  In many respects, they are right:  either you love Morris' methods or they will grate on you.  The editing cuts can be choppy, but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material.  If you enjoy a bombastic Michael Moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric, then "The Fog of War" may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental.  On the other hand, if you enjoyed Morris' earlier "The Thin Blue Line" or Barbara Kopple's "Harlan County, USA" and "American Dream", then you will want to buy this DVD for the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and McNamara's own rules.+dvd
Madea's Family Reunion+P+Anything Madea is in is worth watching! This movie had it all.   I loved it+dvd
Finally on DVD! Yay!+P+True, this isn't a series for parents looking for advice (as one of the previous reviewers critiqued), but this is MY FAVORITE baby show and I am very glad that I can ditch my tapes now that it is out on DVD.  There are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single DVD-- let's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all! The episodes present classic psyc. experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating.  If you are taking an intro. to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep, get this DVD!  Actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the set-ups will help you remember the different cognitive stages.  They are just too cute! and it is neat to see what "tricks" you can play on your own little fellow+dvd
Profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film.+N+Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see.+dvd

The 70's are back!+P+It's nice to see that what was effective for me as "hip" edu-tainment is every bit as effective now as "retro." However the appeal, the cast delivers solid lessons disguised as campy sketch comedy a la "Amanda" or "All That.+dvd
Amazing+P+My child is 1y & 6m, I found [Baby Babble] is perfect for him, as the movie start, he start watching and trying to repeat after, but sometimes he won't be in a mood to watch, so I have to think about the perfect time for him each day which I found that it vary from day to day+dvd
Sorry, Spy Hard is a waste of time+N+I love Leslie Nielsen, but this movie is not funny. His better movies are Wrongfully Accused and the Naked Gun movies+dvd
Oh no...it finally happened. Leslie Nielsen in a bad parody!+N+I am a big Leslie Nielsen fan. I first saw him in the Naked Gun series, which I thought was awesome, then I saw him again in Wrongfully Accused. I was so enthralled that I acquired Airplane, which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it.  I had thought he could do no wrong, but he really disappointed me here. What is wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING you will see in here are things you have already seen in other Leslie Nielsen comedy movies. There are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it's painful rather than funny. For example, the x-ray glasses. My God, when that was mentioned, I just felt nauseous.  The problem with this movie is that it continues the Naked Gun-variety humor, but it does it rather badly. Most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring. Aside from that, this movie lacks a proper plot. All throughout the movie, it doesn't seem like Dick Steele (Nielsen) did anything, but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag. Nielsen's other movies had bad plots too, but at least they were coherent.  I am sorry (mostly to myself for seeing this), but this was just a bad movie. Perhaps the director should go watch the entire Naked Gun series to see how it is done+dvd
A True Classic+P+I remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people. All of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth: CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. I think it's easy to see why this is the case. The story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore, but the story of young Harvey Cheyne coming of age aboard a Gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance, people can change.  On of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. Depression era child star Freddie Bartholomew plays the incorrigible Harvey. Bartholomew plays the role with great skill. He's miserable enough that we're glad when he finally falls overboard, yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued. The transformation is believable and by the films end, we begin to believe in Harvey and even grow to like him. Spencer Tracy won an Oscar as Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure Harvey has ever known. Today Tracy would never get away with playing a Portuguese fisherman with his Irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent, yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed. Lionel Barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt New England sea captain Disko Troop. Mickey Rooney is somewhat underused as the captain's son Dan. My guess is that if the film were made a few years later when Rooney became a matinee idol, he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded.  While a great cast carries the film, there are also smaller details that make the film powerful. The original sea shanties add a certain flavor. The special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time, and the sailing scenes are stupendous. This was no small feat in the 1930's. The film certainly is a timeless classic. People who purchase this DVD will also love the bonus features; trailers of the 1946 re-release, a short film THE LITTLE MAESTRO and a cartoon LITTLE BICK CHEESER. +dvd
Quack,Quack!+N+"The Hospital" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character.  The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller.  The medical profession can be lampooned but don't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film+dvd
A most delighful movie for Everyone+P+I possibly watched hundreds of movies, and this one is surely one of the most delighful movies I have ever seen. I watched it with my dog Sultan, and he loved it as much as I did. The story is interesting and amuzing, the characters simply adorable. It touches your Heart, pleases your senses, and relaxes your mind. Could you ask for more? I would recommend this movie to everyone of all ages. You could see it again and again and it won't tire on you because there is Real Joy at its core. It aims to share this Joy with you, and it couldn't do a better job. Bravo!!+dvd
So disappointed, so very disappointed+N+I laughed like a loon when I watched these shows as a kid.  My sides hurt and tears came to my eyes. For years, I told people that that this was the best, most creative, funniest show ever aired. I tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but I never did. Suddenly, I found this collection on Amazon and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch.  I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed.  Nary a laugh or even a snicker on the DVD. Truly disappoined after decades of waiting. Sigh!   +dvd
A question for fellow reviewers...+P+Okay, I haven't actually purchased the fifth season of "All In the Family", but what I need to know before I do is how many episodes does it contain? Is it the standard 24? This info would really help. Thanks+dvd
So Many Great Songs!+P+I saw "Annie Get Your Gun" again this weekend live on stage.  I had forgotten just how many great songs Irving Berlin wrote for this masterpiece! --"You Can't Get A Man With A Gun", "The Girl That I Marry",  "Doin' What Comes Naturally," "Anything You Can Do I can do better," "They Say falling in love is Wonderful," "I Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night," and the classic anthem "There's No Business Like Show Business."If you haven't seen or heard this musical, please do yourself a favor and get this film on tape or DVD.  Afterthoughts:  I just read several negative reviews about Betty Hutton's portrayal of Annie Oakley.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.  DO NOT EVEN READ THEM!  Some people are "the glass is half empty" type of people and negativity is contagious!  Betty Hutton's portrayal was, of course,  probably directed by the director of the film.    So it is "the director's portrayal"; the director is responsible for what Betty Hutton did on screen.  And, this is not meant to be a "realistic" portrayal of a "real" person anyway---no one alive remembers what Annie Oakley was really like.  So the portrayal by Betty Hutton (as directed by her director) is as good a "shot at it" as any other---including Judy Garland's portrayal.  So,  I suggest you just accept Betty Huttons portrayal as "one among many possible" and enjoy what the portrayal does have---alot of comedic verve and vivacity!  Yes, "the glass is half full"..and even more than half.... in this case.    And then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because Annie pretends to be a poorer shot than Frank  near the end to "get her man" by letting him win and thus showing  his "shooting prowess" some respect to make him feel better. I suppose for some people it is "politically incorrect" to "play the male ego game".  But, isn't "playing the male ego game"  what it takes sometimes to "get the man you want?"  So, wasn't Annie in the play just being "realistic"?  Isn't criticizing this aspect of the play "nit-picking".  Ask yourself, could you even come close to writing  a   "masterpiece"  like the musical, "Annie Get Your Gun"?  If you couldn't do it, then what gives you the right to  "nit pic" the show?  And the Indian issue.   Some people feel Indians were disrespected in the show.  But, the show I saw has Chief Sitting Bull portrayed as giving good advice to Annie and being an intelligent person. In my opinion,  whichever way the Indians were portrayed in the movie doesn't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show.   My suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and ENJOY THE SHOW!  And there's alot to enjoy!  :o)   Email  Boland7214@aol.c+dvd
Not for weight loss+N+This DVD is fine for beginners who would like some stretching, but there is no weight loss aspect to it. I felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight+dvd
Good visuals, very confusing story+N+I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused.  The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through+dvd
3 times through+P+After watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects (geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line) or that it is a complete mess. I admit that I enjoyed what I thought was mindless entertainment, but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what I thought was a Hollywoodish Anime (not a good thing). However I was fortunate to see one OVA  at a time, therefore I watched the first OVA about three times, the second two times and at last all three together (these three are what make up the contents of this DVD). So by the time I finished this first half of the story I pretty much understood it. This DVD entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story.  Honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in. It appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once; however I believe that is what he intends. As the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine (OVA to OVA). So expect the first OVA to be the most complicated and confusing. but if you Read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it.  Finally, the animation and CG is second to none. It is an extremely beautiful anime.  Sooo, I highly recommend reading the summery on the back of the box first+dvd
A horror film that stands the test of time!+P+Simply put, most horror films don't age well at all. When I use the term "horror" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which "the changeling" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time.  The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of "the sixth sense". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered "graphic" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film. If you're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence.... the changeling is a good choice!  Not a perfect film, but an excellent effort that holds up well.  -J+dvd
Keep a notebook next to you when you watch this DVD!!!+P+Powerful, fast moving, comprehensive, well researched, resourceful, well filmed, comfortable to the eye, I could go on and on describing this brilliant work by PBS. This feature is like a tour to various artists' studios and exhibitions without leaving your chair. I loved it so much I ordered the 1st & 2nd seasons, which come together by the way on one DVD.  They should add this tagline to the DVD box: "Inspiration GUARANTEED!" What are you waiting for? Click 'Add to Shopping Cart' right now+dvd
CLASSIC MUSICAL!!+P+Lil'Abner is a fantastic musical which is pleasing to both children, as well as adults! The movie plays like a comic strip/cartoon and is a must see for all fans of obscure family oriented musicals!  Although I have never read any of the classic comic strips..the movie is still very cute! Movies like this are not made anymore! Highly recommended!!+dvd
Bette and Woody?+N+Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two+dvd
Terrific Farce+P+Reminds me of Richard Bissell's novel "Say, Darling," a witty send-up of the process of launching a Broadway musical suspiciously resembling "The Pajama Game."       Woody Allen's vision here takes on an interface of commercial theatre, Runyonesque gangsters (though closer to the Sopranos than "Guys And Dolls")and Greenwich Village intellectuals (Think about Dave Van Ronk reminiscing about the San Remo in Scorsese's "No Direction Home" or the lighter side of "Reds."). The John Cusack character is how Barton Fink might have turned out if he hadn't gone to Hollywood.+dvd
good buy+P+I love a good dance movie and this is one for the collection.  This dvd sells for about $7.00 at thiat price it is a very good buy+dvd
AWESOME!!!+P+I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging+dvd
Fock You!+N+This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently+dvd
As far as funny movies go...+P+While I think I much preferred the first movie to this one, I found this one to be pretty amusing. There were a few good moments where I found myself giggling, and then there were moments when I could totally relate to the feeling of never being good enough for the in-laws no matter what you do. Some of the sexual innuendo was hilarious. The stuff with the kid was just stupid, but it was so stupid that it was funny. All in all, worth the time to watch if you are in the mood for comedy. It's dumb, but in a good way+dvd
Ghetto Monkey, Modification Morons with Mufflers+N+I would rate this piece of film trash a "0", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides "dawg" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity+dvd
Just Say No+N+This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless.+dvd
Unique and Entertaining,+P+The first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation. It's hard to even describe really... But expect some disoriented backgrounds with some CGI thrown in. The plot however, is excellent. The main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories. He constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers. They do what is called "committing" someone for their sins. These first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great. This anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there+dvd
screw u guys im going home hilarious+P+i think south parkis like the best show in the world so is family guy but u cant beat s park with anything. 1 sad thing is that kenny does not die in seasons after 5 and in 6 my favorite character kenny what sadly only in the last episode of the season i own seasons 1-8 i know 8 didnt come out yet but at a place called cd island they have dvds before they come out. i think that the best episode of this show ever was on season 9 and the episode was about the kids playing baseball but they really haTED IT and they kept winning episode was hilarious. i think anybody who likes south park must get season 8 you must .also the episode when the boys play with weapons is also a favorite so if you like south park comedy buy season 8  P.S. if youreally like south park buy seasons 1-7 witch r also hilarous+dvd

one of the worsts!+N+the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie+dvd
Poor value even though I love TamiLee+N+This item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me.  I love TamiLee and her Arms and Abs video from a few years ago.  That's why I was excited to see what I thought was a newer production of Arms and Abs workouts.  The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts.  The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good.  I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were.  Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1!  Because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than DVDs since you don't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this DVD is just a back-up for the tape I already use+dvd
Disappointing+N+It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable+dvd
Powerful Performances+P+What stands out most in Mike Nichols' production of Angels in America in the performaces. Al Pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way. No one else really talked about Belize played by Jeffrey Wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill (not to mention his amusing depiction of Mr. Lies). Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending. Each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play. But the fully realized characters are what you should come to see+dvd
It's Just a Title+P+Reading these reviews, I was surprised by a number of the comments but most of all by those that rented/bought this movie believing it was somehow about "angels" and then had the nerve to complain that they didn't know what it was about or that there were no angels in the movie.  With that in mind, I'd like to offer some advice to those that may inadvertently rent/buy other movies:  There are no Cuckoo birds and no nests in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There is no obvious wind in Gone With the Wind and what there was didn't blow anything away There are few, if any, good fellas in Goodfellas There are no lambs in Silence of the Lambs Chinatown isn't set in a town in China There is neither $1,000,000 nor a baby in Million Dollar Baby You guessed it, no bulls in Raging Bull The coats are made of denim or some such material in Full Metal Jacket Paul Newman's body temperature is about 98.6 degrees just like the rest of us in Cool Hand Luke There is little, if any, sleeping in The Big Sleep The prison hallway is only a few feet long in The Green Mile The African Queen is not about a gay black man No waterfowl were hurt in the making of Duck Soup The earth rotated as usual on the Day the Earth Stood Still There are actually multiple conversations in The Conversation The raunchy men's magazine does not appear in The Hustler Nobody inherited the wind in Inherit the Wind. It still belongs to all of us There is no discernible odor while watching The Sweet Smell of Success All the President's Men is only about *some* of the president's men  I hope that some will find these simple reminders useful. If not, you may want to consider looking at the back of a DVD case, visiting your local library or going to one of the thousands of web sites that talk about every movie ever made.  As for this film, if you're not frightened by things that might be different than what you've experienced or that perhaps strike too close to home, and don't spend your time judging how everyone else lives, then there is much to love about this work. It may not be perfect, and there can be many legitimate gripes about it, but overall it's very, very good. Scan through the positive reviews here and you'll get a good sense of it. No need for me to repeat it all here. Unfortunately, most (but not all) of the negative reviews are just those with some sort of political/religious agenda to put forth instead of commenting on the film+dvd
Leaves you wanting more+P+Everyone remembers the 1963 series where Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) goes running around in every episode just missing the criminal that killed his wife. He in turn is being chased by Lt. Philip Gerard (Barry Morse) who thinks Kimble did it and is a fugitive from the law. The whole thing was narrated by William Conrad.  Well now we have the movie. This time we have a beginning middle and ending all in 161 minutes.   Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife Helen (Sela Ward) are the perfect couple. Then one night while he was working for some inexplicable reason a despicable person dispatches Helen. On her way to the netherworld she inadvertently says Richard on the 911 call. One thing leads to another and Kimble gets the blame. In the process of transporting him from one containment system to another the transport meets with a little accident; now Kimble is free to find locate the real perpetrator. Now it is up to Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) to find and retrieve Kimble.  Now that we have covered the basic there is not where to begin to tell how great this movie is on many levels. The anticipation of the chase of Kimble to find the perpetrator (by the way he has only one arm) before Gerard catches him. We get close and have a few read herrings. Tommy Lee gets to keep his stoic look as he says things like "I don't care." And "I don't bargain."   Personaly I think that the Chicago police knew all along who the real bad guy was and was covering for him several times right up to the end. They went out of there way to paint Kimble as the bad guy.  Detective Rosetti (Joseph F. Kosala) also tried to stop him from revealing the real perpetrator. Rosetti referring to Kimball even after the truth is revealed "He's going down. You won't help us, you stay the hell out!"+dvd
Anne of the Green Gables+N+I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it+dvd
Very poor DVD of a wonderful movie+N+This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was very disappointed with the DVD version.  In the middle of the movie, you will have to get up, go to your DVD player, and flip the DVD over to the second side to see the rest of the movie.  I don't know what bozo came up with that idea, but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie.  Who wants to get up and flip the DVD over in the middle of the suspense?  This format takes stupidity to the next level.  I would highly recommend the VHS since I have it and it's wonderful.  I would NOT recommend the DVD until they do a better version.  The packaging is in paper and not durable at all, another truly bad idea.  DVD's should be in plastic cases, not paper+dvd
movie for morons+N+This movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First "screenwriter":" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names" Second "screenwriter" "Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas".  Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks. Basically the plot is Tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name. If that's your idea of humor, I pity you. +dvd
Pul-eese. Why did they have to make this movie?+N+I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book?   If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.  I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.  If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds.   It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even.   I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.  I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is.   I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right+dvd
Dull and boring. This 'Trick' should refund your money...+N+Like most indie gay themed movies, "Trick" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved "Die Mommy, Die!", "Girls Will Be Girls", and "Jeffrey". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??  I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality. A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb?    Uh... why??  So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy.  And then it's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans.  As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's "acting", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.  The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The "sizzling" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.  A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.  But she's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish, you'd think she was in a different movie.  High expectations, very low gratification. Honestly, skip it+dvd
Attention Grabbing+P+I throughly enjoyed this movie because of the plots twists and turns. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt both delivered excellent performances and contributed much to the intrigue of the story.  While this one might be a bit out there for the general public, I found it to be a white knuckle ride and couldn't wait to get back on. Probably not a "first date" kind of movie, but if you're wanting a story that grabs your attention and then throws it down the stairs, along the lines of Pulp Fiction, this is it+dvd
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!+P+DAS BOOT HELD MY INTREST FROM BEGINING TO END. I FELT I WAS ON THE SUBMARINE.  I USED THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES, BUT I FOUND MYSELF TURNING UP THE VOLUME TO HEAR THE GERMAN DIALOGUE. ADVENTURE, ACTION, AND SUSPENSE TRULY A GREAT MOVIE. SIX STARS TO THE DIRECTOR. +dvd
ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS WATCHING MICHAEL JACKSON DRY-HUMP HOWDY DOODY+N+I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (...+dvd
watch you talking about willis?+N+The story of the Strokes is the story of wealth and privilege, and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like Lou Reed and VU riffs.  This was made without RCA, and so lacks strokes music.    The band apparently wanted nothing to do with it, it is practically DIY, with no interviews.  This just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project.  Their 2nd album sucked anyway+dvd
MacGyver on stupid pills+N+As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action+dvd
don't be &quot;con&quot; vinced into watching this+N+To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars+dvd
An action flick with philosophical undertones+P+I just finished watching I, Robot on HBO. I can't vouch for the quality of the picture or sound of this particular DVD, just the storyline. I really enjoyed it. A lot of action, but there is (obviously) a philosophical undertone to the whole film.   Purists will probably dislike that the philosophy (and much of the original story) of Isaac Asimov's book takes a backseat to the action. During some scenes, I was thinking: wow, they definitely made a video game about this movie. Much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action, though, contrary to another viewer's opinion, I didn't find the climax "stupid." I found it complimented the philosophical aspects of the film, though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action.   Parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by Peter Singer, the radical secularist/ professor at Princeton University who advocates infanticide for disabled children. Specifically, this conversation from the film sticks in my mind:  "You are making a mistake. Do you not see the logic of my plan?" To which the reply comes: "Yes. But it just seems too...heartless." Essentially, the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process; just cold, detached logic, which sometimes sounds great on paper, but is much less appealing in the real world.  In sum, a lot of action, though the philosophical aspect is still very much present (man vs. creator, creator vs. man, the soul, purpose in life,  free will, natural law, conscience and consciousness etc) once you reflect on the film. Mostly action entertainment, but also thought provoking on further review+dvd
Great cartoons, but some are not well restored+P+We bought this installment of the "Disney Treasures" series when it was released late in 2005.  My 9 year old son and I just watched these cartoons again (Oct. 2006) and we both love them.  I would have to agree, however, with those reviewers who have noted that visually the cartoons in this Vol. 2 of the "Chronological Donald" were not restored to the same degree of perfection as those in earlier releases, including Vol. 1 of the "Chronological Donald" and the release containing many Donald World War II cartoons entitled "On the Front Lines".  There is a clear difference in quality, which is apparent when the Donald cartoons previously released in "On the Front Lines" and repeated in this collection are compared to the cartoons that are new here.  The former are visually superior, not because they were better to begin with, but because they have been more carefully restored and transferred.  This is a shame.  One hopes that in Chronological Donald Vol 3 (apparently not to be released in 2006, but perhaps in 2007) there will be a return to the quality of Vol. 1 and "On the Front Lines."  One might even hope for a new, improved Vol. 2, but that is probably not in the cards+dvd
Just one question: WHAT DID YOU PEOPLE EXPECT?+P+Come on people! What did you expect from this movie? Did you think it was going to be like the slience of the lambs? Did you think it was going to win best picture? Did you think that Micheael Douglas or his hot wife or their daughter would die? I seriously hope not. Everyone knew what was going to happen in this movie. There would be action, suspense and a very predictable ending. No, duh. Did you really think that the ending would be shocking? Did you think that the bad guys would kill anyone? Come on.  I didn't expect anything of this movie. NOTHING. And if you were like me, then you would have like it. But, on the other hand, if you were expecting a thriller like Seven or the silence of the lambs, then yeah, you'd be disspointed. But, I decided to rent this, wanting to watch a fun and interesting movie. And it was. I enjoyed the plot, enjoyed the action, enjoyed the suspense, and enjoyed the acting by Michael Douglas and Brittany Murphy. I always am up for watching excellent movies like Ghost World, Frailty, American History X, Seven, etc.. but movies like that are hard to come around. In comes movies like Don't Say A Word. They're predictable, even lame, but I still find them to be fun and amusing. Maybe if you people would lower your dam* expectations, maybe you'd enjoy movies like this. This is worth a rent if you don't expect seeing a best picture nominee. But, all the reviewers on Amazon obviously were thinking: "the next silence of the lambs! The next Seven! Weeh!!!!!!!!!!!" Yeah, like Michael Douglas would actually die or anything plot twist, crazy like Seven is going to happen in this movie. You'll like this if you lower your expectations.+dvd
"He found himself yearning to know of their affairs",+P+Directed by Saul Dibbs, this opulent adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty - his decadent coming of age novel about love, class, sex and money set in the hypocritical Thatcherite Eighties - is indeed a feast for the eye.  Beautifully acted, with a spot-on affinity for detailing time and place, The Line of Beauty replicates Hollinghurst's hedonistic themes and the moral quandaries of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens), the titular middle-class outsider in this world of privilege.  As with the book, this film adaptation begins in 1983 when the young twenty-year-old Nick Guest is asked by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to come and stay with his family in their sumptuous Notting Hill home in the Kensington Park Gardens estate. Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a sycophantic Tory Member of Parliament who is on the rise, and is basking in the glory of Thatcher's economic policies. Gerald lives with loyal wife Rachel (Alice Krigg), his daughter Catherine (Hayle Atwell), and Toby.  Nick's comes from a provincial, terribly middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - but he is welcomed into the Fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time, he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic and troubled Catherine. Nick is wined and dined, enthusiastically partaking of the family's lavish parties and political dinners, trying to impress them in their superficial discussions on literature, art and antiques.   Nick tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom, but he's unsure of his footing in this opulent, prosperous looking-glass world. In fact, Dan Stevens plays Nick with a kind of wide-eyed, eloquent fury, always nicely mannered, but forever hidden is the ever-present pretension and affectation, and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror, this troubled man finds it reluctant to give its approval.   Nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure, yet when he falls in love with Leo, (Don Gilet) a lusty black cockney and socialist council worker, he finds himself caught in a Jamesian-like dilemma, wedged between the powerful, privileged life led by the Feddens and their friends, whilst also having to face the stark realities of Eighties Britain - the vast unemployment and the rise of AIDS.   The second and third episodes of the series feature Nick's relationship with Wani (Alex Wyndham), a long-lashed Lebanese millionaire playboy. While working as a creative consultant on Wani's new magazine, Ogee - named after the curve that is Hogarth's line of beauty - Nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes, moneyed decadence, and cocaine-fueled days and nights. And of course this all culminates in the beautifully recreated coke-fuelled dance with "The Lady" herself, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (Kika Markham).  This BBC adaptation follows Hollinghurst's book pretty much to the letter, although in some instances, the film fails to catch much of the subtleness and nuance of the source material. The scenes involving Nick's sex and coke binges in the toilets and bedrooms of his grand surroundings seem hurriedly cut short, and the pivotal scene of the dreary piano recital fails to capture the tiniest social shenanigans and inherent boredom of all the guests as well as it could.   Also, when the Fedden's take Nick on their holiday to France, the pacing slows a bit, but thankfully picks up speed again in readiness for the final dï¿½nouement, the penultimate dance with The Lady. The cast is solid throughout, but Stevens is without a doubt the standout, imbuing Nick with a neediness and an obvious desire to be loved. He speaks his emotions and is in need of reassurance of his place within the Fedden household. He exists in a limbo space of not quite belonging, and in innocence of the dark undertones of the world he has entered.   Amidst the euphoria of first love, champagne and high society parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, deception, and the ultimate hypocrisy towards his sexuality, and that of his bretheren. The unsaid mantra is that it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you keep it quiet and do it in private. The Line of Beauty is indeed a richly textured coming-of-age story, and accomplished adaptation of a classic work of literature set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade of change and transformation.

Big name cast adds up to unfocussed dud. The worst movie of this genre.+N+Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies+dvd
Katie, CT+P+I love Gwyneth Paltrow in general, but especially when she blows us away with her perfect English accent.  The plot was interesting, with mystery, drama, suspense and of course romance.  I totally recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good love story+dvd
requiem+P+I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.    Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, "a tour through hell."  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.  During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.  All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.  I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.  The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.  Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.  All in all this is an 5 star film+dvd
It hurts so bad...+P+This is not just a film about teen angst altho it is that also; extremely so. But it is more so an allegory about how wrong our middle class American culture can go and how, horrifically, the American Dream can turn into a nightmare as much for the people who go on living it as well as for the titular suicides. I think James Woods and Kathleen Turner were excellent casting choices as the parents and both roles that were so out of type and yet fit so perfect that you have to wonder who was inspired to cast them. It hurts so bad to watch this movie but you can't help yourself because even though you're watching for the 5th time it still sucks you in and you really start to root for this family to pull it all together and save themselves. Every time you root with all your heart; every time+dvd
The Itsy Bitsy Problem.+N+By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie+dvd
Really good although all over the place at times+P+This film is about a young porn star who of course had tragedy in her life.  When she was 12 her mother committed suicide.  After her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops Parkinson's Disease.  At 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life.  She juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by Rosario Dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher.  I really enjoyed this film but couldn't help but feel like the actress who portrayed Moon was doing her best Angelina Jolie impersonation, I mean she had Angelina down pat.  James Wood deserves an Oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down. I enjoyed this film, but like many other films I was frustrated with the story at times.  It seemed to be all over the place sometimes.  I never knew if the love story between Moon and her blind date was going anywhere, then we see Mon venture off into a new business, then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis'.  Although it was all over the place at times, it was a great little indy film, the best indy film I have seen since "Secretary.+dvd
It is like they dropped the slides of the movie and mixed it up+P+This movie is really fun because they mixed everything all around and made it confusing.  Pay attention the other person is right.  This movie is for people who like art movies.  It is violent.  Some people cannot follow it, but those who do love it.  I really loved it.  It is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off, but it is really great.  This is one you have to think with and pay attention to.  This is not something to walk in and out of.  It would not make any sense at all.  Not one for kids.  They will be really confused.  It will take so long to explain it to them and still you may not be able to.  A smart teen could probably understand it, but some adults cannot.  If you are reading reviews I am sure you can.  It is some great mental exercise and so much better than other movies when you want something of more substance+dvd
This film knocked my socks off!+P+Cronenberg a little more restrained than usual -- except in the jolting scenes of violence, and in the question of how and if we can change who we are. Fantastic performances all around.  I was very impressed+dvd
Pathetic+N+Stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid. Though made during the Cold War, its portrayal of Russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review I read elsewhere, it was described as xenophopic. I would go so far as to say it is propagandistic. Its the kind of film which will appeal to today's dumbed-down American who thinks he's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior. The idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film+dvd
The Firm+N+Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD+dvd
Very interesting+P+This video was quite interesting and mind opening. A lot of it is in subtitles which wasn't a problem for me and it is rather short, just over a 1/2 hour. Overall though, a very interesting DVD+dvd
:0)+P+I enjoy watching this movie, jim carey to me is a great comedy actor, very humorous and funny at times and very much watchable and great to add to your collection...+dvd
not better than channel surfing+N+Other reviews rant about Ms. Judd; frankly, after Double Jeopardy and High Crimes, I'm not seeing the superb actress, but that's aside the point.  This movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else--  Search for truth, not innocence.  Especially if you are an attorney+dvd
Waste of time...+N+As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, I really wanted to like this film.  I enjoyed them in Kiss The Girls, and I expected another interesting film.  Their performances were the only bright spot, but they couldn't rescue this movie.  This film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream.  There was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible.  As many other reviewers noted (I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces), it was so very predictable.    I rented 2 films yesterday, and I had trouble watching both of them, for very different reasons.  The other film was "Monster", starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.  I almost couldn't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and I forgot that it was a movie.  It absolutely is a gripping story, and Ms. Theron richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she received for it.  Conversely, I almost couldn't watch High Crimes because it was so ridiculous.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one. +dvd
The Mothman Travesty+N+Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon+dvd
A Quiet, Chilling Masterpiece+P+Whether you're drawn to suave action heroes tossing out wry quips while emptying machine-guns into charging hoards, or of nearly wordless, hours-long existential explorations of meaningfulness and nothingness, "I'm Not Scared" will likely find in you a delighted new fan.  For the subtitle-phobic: take a risk!  "I'm Not Scared" is refreshingly original, quietly chilling, and continually surprising to the end.  The cast, led by 10 year-old Guiseppe Cristiano, is uniformly solid, and the Oscar-caliber photography is nothing short of brilliant.   The smart, effective score never gets overly dramatic nor does it tip the audience as to how it's "supposed" to feel. Its quiet beauty merely serves to support and bind the elements of the story, while standing humbly in the background.    I discovered this film quite by accident, having read no reviews, and now consider it to be my "find" of the year. I recommend "I'm Not Scared" without reserve or hesitation to anyone who ever wondered what his or her parents really did to make their money+dvd
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE+P+The main theme of this film is well known and very well worked out.  Two enemies meet in a neutral surrounding.  They want to kill each other, but by one reason or another, they don't.  Sounds familiar?  Well here we have an extra twist - a woman.  None of these three people understand each other; they speak different languages and they have different backgrounds.  There is no understanding but yet there is some.  They feel each other.  The film is smartly complemented by the excellent director's work, superb acting, top cinematography, and the beautiful scenery of (Laplandia - Korelia) the northern Russia - southern Finland.  This was the territory the Soviets aggressively took away from the Finns in 1939 in the Soviet - Finish war (the forgotten war).  That is when the Finish snipers and the brutal winter destroyed the Soviet Army but still a little country as Finland could not defend itself against the Soviet might.  I give this film five stars and a very warm recommendation to everyone to watch it.     +dvd
Friday / Next Friday / Friday After Next+P+The movies were shipped quickly, and the dvd's are of great quality+dvd
Manipulation+N+this is a crass emotional manipultion..all be it well produced manipulation that gives the viewer a warm fuzzy feeling while very slyly promoting war..suggesting war is a duty to your country or what have you. At the same time manipulting the viewers emotions very very effectively.  War is mass indescriminate death of fooled young men and innocent civilians directed by millionaires who's prime purpose is to profit from the killing.   Think for a minute about what you're being told behind this mass of emotional manipulation+dvd
Charming Story - Outstanding Animation - Good Family Movie+P+Set in the suburbs of Tokyo, "Whisper of the Heart" is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one's first true love.  The teenage main character, Shizuku, wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world.  While she is a voracious reader, she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view.  After meeting a hansome boy, Seiji, who both infuriates and intrigues her, Shizuku sets a personal goal.  Because Seiji knows he wants to study violin making in Italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills, Shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer.  During the course of Whisper of the Heart, she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work, one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories.  A subplot is Shizuku's relationship with Seiji's Grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience.  He teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work.  He also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending.     Other than the scene showing Shizuku's writing, the story has none of the strange characters, magic, or fantastic settings of other Studio Ghibli U.S. releases.  (In my opinion, some of their best real-life style stories such as "Omoide Poro Poro" do not translate well into American culture or the American market.)  The animation is fantastic, which I attribute to the detail Studio Ghibli includes.  This is the film which gave rise to "The Cat's Return" and several of the characters are found in both (the Baron, Muuta).  Regardless of the subject matter, I was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling.  My wife and I often set the language to Japanese with subtitles (my Japanese is abysmal) and as we found with "Kiki's Delivery Service," the translation of the Japanese dialog is better than what was written for the English version.  Those with some knowledge of Japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story.  These include studying for the High School admission tests and the "Goodbyes" of long-time classmates following junior high school.  I found this to be a good family movie and highly recommend it, particularly to anyone with teenage daughters.+dvd
A Horrible Movie+N+The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it+dvd
This is an artful piece of direction.+P+I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round.   The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but "Lemony Snicket..." entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!).   There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmï¿½n, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film.  It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences!+dvd
Dry comedy for people who don't like dry comedy+N+This show deserved to get cancelled, and there's a very simple reason.  This is supposedly dry, subtle comedy for people who don't usually like dry, subtle comedy.  It's a show that was presented to the FOX audience, an audeince that normally likes the most inane, low-brow kind of humor, that doesn't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it.  Meanwhile, to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor, the so-called comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable.  Every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke, it's clear how forced and contrived it is, how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor, something they clearly don't understand.  It's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch, because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat.  It's just an awkward mess.  But those aren't the people this show is targeted at.  It's targeted at that FOX audience who has never even seen dry humor before, and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them.  They think this show is brilliant because it's a little smarter than MAD TV, or at least thinks it is.  And since those are the people who are seeing the show, you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is.  If the show were on HBO or some other network, exposed to a different kind of audience, you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works.  So why did this show get cancelled, when so many people think it's so amazing?  If it's so great, people would have actually watched it, right?  So where were the ratings?  The fact is, the people who love this show are a very vocal minority.  The audience for dry humor didn't watch this show because it's not funny.  But the audience who was fooled by this show, as vocal as they are, was just too small:  they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it.  This is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for TV, as its apologists claim.  No, it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes+dvd
The Little Mermaid:  Classic Disney+P+This movie is just as good as I remembered. It's a classic Disney fairy tale, full of love, longing, fear, action, and beautiful songs. And the scene with Sebastian and the chef is priceless! If you haven't seen it yet, you can't miss this film+dvd
Great content - lousy packaging!+P+I'm in the UK and therefore it cost me quite a lot to have this package shipped over the Atlantic but it's the only way to see this series until way into next year. As has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the DTS disc (the very one I want) is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last 4000 miles! The disc surface is now scratched and damaged. I see no point in sending it back to Amazon for replacement because the chances are it'll happen again so I'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance. This item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it's a great shame+dvd
Certain times I like it, others I don't+P+How do you separate a socially important film from a great film? Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be.  Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays.  One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose.  Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington.  Is it a watchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent. I don't know whether you should blind buy it though, that's up to you+dvd
Plot is absurd; acting is fine+N+So: alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to--well, won't give the plot away, but trust me, they're not here to guests on Martha Stewart. And I find the plot, therefore, and all of these "aliens as terror sources" movies just--can I say this?--not fair to aliens!  OK, I don't have an aluminum foil hat on, I just think its childish. Stephen Greer, MD's "Hidden Truth" book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from Hollywood--no more friendly E.T. types, just constantly the message of terror from the skies. This trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable. And how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie? Oh, you don't want to know..+dvd
Get up and work your tush off+P+I've had this video since '95'.  I have been on a mission to find a  video that is equivalent or even half the work out.  No luck.  When I get done with this video I feel like I actually worked out.  Awesome exercise video, I wish there were more like it+dvd
An unconvenient truth+N+When the scientific facts about climate change are seriously looked into the only inconvenient truth is Vice President Gore needs to find another celebrity cause.  A passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory.  It quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late '70s and early '80s didn't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming. What should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it's theorists is to vote for a certain political party.  Sorry, nice try Al. Perhaps if you spent more time cleaning up the heavy metal pollution found on your own property you would convince more people+dvd
"I saw you in an orange grove..."+P+James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film+dvd
INSPIRATIONAL MASTERPIECE+P+Flawless movie making at its best! Patriotic and powerful telling of the true beginning-of-the-end for the Confederacy. Ex-slaves and free blacks alike, finally allowed to defend their dignity, were the final blow to the Southern bondage of an entire race of human beings history tells us. The Truth based story of the Massachusetts 54th. Only the beginning of black heroics during the Civil War.   From the dignified talent of Morgan Freeman, to Denzel Washington's Academy Award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway, great acting to suit everything else about this film. And another level of respect achieved for Matthew Broderick indeed. So many standout scenes, but most memorable, Denzel's beating. Back already scarred from his cruelly treated past, he takes his punishment in total silence. Only allowing a single tear to fall during a cinematic closeup. Heartbreaking.  The highest rating possible.+dvd
Mag(nificent) Max+P+With all the drek that video stores carry, it's amazing that I had to join an online rental service to see "Rushmore", the best comedy, and one of the most entertaining movies I've seen this decade.  "Rushmore" has every aspect of a great movie--script (by director Wes Anderson and writer/actor Owen Wilson), casting (Jason Schwartzman got the starring part as Max Fischer after a long search; Bill Murray is perfect as Herman Blume, and Brit Olivia Williams is lovely as Miss Cross--I'm not sure why she hasn't gotten other good parts; even the minor characters are very well cast), direction (by Anderson--highlighted by the montage of Max's extracurricular activities at the title private school Rushmore), acting (see Schartzman, Murray and others), soundtrack (somehow '60s British invasion works perfectly for this tale from the '90s--The Faces "Ooh La La" topping everything), and a happy, but still satisfying ending.  And on top of that, there are plenty of very funny lines and the delight of seeing both "Serpico" and "Platoon" produced for the high school stage.  Max Fischer is one of the best young characters created for a movie, and the rest of the great cast and production work beautifully around him.  Very highly recommended!+dvd
Life and times of a Hardcore Legend +P+He must be broken half ......JR could have invented that phase just to use it in every Mick Foley match. Foley made a career by taking bumps, but he is also a great wrestler and this DVD goes along way to showcase that.   So stop reading this review and buy it+dvd
Splendor of budding teen sexuality+P+This is a must for all Natalie Wood fanatics!The girl is beautiful and talented. The film is honest and compelling for it's time.  Altough sometimes a little too "opinionated" in sexual themes such as the fate of Beatty's "tramp" of a sister and the dividing of bad and good girls, the theme that the Warren Beatty's charachter is ready for sex and Natalie's isn't IS portrayed very honestly and movingly.  See also the first french kiss on a hollywood movie!!Blink and you'll miss it+dvd
Watch it with Gettysburg+P+I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well+dvd
I liked it!+P+I especially liked seeing the "Legends of Batman" episode that brings to life the old Batman style of the 1940 & 50s.  It was a lot of fun to watch+dvd
Melvin should have another serving of paste+N+Directors, actors, and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral.  It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal.  99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end.  The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie).  It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy.  This falls into the latter category.  I want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun.+dvd
I love most of Bob Odenkirk's work...+N+I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie+dvd
For die hard Kutcher fans only.+N+The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one+dvd
COME ON NOW!+N+IT'S A REAL SHAME & COMPLETE IDIOCY THAT NUMBER 1, THIS SHOW ISN'T SOLD AS A SEASON PACKAGE & NUMBER 2, THAT THEY CAN'T SELL IT AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE.  For example, if there was a dvd that had a complete season for around $20 or a dvd that had the complete seasons 1-3 for no more than $40-50, this would make sense. It was a great show, but come on now lets be sensible & reasonable about thi+dvd
"R"-Rated movie, NOT PG-13!!! Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+N+I've read the other reviews and I don't know what version they got but the DVD I received has more than a brief scene of David with his wife (breasts CLEARLY exposed)in bed. That scene alone would not be allowed in a PG-13 movie. There is another scene where David is viewing Bathsheba bathing. She is standing, completely nude and you can see everything. Then the camera pans in close for a "waist up" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body.  This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut+dvd
Enchanting movie...+P+This is one of Miyazaki's best. In the vein of 'Totoro' but a bit more grown-up. It's probably my favourite after 'Nausicaa', which is his masterpiece.  There is a quality to Miyazaki's animation and story-telling that is indescribable. You have to experience it to understand it. The attention to detail and the intimacy in his narration is really special. Though it's probably easier (for English speakers) to watch the movie with the English dialogue, it's so much better with the original Japanese soundtrack. The English dialogue lacks the softness and subtlety of the Japanese version. This is a great family film; a film people of all ages can enjoy. I am definitely going to be buying the DVD, 'cos I'm going to want to share this movie with friends and family+dvd
*Yawn*+N+I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.  The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).  The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.  The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).  The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.  However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.   Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.  Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.   The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.  For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.  I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.  So, I give it two stars. *Yawn+dvd
Total body workout+P+I haven't done this workout in awhile and thought I'd wipe the dust off of the cover and try it again.  I forgot how challenging this workout is.  The lower body almost killed me.  I could hardly step down off my TransFIRMer when it was over.  Which is good b/c I need more strength in my lower body.   The  upper body was hard (I didn't think it was as hard as the lower body though), with the push-ups killing me every time.  I forgot how much I enjoyed this workout in the past.  I will definitely add to my rotation.  I had the VHS version, but I'm glad it's on DVD now.  Having it chaptered is easier, in case I want to do lower or upper body only combined with another FIRM  workout+dvd
Heartwarming. Satisfying. Vindicating. Heroic,+P+I wasn't expecting much when I dropped this 1998 movie into the DVD player...  There is a lot to commend itself. Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner.  The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue.  The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process.  Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect. +dvd
Best Lesbian Film!!!+P+I'll keep this review short and sweet, it has it all and in my opinion is the best lesbian film ever made. It's one movie that made cry and made me laugh and left me wanting more at the end. All of the actresses were fantastic, my particular favourites were Vanessa Redgrave and Chloe Sevigny.  These were no cheesy performances which unfortunately are common in many lesbian movies, and it's a movie you can watch over and over again. Worth any amount of money+dvd
Great Play, Must See!!+P+This was a great play, Deborah Cox was wonderful, the singing of all the characters was unbelievable.  The interaction between the male characters was hysterical.  The character of Khalif added just the right amount of spice to the pot without being over the top.  All in all a great play about the African American male-female relationship at all different age levels+dvd
Endearing Sequel +P+This is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow-up to ANNE OF THE GREEN GABLES. It is great to see Megan Follows as Anne Shirley once again. Megan Follows is just perfect in this role. Anne Shirley is now a bit older, has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings. This gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable. It is very endearing in many ways as was the original+dvd
The Character of Martha Dunstock+N+Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.+dvd
Seriously people this movie is funny+P+Other reviewers that dont get the humor and take this as a serious movie need to LIGHTEN UP! Seriously this movie cracks me up and I dont get sick of it. I've watched it several times and it still makes me laugh every time. If you are a stoner you'll probaly "get it" a little better and be laughing at these two clowns as they do bust out tons of funny catch phrases, but it is what it is, a stoner comedy made for stoners to laugh at. If you like these type of movies this one is pretty original for what it is and definitely worth adding to your collection because it isnt one of those "watch it once and you're over it" movies it stays funny+dvd
The can be written for a Democrat, or Republican+N+For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie+dvd
I wish I could go lower than this. +N+This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny.+dvd
(:D) its good for me+P+I use to be a  dancer. I danced for 10 years and quit because of the pressure of being good and etc and i don't regert it but i do miss it a little. I'm addicted to dance movies. This one is one of the best I've seen Great thats all i have to sa+dvd
bad version of 'prizzi's honor'+N+this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow+dvd
Someone should have 'saved' me from buying this...+N+Bought this dvd for only 10 dollars at a not-so-local shopping centre, only because they didn't have this movie to rent at the video shop.  After so much publicity, trailers, ads on busses, you'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around.  However. I nearly fell asleep in it. Had to turn away more than a few times in boredom. And cliched to infinity, just watch the ending.  Pathetic and predictable. If you like predictable movies? This dvd will be your new best friend. If not? Try something with a bit more imagination+dvd
The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter+N+The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though+dvd
Top notch entertainment+P+I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a "blockbuster" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a "blockbuster". But it's also a damn good story, as  mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous "You can't handle the truth...." line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either+dvd
Not your typical all american flik+P+This film is so sweet and whimsical.  The cultural aspects depicted in the film are what amused me the most.  The two love stories intertwined into one main plot is very well put together.  This has been my favorite film for several years now and just watching it again made me remember just how much I love it.  I highly recommend this international film for those who like to venture into other cultures for entertainment.  This is a must see! Love some of the music as well!+dvd
Absolutely the best comedy I've ever seen.+P+Well, nothing I say will be new considering the number of reviews but here goes:  I have never seen anyone get into character like Ricky Gervais did for David Brent, the transformation is total.  Even after watching the series and seeing Ricky in interviews it's hard to believe they're not two distinct people.  The super-ego of David Brent is so hard to reconcile with Ricky's humble nature.  The humor on the show is top notch almost completely subtle, even the extremely obtuse humor is funny on a subtler level.  The two episodes which comprise the Christmas specials, as The Dude would say, really tie the series together and leave me with a feeling of closure with regard to the series.  The supporting cast did their jobs perfectly, each normal in their own way with the exception of Garreth.  This normality highlights the ridiculous nature of David's ego and cognitive dissonance and makes his character even more hilarious / uncomfortable.  Perhaps most importantly, the feeling that the cast is having a lot of fun comes across the more you watch it.  Thanks, Ricky and Steven for creating this spectacular and unforgettable series!+dvd
"You are go for the moon."+P+I agree with the space nerds yelling "Sananaigans!" over the footage from different missions being put in here to look like it was all from Apollo VIII.  It kind of makes you feel ripped off.  Example:  The space walk footage was actually from the Apollo 9 mission!...or so i've read.  Also as a person who knows very little about the space program I was disappointed in the lack of fact giving narration.  The footage is breathtaking and I learned a lot, but I wanted more information and I wish they had put up a disclaimer telling when there were images not from the Apollo VIII mission.  Worth watching preferably on a large high definition television.+dvd
Ouch+N+Let me start by saying that I love indipendent features and support them fully.  A movie like this threatens my support. The actors ( I use that term loosly ) are just dreadful and don`t have any emotion. The " dreadful sex scene " is only dreadful in the fact that they wasted good film to shoot it. The SFX are passable and the story is just a retread. Do not waste your time with this. I have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features. It reads exactly like the review that is quoted on the case.  If you want to see how good indipendent features can be purchase Van Bebbers The Manson Family or the upcoming Actress Apocolpse.+dvd
Very nice romantic drama.+P+I origionaly didn't want to watch this film I mean come on a film starring Sandra Bullock but it was my girlfriend who suggested that I watch this film and said that I might like it and now I admit it was pretty good. Sandra Bullock plays a woman named Birdee Pruitt who believes to be happy with a perfect life until she appears on national television and hears her best friend confessing to an affair with her husband. She then leaves her married home and travels to her birth place in Texas where she begins to rebuild her life and relationships especialy with her mother and young daughter who hates Birdee. I was surprised that the film didn't have any cliche Hollywood moments and it dealt with human emotions and was realistic, Birdee has to overcome the humiliation and public betrayal she obviously has a lot of problems but soon Harry Connick jr.'s character comes along to hopefully win Birdee's heart since they knew each other from Highschool. The film was very uplifting and in a way it is a serious romantic drama with a bit of humor so I enjoyed this film alot and I didn't hesitate the fact that I like Sandy in these roles and everybody else gave a great performance and I hope that she stars in more films like this instead of those awful comedies, I highly recomend this film+dvd
Luther - - Best Historical Presentation of Martin Luther  ever+P+This DVD is the Best Historical Presentation of Martin Luther ever and the corruption that existed in the Middle Age Church, which would not change until there were such violent protest in Northern Europe.  I recently purchased 7 copies and in total I have purchased about 12 copies to give as gifts.  I also requested our local library purchase a copy.    I do not consider this DVD as entertainment, but it is History done better than any other Historical Film.  One should also research the events occuring in England, and the Americas which were part of the Holy Roman Empire, and understand that Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, is a great-nephew of Catherine of Argon, King Henry VIII's first wife; and that he is also a decendent of Ferdnand and Isabel of Spain.  The DVD will allow you to see the logic behind selling Indulgences and the need to finance St Peters Basilica in Rome.  This is a DVD that you will want to view several times as it is so profound.  Peter Ustinov and Alfred Molina give unforgetable performances in supporting roles+dvd
Soooo corny~!+N+Ok, this movie is for either Black people, or White Woman. Then, you may enjoy it. This is soo silly and corny I want my money back. Interesting idea, but...no thanks. LO+dvd
TEN STEPS BELOW ZERO! A REAL BOMB!+N+This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere should have given every cent they received on this movie for charity! Horrible acting and plot. Julia and Richard, I hope you get to read this one day.+dvd
ANOTHER TOSHIRO MIFUNE CLASSIC +P+This is a really great movie. And another one of the many, many great movies by the late Toshiro Mifune. It is both a comedy and an action movie rolled into one. Enough has already been written by so many reviewers about this movie that I don't think I could add any more but to say that this belongs in every cinema collection. Thank goodness it is part of the Criterion collection. Kurosawa definetly had a sense of humor when he made this movie. With Mifune selling his services to both of the warring clans, you know there's going to be hell to pay. This film never disappoints the viewer, and after years of repeated viewing, it never disappoints me. Highly recommended+dvd
a good first yoga dvd....for someone else!+N+i consider myself a beginner yogi (have been to about 5-7 classes over the past year), and i found this video to be extremely unchallenging.  this video might be good for someone recovering from an injury AND who has never tried yoga before.  although sara ivanhoe comes off as a friendly, non-threatening gym buddy, i just couldn't overcome the total lack of breath awareness that seems to be a basic part of yoga.  also, i am not in very good shape, and i didn't even break a sweat during the 'fat burning' workout. +dvd
To buy or not to buy+N+I was dispointed from seying this movie. After seing Wild Orchid movies, 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting Wide Sargo Sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it. The course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee. I did not get the point of this movie. it's worth renting. But I certainly would not buy it+dvd
Disappointing.+N+I love the A-Team, but this box set left me disappointed. The description stating Dolby Digital 2.0 for the audio track is misleading since the audio is in mono, not stereo. I was also hoping there would be "some" extras in the set in addition to just the episodes+dvd
An eye-opener+P+Different people are struck by different things in movies, and what struck me about this one is that it is about community. People always form themselves into little villages, even if only one block square in a big city. There's always a vague, loose hierarchy, with what you could call the village elders at the top--in the case of this movie, Cedric the Entertainer. Then you've got the laziest and most dishonest at the bottom--that would be the guy who cheats on his girlfriend and sticks another woman under his bed when she shows up unexpectedly. The barbershop itself is the community gathering place. That's really what this movie is about--community, neighborhood, and how people interact in it+dvd
These CD Mixes Rock!+P+A must buy just for the CD with these truly inspirational mixes to rock out with. I play this CD over & over & always love how Maynard's lyrics move & inspire me.   R+dvd
Cheetah Girls +P+I love this movie i watched  a lot and i cant wait to get the Cheetah Girls 2 movie in Nov or Dec they  my favorite movie and i  all the girls in it they did they parts well+dvd
Lucas Strikes!+N+NOTE: This review is not about the trilogy (which is great). This review is about the many DVD releases.  The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.   The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the "Limited Edition" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release.  Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him.  One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one.  +dvd
For Trower Lovers+P+Robin Trower defined that rich, full overdriven modulated (Hendrix-inspired) sound of his way back in the early '70's, and he still lays it on thick.  As a guitarist, i can't help but to STILL love that "sound", even after 30 years!  This DVD will serve Trower up to you on a platter.  Hey...i don't care if the guy looks like someone's Grand Daddy standin' up there .... we're all growing old too, right along with the stars of our youth.  It's great that he can still pull this stuff off and come out sounding as fabulous as he does.  (No arthritis in THOSE hands, i can tell you.)  Now, if you DON'T love Trower, the show will probably get a little old after a few numbers.  But if you DO love him (and that "Sound" ...), and particularly if you play, you'll thoroughly enjoy this DVD+dvd
if i could give it 10 stars+P+This may not be my favorite movie ever, but if its not then my favorite is no better. This film is beautiful, not only in its comedy but in its truthful tone hidden beneath the slight absurdity. I really can't say anything other than if you like wes anderson films, or anything even loosly associated with it then go now and watch it twice+dvd
A regular snoozefest.....+N+This is a dumb boring movie. I actually think this movie would be better to watch in 2d than 3d. The 3d in this movie sucks badly, and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting, direction, characters, and storyline-- one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for 3d scenes that simply do not deliver.   If you are looking for good 3d--PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. THESE "REVIEWERS" WHO REVIEW THIS MOVIE EITHER HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH THE STUDIO THAT RELEASED IT OR SIMPLY HAVE NOT REALLY EXPERIENCED ANY GOOD 3D MOVIES AND ARE JUST REVIEWING OUT OF IGNORANCE.   The field sequential in this movie is horrible, due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place indoors- inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field!! I dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential......if there is no depth to the picture...then there is no REAL 3D!  If you are looking for BEYOND EXCELLENT 3d, then get yourself a copy of "Alien Adventure", "Encounter in the Third Dimension", or "The Haunted Castle". I have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile.....  I love horror, I love 3D, and I love cult and B movies but this movie just could NOT hold my interest for long.  I have stopped and started it 3 times since I have received it, and have yet to finish the end of the movie.   Again.....maybe in 2d--but stay away from the lousy 3D version.  It downright sucks+dvd
An unforgettable experience+P+Most of you guys for sure remember that day on july 1985 when suddenly you turned on the tv and dozens of bands played all day long their best songs for a noble and humanitarian reason. When you buy this CD remember that you are helping to save human lives in Africa, and that is worth much more than the wonderful songs that you will listen here. The best performance of all? probably Mick jagger's give me just another night, the Cars' heartbeat city, David Bowie's Heroes, Queen We are the Champions, U2's (birth to the world) bad, Tom Pettys' Refugee or Duran Duran with hall & Oates+dvd
a crappy movie from a crappy time+N+GA. how can anyone stand this drivel? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly. worse than watching "walk tall" 8 times in a row. worse even than watching the home shopping network. eww. EWW+dvd
A wonderful, immensely entertaining film+P+Too often, Hollywood directors seem to forget that cinematic success comes in the form of great characters.  Doc Hollywood, though, is one of those films that proves the rule.  This movie is chock full of great characters, even in some of the smallest of roles - and it's not just the people, for the small town in which the story takes place is quite a character unto itself.  The town of Grady is sort of an updated version of Mayberry - idyllic, of course, but nonetheless charming and evocative.  It's the kind of place you can only find in the South.  Of course, Dr. Ben Stone (Michael J. Fox) has blinders on when he first arrives.  Having just left the hustle and bustle (and blood) of a large D.C. hospital, he's on his way to La La Land in hopes of snagging a cushy job in the lucrative practice of cosmetic surgery.  On his cross-country drive, he gets as far as South Carolina before fate steps in, leaving Stone temporarily stuck in the small town of Grady with a banged-up sports car and a judge's sentence of thirty-two hours of community medical service.  Grady is in great need of a new doctor to replace the aging Dr. Hogue (Barnard Hughes), and everyone in town (well, almost everyone) - from the mayor (David Ogden Stiers) to the official welcoming committee of ladies and on down to the local farmers - makes no bones about their hopes of enticing him to stay.  Even the glory of the annual squash festival can't do much to equal the scales, though, as California promises fortune and excitement, while a practice in Grady promises only a barely decent salary and quiet, country living.  Predictably, though, Stone finds love - or at least the prospect for love - with the local ambulance driver.  He and Lou (Julie Warner), a single mother and aspiring law student, engage in a lot of mutual flirtation, but she quickly becomes something much more than a mere conquest for Stone, which makes his decision whether to stay in Grady or snatch the gold ring in California much more difficult than he ever would have thought.  With the help of a fantastic cast, Grady quickly begins to feel a lot like home for the viewer.  With just a little interaction here and there, you really come to know a vast number of people - the mayor, the local mechanic, the judge, old Doc Hogue, the implacable Nurse Packer, the illiterate family who depends on the doc to read them the family letters they receive, and the list just goes on.  Two of the faces are particularly recognizable: Woody Harrelson plays Lou's would-be suitor, and Bridget Fonda (whom I have long adored, despite the fact that she's a Fonda) plays the mayor's daughter, a young lady who longs for the bright lights of a big city.  David Ogden Stiers, I have to say, is just wonderful as the mayor; he's the exact antithesis of the Bostonian intellectual he played for so many years on M*A*S*H.  I can't say that all of these actors and actresses sounded all that Southern, but it's not their fault that they weren't lucky enough to be born here in the South.  You might be thinking this sounds like just another story about a city slicker won over by the charms of small-town living.  Doc Hollywood could easily have been just another boring version of an old story, but this film has a special quality that turns it into so much more than a predictable comedy.  Thanks to nuanced directing, rich storytelling, and wonderful acting, more than a few of these characters have a remarkable depth that you pick up on very quickly.  Grady isn't just a town; it's a way of life, with a genuineness you don't often find in any kind of film.  Stone's ultimate decision does not come down to anything as simple as romance vs. money.  Certainly, his feelings for Lou are deep and genuine, but the town of Grady and all of her citizens sing a siren song of love that Stone hears, as well.  As for that ending, it doesn't play out exactly in the manner you might expect, and that's just one more reason to love this wonderful movie+dvd
GREAT remake... dare I say better than the original+P+Now, I'm not trying to hate on the original. Obviously, it's a classic. But, come on. It's boring. It's black and white and slow. And I'm sure it scared your parents and was shocking and all that good stuff.  But it needed to be updated.  The two main characters (including the CandyMan) deliver some great acting. I'll admit the other characters are a bit weak, but that's made up for by the zombies being incredible.   This movie really shows (by driving the point home a few times) how humans don't know how to treat each other. It's not just a horror movie. It actually has a point to it and makes a humanitarian statement. Rent it, buy it, whatever. But check it out. It's a great movie+dvd
WB makes one grave mistake+P+I am currently watching some of the episodes of this season, but if you watch the entire opening sequence of the DVD before selecting from episodes, play, etc, they give away the twist endings for a few of the episodes.  For season 6 & 7, PLEASE WB, put back the Crypt Keeper where you can select an episode+dvd
Morvern Callar: Requiem for a Plot+N+The pretentious film goer has never had a greater ally than Lynne Ramsay's Morvern Callar.  What is little more than a bland stew of typically successful indy film techniques (hand-held shot, character-based, amoral, unique, hip, naked) becomes an immenitely defensible, but truly awful film.  To merely skim the surface:  Why Morvern is touted as a study of progress, liberation, or self-discovery is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film; indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack.   Although other indy film goers may crucify the non-believers, this sort of  movie is equally disgusting as the bloated star-powered behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision.  That sort, however, is only after our money.  Morvern Caller is after something much more dangerous: our admiration.  For more information on Lynne Ramsay's film, see: "No Skin Off My Nose," a succesful, art-house play prominately featured in The Fountainhead.    +dvd
classic story of fortitude and wisdom+P+Our family finds this film a classic.  We could watch it over and over and learn something new.  It gets you thinking, self-evaluating, and admiring.  It is entertaining with the landscape and plot, as well as the clever wisdom of this great man.  We love it.  (We are not catholic, but could see this being of particular interest to someone of that faith.+dvd
A beautiful story of love and family+P+There comes a point in almost everyones life when we wake up and realize we're no where close to where we thought we'd be.  I'm only 21 and I have had that day.  George (Kevin Kline) has had one too.  He's a forty-ish architech who's fallen out of touch with his estranged ex-wife and his children, most notably his teenage son.  Whats worse yet is that, upon realizing his failure as a parent, he finds out that he hasn't much time to make it better.  He's been diagnosed with cancer and his time is short.  George decides to get to know his son by building his dream home with him.  George's son (played BRILLIANTLY by newcomer Hayden Christensen, and if you'd seen Chistensen on the TV show Higher Ground then you already knew he could pull this off) is far from thrilled about the quality time he'll be spending with his father and is determined to get out of it, or at least make his father miserable during the process.  What's heartwrenching is that George hasn't told anyone about his condition, but once it's revield you can only imagine the heartache in store for the central charactors, including his ex-wife played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Kevin Kline gives the performance of his career here, as does Christensen who plays the gothic loner prostitute with so much conviction you feel for him every second of this film.  As the movie winds down to its tear jerker of an ending you'll be left wondering if you've done all you could to be the best father/son/mother/wife/husband you could so that when you pass you'll be remembered favorably.  One can only hope.  Beautiful film..+dvd
Don't get me wrong...+N+...I'm a huge John Wayne fan, but this movie has some serious shortcomings, including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that, while acceptable at the time, are not so well received today.  I won't knock John Wayne's acting, however, because he performed it as only John Wayne could.  But some of the other acting was downright daffy, like when the singing Eddie Powers (William Frawley) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine.  ... The Fighting Seabees wasn't a totally bad movie, and I thought the formation of the SeaBees (if this movie is accurate) was very interesting.  But some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better+dvd
ugh+N+This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it+dvd
Great Play, But Look At The Editing+N+Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision+dvd
Yuck!+N+This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck+dvd
Don't Waste Your Time+N+Uneven, choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable Meryl Streep.  Unfortunately, not even the fabulous Ms. Streep can save this -- recommended for devoted fans only, bent on completing their Streep collection+dvd
Sounded better than it really is+N+Getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth...and they were all for buying it+dvd
all humans must go+N+this is a "horror" movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage.  I don't mean the acting is garbage, though it is.  I mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage, such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them.  If the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a one-man murder wave, then... bingo.  I am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat.... blow away the cast+dvd
Probably one of Sandler's most unappreciated+P+Yes, I am an Adam Sandler fan, but I'm not obsessed about him as some of his other fans are. I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad.   Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name.  I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish like Billy Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES. +dvd
Two myths meet within a century old anthropological myth+P+What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ï¿½ The Old Curiosity Shop ï¿½. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.  Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonn+dvd
loved the 90's workout+P+after doing Kathy Smiths old style prenatal video and leisa hart's fitmama video, i had to try one of leisa hart's oldie videos and was so happy to find she had one on dvd...it was a blast seeing the thong outfits from the buns of steel videos, i really can't wait to do more after my pregnancy, but this is a balst to modify some of the routines, this was a really old style dvd+dvd
Disappointment+N+I was very disappointed with this product...be Warned this is not the movies it is only the special features of them+dvd
Complete Waste . . . +N+. . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back.  the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened.  Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive.  not quirky or interesting.  they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that.  and did i mention it was boring?  so mind numbingly boring.  there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting.  i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this+dvd
A Favorite Movie on Love and Christmas+P+My wife and I laughed, and were brought to tears throughout this movie.  It is an interwoven number of stories about Love and relationships - and the hardships and highlights within familes.    The acting is great - and we have watched this move many times over the last couple of years+dvd
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are+P+When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.  Branford Marsalis comments about Sting's music:  The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say "This s$!t is out."  Bring on the Night is a movie about the launching of The Dream of the Blue Turtles album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, "If You Love Somebody Set Them Free" is a response to his earlier "Every Breath You Take".  Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.   In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, "I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think."   Good protest songs are made to be sung.  One world is enough for all of us.  Love is the seventh wave.  I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.    Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.  This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.  If you are a fan of acapella or minimal accompaniment, watch the film to hear the amazing, open versions of both Roxanne and Message in a Bottle.  Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related works+dvd
It's about time!!!+P+I have been waiting a long time for a decent Gallagher DVD to be released, but it has been worth the wait. This compilation contains 11 full length Gallagher concerts including:  Disc 1 "Mad As Hell" "Two Real" "Stuck in the 60's" "The Maddest"   Disc 2 "Melon Crazy" "Over Your Head" "The Bookkeeper" "Overboard"   Disc 3 "We Need A Hero" "Messin' Up Texas" "An Uncensored Evening"  These all appear to be unedited and uncut since there original airing. I used to catch these concerts re-aired on Comedy Central on Saturday mornings but have not seen them for about 10 years. I am SO happy that they finally released this great collection of Gallagher works... his comedy has already stood the test of time for over 20 years, and with this DVD, Gallagher can be introduced to new audiences and remembered by his fans.  There are also 2 "Best of Gallagher" DVD's that have been released, and I am wondering if they are just highlights from the 11 concerts contained on this "Smashing Watermelon Collection" or if they have different material on them.  Hopefully someone will review them soon.   If you like Gallagher, I am sure you will buy this collection... but even if you just like comedy, you should get this in order to realize just how smart and funny Gallagher really is and you will discover how much influence he has had on many other comedians.+dvd
Idiotic movie about really stupid people+N+Maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking, but I doubt it. Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I've bought the Eminem CD. And there's a little more to them than the stupidity. But let's discuss the movie.  Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it's ironic that she's trying to dress ghetto while he's trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?)  The movie's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their "crew" and if the gang didn't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn't know that that's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell's Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie.  The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls' character from Hustle & Flow (and Hustle & Flow in and of itself) since that's a white character in a black world that doesn't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He's just himself whereever he goes. He's someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn't you rather just see them all shot dead?+dvd
Don't see what the hype was all about+N+I was 4 years old when this movie was released, but I vividly remember Irene Cara's smash song of the same name in 1980 (especially the chorus of, "Fame, I'm gonna live forever") and, after so many years, I was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was I disappointed.  I was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour.  The audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes.  After this painful sequence, the movie finally gets underway.  I tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and couldn't do it.  I appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts (it IS hard work - everybody's an actor, dancer, and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it), and I definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment, but the movie just didn't flow for me.  Perhaps it would have to do with the fact that I'm not one of those people who isn't proclaiming to anyone who'll listen that I'm an "actress" (and who rolls their eyes at those people who do).  Besides the slow pace of the story, "Fame" is very dated.  The off-the-shoulder top (that became the rage of the early-80s due to Cara's video) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that "wonderful" decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie.  I don't get the hype about this film at all.  - Donna Di Giacom+dvd
No Flab ABS+P+Anyone familiar with TaeBo and Billy Blanks knows that together equals PAIN and SWEAT.  TaeBo is for people that understand you must sweat to burn fat and calories.  This DVD helps you do just that.  Billy Blanks has targeted in-directly on the problem areas once again.  Before I started using TaeBo as a workout strategy I was wore a size 12.  I am now a size 8 and even the 8's are loose.  So I'm very pleased with Billy's AB Bootcamp DVD and all the others that I have.  Any of his cardio targeted dvd's I will also highly recommend.  Billy's AB Bootcamp DVD is the ABsolute answer to a trimmer waist and stronger abs. It's a way to have a six-pack even if you don't drink. TJDELUM  in Mphs, T+dvd
Biting Chayefsky satire+P+Accomplished director Sidney Lumet directs a insightful and prophetic satire from the expansive mind of Paddy Chayefsky critiquing the business of network television production.  CCA corporation frontman Frank Hackett played by Robert Duvall has taken over UBS network with the idea of finally turning it + into a profitable situation.  Lagging in ratings behind the big three, Duvall focuses on the news division headed by Max Schumacher played by the aged but excellent William Holden.  Duvall's plan calls for the firing of long time news anchor Howard Beale played superbly in Oscar winning fashion by Peter Finch.  A disconsolate Finch announces on air that in one weeks time, he will blow his head off during his newscast.  His ratings take an immediate bump which comes to the attention of intensely obsessed TV generation programing vice president Diana Christiansen played by Faye Dunaway.  Dunaway encourages Holden to keep Finch on the air, against his better judgement but the ratings hike eventually flattens out.  As Finch's time in gradually coming to an end, he has a bedroom epiphany which inspires him to come on the air after walking the rainy streets in his pajamas.  In a heartfelt spew with wild gesticulations he calls for those watching who are frustrated with their existence, to open their windows and yell that they 're mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore.  His rant strikes home and before long he is a media darling with the number one rated show.  This opens the door for Dunaway to fill her programing schedule with wild and revolutionary shows which threaten to drive UBS to the top of the network heap.  As profits soar, corporate head Arthur Jensen played by supremely talented Ned Beatty is pleased.  However Finch goes too far with his angry prophet routine speaking out against corporate business practices.  He receives an angry rebuke in a brilliant soliloquy by Beatty, who decides that due to a ratings drop that Finch must be silenced.  A combination of Lumet's top notch direction, a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make "Network" an all time cinematic classic+dvd
Love is All+P+I have just finished watching Lorenzo's Oil for the first time and I have never seen acting like this. Susan Sarandon and Nicke Nolte should have won oscars for their performances. It is the most intense, inspiring movie you could ever hope to come across. The epitome of what love between father, mother and child can encompass. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.+dvd
weak+N+This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of+dvd
Who let the dogs out? +N+I am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival, and I have to agree with anybody that says this movie is [...]. The whole cast is wasted in this movie, and most of which I have seen in movies that I liked better. Like pretty much the leads in this movies, I have seen thier movies and liked htem better in, but this one, they might as well. If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs. Here are 99 minuts of my life, that I won't see again, and I am trying to make sure that you don't waste your time on this dud. Who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog, in some scenes in the movie, ore pretty much the whole thing. I haven't seen Monster House or Cars, but I hope that these will be 2 better movies, or maybe a season dvd of Home Improvement will be pretty then this. Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant & Strictland. And he doesn't much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh's PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.        +dvd
Best yet+P+I have season one thru season 4 and season 4 is the best of the series.  The cast has matured and so has the episodes.  Even though I had heard Johnny Depp did not really want to be there he does a great job with his character.     +dvd
I'm just glad I didn't actually PAY to watch this!+N+We checked this out from the library a couple of years ago.  It really was torture to watch.  The acting was terrible, the costumes were even worse.  I don't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad, because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production.  Not one of BBC's better efforts+dvd
IF you paid a buck for this, then you paid 99c too much.+N+Absolutely do not buy this video.  1) The fights are not fights. they are boring and tiresome staged tapping, pushing and pulling matches. Nobody wants to hurt anyone, and nobody wants to get hurt.   2)Jerry Springer fights are 10 times better than anything on this video. These girls keep their clothes on , and tussle like 4th grade girls at a sleepover.   3)ModelFight.com has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they don't fight.   4) The most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say "you better get out my room ! *smiling* *No, You get out !* says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed.   Complete waste of time and money.  You want chick fights, look elsewhere.+dvd
For a Few Dollars More....+P+....you can buy them all separately and maybe get some actual liner notes!!! When I bought this, I thought the Slipcover holding all three films was pretty nifty.  What weirded me out was that all the movies were not shrink-wrapped, and the liner notes or liner card on the inside front covers were missing.  The topper was my copy of Fistful of Dollars had rip marks on the very top of the back cover paper.  I'm about to put them in the player to see if I'm getting top quality or irregular materials.  My advice is to just buy these separately+dvd
You will love this movie.+P+It has all kinds of movie stars in it. I love comedy movies and this one is a diamond in the rough. Must have+dvd
One sweet comedy!+P+The title says it all: Sugar & Spice. It's a sweet yet sour comedy about the A-squad cheerleaders and their sister-like friendship as they all unite to help the head cheerleader, Diane (played by adorable Marley Shelton) and her quarterback boyfriend support the twins they're expecting. I watched this movie not knowing anything about it, and I honestly thought as soon as Diane learns she's pregnant and gives her boyfriend the news, that he was going to leave her, but he couldn't have been more happy. In fact, the only people upset with the news are their parents who disown them, leaving the young couple to fend for themselves. They marry and take minimum wage jobs to pay for their apartment and the expected twins, but it's not enough. But that doesn't stop the A-squad from coming up with a heist plan sure to give the couple the cash they need to care for their babies. Told from the point of view of a bitter B-squad cheerleader, this is one of those fun movies like Mean Girls that's funny yet sweet without being too sugary. It will leave you cheering for these good bad girls the entire way. Enjoy...this one is definitely a keeper+dvd
Just Sleep-Inducing: Yet Another Pointless Remake+N+John Carpenter's `The Fog' may not be his greatest film, and that is exactly the reason for remaking or improving it. The character of vengeful Blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics, and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today's special effects. Revolution Studios seems to have thought the same way, but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself.  What is wrong? The answer is clear. That is the film's incoherent storytelling, which made me dizzy while watching it. The original's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact, and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town (or an island ... whatever) shrouded in a fog. So far, it's good, but the problem is how to tell this story.  Apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions. It can sneak into a kitchen, but not a fridge. It can turn a human into a mummy-like corpse in a second, but it uses that trick not much, because it seems to know that the CGI is costly. The lack of consistent logics just helps make the film scare-free.   Slow and sleep-inducing pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film's plot. In horror films I usually don't expect much from the characters, but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid. If you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer, you won't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend. Forget the law of physics here. If your car crashes, overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea, you would get seriously hurt. Not in this film, because of the driver happens to be the star of the film.   New version of `The Fog' is not scary. Well, the original was not that scary, but it was moody and stylish. They certainly did change some part of the original, but none of the changes make sense. So ... why did they remake it+dvd
"Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.  The attorneys will provide the wisecracks." +N+Upon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center.    Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.   Stewart is his dependable self in "Anatomy of a Murder."  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  "Anatomy of a Murder" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as "Anatomy of a Murder" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case+dvd
Doing the Right Thing+P+Terrific cast explores the question of ethics in the world of G.I.'s upon their return from WWII. An examination of the value of honesty in communications, whether in the marketplace or in the home. Interesting for period detail.+dvd
New transfer on the VIP Edition+P+Everyone here seems to want to chime in their own commentary on the film's content, so I'm only going to bring up the only thing that matters--how does this new transfer measure up?  The new anamorphic widescreen transfer alone makes upgrading to this edition a no-brainer. If you are trying to decide weather to get this hopped-up edition (VIP), or the old version, this is the one to get. Who cares about all the junk in the box, I gave mine all away, I just wanted the new version of the movie. As of this writing, the VIP edition is only way to get the anamorphic version.  The older, original issue of this film is non-amamorphic and will not be suitable if you have a widescreen or a 4:3 HDTV with 16x9 enhancement (unless you want use the "zoom" effect).+dvd
Ah, to be twentysomething in Seattle in the early 1990s!+P+This film genuinely surprised me when I first saw it in theaters in 1992.  For me, Bridget Fonda was the main draw at the time, as she received top billing and was on the movie posters with Matt Dillion.  It felt like a bait and switch, because the film focuses more on Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick's relationship, even though they aren't featured on the poster.  That's no biggie, because I enjoyed their storyline much more than Bridget and Matt's...but I bet Campbell and Kyra weren't happy to be excluded on the poster/DVD cover.  This film has it all...great music suitable to the period (grunge/alternative), fantastic use of place (Seattle in a starring role), interesting and quirky characters, and true to life portrayal of young people in their twenties negotiating through life as they find their true passions.  I especially loved Campbell Scott's performance and he is the true star of this film.  His job is working on creating a "Super Train" to get Seattlites out of their cars and onboard for their commute, because he believes that "if you give them great coffee and great music, they'll ride."  His girlfriend, played by Kyra Sedgwick, has her pulse on the masses, by telling him, "I still love my car, though."  She's an environmentalist who drives an old gass guzzling clunker of an automobile, which Campbell pokes fun at after a lunch date.  Its a joy to watch their relationship grow from initial doubts to lover games about how soon after a date one should call to other challenges that crop up.  I especially love the scene when Linda (Sedgwick) peruses Steve's (Campbell Scott) record albums and gets nostalgic about her college days.  That scene epitomizes the exciting "getting to know you" stage of dating and rings absolutely true.  The choice of music in that scene, and throughout the entire movie really enhances the scenes overall.  Probably the only thing I didn't like about the film, which is just a tiny critique, was Janet's (Fonda) almost groupie-like infatuation with Cliff (Dillon), who didn't seem all that interested in her (until she moves on with her life).  They are a mismatched pair if there ever was one...Janet with her ambitions for Grad School to pursue architecture, and Cliff the stereotypical Gen X slacker working menial jobs to support his rock band career that probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.  Janet should have hooked up with the plastic surgeon who doesn't know how to have fun!  This dvd would be made even better with a director's commentary track.  Cameron Crowe could divulge a lot of interesting information and insite jokes that the average filmwatcher might not catch (like when the mime says, "wooo woooo woooo" in response to a guy who says he works for Boeing, or when a reporter asks Cliff what the song "Touch Me, I'm Dick" is about--which is an inside joke on the actual song "Touch Me, I'm Sick").  This film is so ingrained into the grunge culture of Seattle of the early 1990s, that future audiences could use a lot of background info a director's commentary would provide.  At any rate, this film is a joy to watch, and cheaply priced that it's worth having in one's collection.  And buy the soundtrack while you're at it+dvd
Wolf's rain part I and part II+N+I bought I and II of this released Wolf's Rain because when I first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending.  I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed because now that I have the second part there is no alternate ending and I now see that that review has been deleted. I think Amazon handled this whole thing very poorly.  We depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices+dvd
HAHAHAHAHAH+N+This movie was extreamly stupid, but very funny.  We just laughed though this hole movie.  This was pretty much very soft porn.  The hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them.  The special effects sucked, they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes (the black and white ones!!).  The acting was very bad, and this movie is very anticrist+dvd
Boring Fluff+N+I recently gave this movie another shot, at the request of a friend.  I was impressed, this time, with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography.  It's as if every scene could be a postcard, and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing.  And the songs are great, if a little "forced" into the movie.  Unfortunately, that's all there is, except beautiful Brad Rowe, totally wasted here in this nothing piece about self-indulgence and galling disregard for everyone that loves you (while pining away for what you obviously can't have.)  Add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others (Sean P. Hayes' character) while simply pursuing your own desires.  ("I want to be there for him.")  Right.  It's so artificial, it's about as convincing as plastic palm trees.    There are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers, but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long, heart-felt pauses of nothing.    Someone made this picture to fulfill their dream, and did a fine job of casting and cinematography.  There is little else to see here.  Even as a fluff piece, it's barely worth your time+dvd
A total waste of time and money - Its a movie full of lies+N+I watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies. He did his best not to divide India and it was all Jinnah who divided and founded Pakistan. Gandhi was totally against it.  In short - Wasted my money. I would rather be watching a silly comedy show. That must have been atleast better than this movie.+dvd
Burr did not answer straight+N+Unfortunately I had already ordered these DVD's before I logged onto the bar method website, on the site there are news clips posted from old interviews etc. I read one interview where she was being interviewed at her studio and the reporter was being givin a lesson via a tv segment all about her method. when asked if this was all Burr did to keep in shape, she replied " pretty much" sounded like a vague answer to me, the interviewer asked again later in the segment, so, this is all you need to stay in shape,, once again she answered pretty much, seems to me if you were excited to share your program and sell it, you would say,Im in great shape and this is all I do! I have tired it once and you definately feel it the next day, so we will see. Yvonne+dvd
Deal with it, he ripped off Hicks+N+Why do you think Leary doesn't do live shows anymore?  Hicks isn't around for him to steal material from!  And that is precisely what Leary did.  He took Bill's material, excised anything controversial and intelligent (as in all of Bill's political work), added more profanity to attract the ignorant, and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material, rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator+dvd
Adam Sandler shows surprising depth+P+Punch Drunk Love gave Adam Sandler a chance to show that he can play a serious role.  There are plenty of laughs in this  picture but one can never laugh AT the main character.  He is faced with what appear to be insurmountable odds, and he is a "nice guy."  Therefore, the audience is hoping that somehow things will work out for him, but it is very uncertain what will happen!  This picture is a bit dark, so be aware that you may find yourself shocked at times, but hang on to the end.  It's worth it! +dvd
Tour de force acting!+P+There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.   We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions    On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.  One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.     Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh. +dvd
WHAT THE...+N+THIS MOVIE IS NOT VULGAR NOR DOES IT RATE NC17...DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. CHECK OUT PINK FLAMINGOS INSTEAD, NOW THAT IS A VULGARLY RIGHTEOUS MOVIE BY WATERS AND THE WITH THE GODDESS OF FILTH..DEVINE+dvd
I get it now+P+So this is real-life anime. Wow. I'm stunned. Where Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress failed, Tokyo Godfathers greatly achieves. I loved this film. It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package. And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved. And all of their efforts comes across as genuine. Excellent+dvd
10 Stars!+P+I can't say enough good things about this movie. I watch a lot of anime, but I have to say this is the most well animated movie I've seen. You completely forget you're watching a cartoon. The characters just come to life. All of their subtle movements make them seem like real people. Especially Hana the transvestite. She was animated with so much attention to detail. It's so incredible! And then there's the story. Three homeless people find an abandoned baby and go out searching for the mother. These characters show so much heart and you really find yourself caring for them. And each of their situations for why they're homeless are all so real. So then they find the mother and then there's a huge twist in the story which I wont give away. I'll just say the ending is a miracle.  Fantastic movie+dvd
Captivating+P+Although I am not attuned to the background history of the film, the visuals are captivating enough to hold anyone's interest. I have visited the site of the film, and the footage comes as close as possible to capturing the magnificance of the rainforest, the Potaro River and Kaieteur Falls. The scenes with the locals are right on+dvd
Like It Even Better on DVD+P+To be honest, I loved the Japanese original of this movie so much that my first watching of the American version was a little tainted. But I just watched the Richard Gere version again, this time on DVD, and found that I really like it more than I realized. Gere is so winsome (I'll pay to watch him dance any day, he is aging gorgeously!), and Lopez so elegant, and all the other characters so interesting, and the music so sexy, why quibble over which movie is better? This story is entertaining and touching in its own right, even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the Japaese version. I have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years, and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions. The story is charming, adult and PG with a  satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days? The DVD offers good insights into the ballroom training and hard work behind the movie, as well as a wonderful "Sway" music video. Which reminds me -- the soundtrack is excellent, and I bought that, too.+dvd
Cheap Sopranos rip off falls way short+N+I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.  It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.  The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.  Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.  This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.    Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.    +dvd
Mostly uneventful and somewhat pretentious+N+I like Glenn Gould.  I didn't care for this movie however. 1)  The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting. 2)  Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life.  One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations.  Big deal, this is not interesting.  I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking.  Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady.  Thats it. Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?  Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries.  Now he is putting his change in his pocket.   How utterly profound....  In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie+dvd
A Little scary+N+Ballroom and Latin dance has come a long way.  Even though many of the dancers on the DVD are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit, this is NOT a great showcase. This is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today, but not the kind of video you will watch over and over.  The only truly spectacular dancing is that of Marcus and Karen Hilton (standard only).  They were then, and are now quite amazing.  For those of us in Canada, Alain Doucet and Anik Jolicouer are on this tape, briefly, in the Standard final+dvd
The emperor's new clothes+N+Despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality, this film is a complete put-on. The long "set-piece" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being "essential for character development" or "boring". In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything "happen" narrative-wise.  2 stars is rather generous, but De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause. Ultimately, despite some controversy, many of the film's questionable portrayals of Vietnam, Vietnamese, America, Americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy+dvd
Hold your nose+N+I thought Colin was sleeping at first. I didn't realize he was "acting sensitive".  It would be more interesting to watch paint dry, than this slow, boring, pointless movie.  So, his friend is gay, big suprise, and Colin movies to New York to live with him and kooky girl.  Who ever thought Robin Wright could look ugly?  She used to be an attractive girl, I guess living with Sean Penn must be very stressful.  You probably guessed the plot - kooky girl really loves gay friend, but Colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the "unconventional life" thats even more boring than living in the "burbs".  They are the most conventional "unconventional" bores of all time.  Either overdose on black coffee or skip this one.  For extreme Colin fans only.  Enjoy! +dvd
Excellent Guide +P+I ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200.  Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense.  There are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the D200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos. I highly reccommend it+dvd
did they read the book?+N+it seems like the actors didn't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts!  amanda root is terrible as anne elliot... overly timid and shy... captain wentworth isn't at all handsome or dashing... and when they finally get together at the end, it's so awkward, bland, and unclimactic you wished you'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book... some people might have liked it, but i definitely didn't.  to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like, i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice.  this movie could have been bette+dvd
I love Gilbert!+P+My favorite film of all time. I have the original dvd but bought this one purely for the bonus material, which, as far as I'm concerned, is worth every penny. New interviews with all the main characters, including Johnny Depp. Interesting commentary from Lasse Halstrom and Peter Hedges if you like to know the ins and outs!!! Money well spent+dvd
Great stuff+P+this dvd has 5 great episodes including: shadow dance retreat the hex factor and day of reckoning parts one and two buy this great dvd+dvd
Kurosawa's modern crime drama+P+Crackerjack suspense yarn by Kurosawa based on the novel KING'S RANSOM by Ed McBain. Toshiro Mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product (shoes) for a bigger profit; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe.   But then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded, only it turns out to be NOT his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time, his chauffeur's son. He's faced with a moral dilemma: should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially, or not? He decides to pay and get the boy back; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper.   At this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural. The kidnapper's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer. Mifune is ruined at the end, but public support is behind him. It's a great crime drama; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit. What I found most fascinating was how differently the Japanese police handled the case from the way American police might - so much more compassionately. Definitely worth a watch+dvd
Hands Down, The Most Realistic WWI Combat Film To Date!+P+All I can say is wow!  This is Ricky Schroeder?  No way!  Rick does an unbelievable job in this movie and proves himself to be a true actor worthy of extreme praise.  The story line is excellent and true to the actual event the movie is based upon.  They spent the time and got all the details right on this one, the historical accuracy is extremely impressive.  This is not a "chick flick" as it has a lot of intense close quarter combat, which is not the case with many modern WWII films.  That makes some parts of the movie a bit graphic and nasty, but WWI was graphic and nasty.  The hand-held camera work is a bit jumpy and almost too over-the-top in trying to place you "into" the action at times, but the movie is certainly good enough to overcome the overzealous camera work.  If you want to know something of WWI combat, there's not a better movie out there right now - at least that I know of.  With all due respect to "All Quiet On The Western Front" of course - both versions. The Lost Batallion should be in any military enthusiast's collection.+dvd
The best!+P+I absolutely love this workout DVD. It is by far my favorite. The music is fun, Janis is a wonderful instructor and her kickoboxing moves really pump up my cardio. I highly recommend this one for people who like kickboxing. Plus the bonus is that each segment is 10 minutes, so you can do it all or mix and match+dvd
Bax Experience+N+I ordered this movie on or around July 6, 2006 and have yet to receive it+dvd
"She loves me!  I can tell that through her screaming."+P+Very funny, I love the ol' classic screwball comedies where everyone is screaming hysterically, running madly and falling all over each other.  Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe, played with psychotic brilliance by John Barrymore, is a hyperactive megalomaniac stage director who after discovering Carole Lombard and making her into a gigantic star smothers her with his controlling nature until she finally has enough and leaves for Hollywood.  After she leaves he has nothing but flops until he's in danger of loosing his theater, so in one desperate last ditch effort he tries to get Lombard back.  How neither Howard Hawks nor John Barrymore got an Oscar nomination for this movie is a mystery to me.  D: Howard Hawks (RIO BRAVO, BRINGING UP BABY)  Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe - John Barrymore (GRAND HOTEL, DINER AT EIGHT) Lily Garland - Carole Lombard (MY MAN GODFREY, TO BE OR NOT TO BE) Oliver Webb - Walter Connolly (IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, LIBELED LADY) Owen O'Malley - Roscoe Karns (THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) Max Jacobs - Charles Lane (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE) Mathew J. Clark - Etienne Girardot (THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME '39) +dvd
"She is led by love. The world moves for love. It kneels before it in awe."+P+Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.   I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.  I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say "I hated the ending, very predictable" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.  So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.  If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.  If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)  And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie.   But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film+dvd
times like this amazon needs a no star option+N+I myself am a huge Buffy/Angel fan,  I had read the reviews here and I thought it was worth a shot seeing it.  Well The script was terrible,  the story even worse,  direction - don't get me started.   One reviewer said it,  it was like they didn't know whose point of view to choose.  The soundtrack was awful.  The ending was sooo stupid.  did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them...  they just keep standing there.  Like nothing is happening.  I really haven't seen a movie this bad in... well...  EVER!!  Oh and Alyson Hannigan's acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role.  Don't get me wrong she's a extremely talented actress...  I blame it on the script.  rent it,  don't buy it.  You'll be embarassed to own it.  I am+dvd
An Absolutely Gorgeous Movie+P+Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers+dvd
A wonderfully ridiculous bit of fun+P+This is a very delightful bit of silliness.  Do you remember how visually wonderful "Chicken Run" was?  Well, this is even better.  Wallace is a daft inventor who, in this story, is running a humane pest removal service named "Anti-Pesto" and Gromit is his intelligent and loyal dog.  Gromit is the one with the common sense and is the only one in the whole film who seems to know what is going on.  And Gromit never says a word.  However, he is quite expressive and we always know clearly what is on his mind and why he has the concerns he has.  The town is concerned about the rabbits eating their vegetable gardens because the annual giant vegetable growing contest is about to be held.  The sponsor is a local hereditary heir, Lady Tottington (wonderfully voiced by Helena Bonham Carter).  She is being courted by the scoundrel Victor Quatermaine (voice amazingly by Ralph Fiennes).  He also loves to shoot rabbits, but this bothers her ladyship and once she meets Wallace she becomes more taken with him and his humane ways.  Wallace comes up with the idea of trying to condition the rabbits to not want to eat the vegetables and things have to be stopped before the process is completed.  The rest of the movie is working out all the crazy details of the unexpected results of the partial experiment.    Lots of fun and quite a visual treat and a stop-action / animation triumph.  Enjoy+dvd
It will pull your heartstrings!+P+When this movie showed up on a movie channel, I almost skipped it, but I am so glad that I didn't! I enjoyed the characters so much, including the insane little seeing eye b*tch! There were so many feelings involved. The film was funny, a little crazy, touching, sad, and very, very moving. I loved getting to know the Russian or Ukrainian people and their culture; the old as well as the new.    Alex is so charming and funny at the same time, with his ideas of hip hop and the American culture; and wisdom that seems beyond his years. Elijah Wood was wonderful as the eccentric little American Jew named Jonathan who seemed very meek and a little bumbling (he had a phobia of dogs and almost couldn't get into the car with one), but he was amazingly brave to go on his quest in a country he knew nothing about to find the woman who helped his grandfather escape from the Nazis in WWII. Alex's grandfather, who insisted that he was blind, yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in, was such a character; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he'd had in his life, and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while.   The Russian songs throughout the movie were perfect and pulled you right into the story. The scenery was amazing. It all made me want to visit Ukraine. If you haven't watched this movie, do it!+dvd
Try not to compare it to the book....+N+Jonathan Safran Foer's book is a truly literary work and this movie is not a book. And, as many have already said in Amazon's ratings, this movie is not like Foer's book.  It is, unfailingly, cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria. Thus, although I will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie (the cinematographer captures an oddity, serenity, and disturbance) I cannot agree with those who give it high marks.  The plot is sparse, as is much of the character development.  I am especially disappointed with the portrayal of Alex and his grandfather.  I found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or Alex in the movie's final dramatic scenes.  The grandfather's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does Alex's reaction to his Grandfather's action.  Morevover, the parallels between the JSF character and the Ukranian characters seem forced.  The only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative's backstory.  Overall, I felt untouched by this movie.  And one last note, why is it even called "Everything is Illuminated?"  That title illuminates little within the movie+dvd
Why oh why?+N+Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...  Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.   First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!   I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.  If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.  Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one+dvd
Fantastic+P+This is a fantastic DVD. I am new to Qi Gong and this DVD was very easy for me to follow. I have arthritis in my upper and lower spine, neck and both hips. I was able to follow everything and my entire body had no pain during the DVD and for four hours after I was finished. The day after I first did Qi Gong with this Detox DVD. My body got rid of many toxins, both physical and mental. A must have in your collection+dvd
The Magic isn't There+N+This is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times. The Owens girls are hereditary witches, any man who loves one is doomed to an early death. There is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion, this requires the sacrifice of a dove. Two little girls watch. Years later they're grown up. One leaves to live with her boyfriend. But the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck (never stand in the middle of a road). We see scenes where the neighbor kids yell "witch", as if to symbolize something.  Sally goes when Jillian calls her; she has a problem with her boyfriend. But Sally uses a "magic potion" to eliminate the problem. Now Jillian wants to undo what was done. [The film began to lose me now, it wasn't funny.] The spell goes awry, they bury their mistake. Then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles. Later an investigator comes around looking for Jimmy. [The story drags again.] More scenes follow; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining. But a scene in the attic will wake you even if you're snoozing! They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian. It seems to work, even if they don't use the standard issue witches broom. There is a sort of happy ending.  Sandra and Nicole are good actresses, but they can't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I've ever seen. "Bell, Book, and Candle" is a funnier film, "Blair Witch" is a scarier film. This falls between the cracks.+dvd
Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?+N+OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics+dvd
Truly Disappointing+N+After I read Erik Larson's wonderful book "The Devil in the White City" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes' story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of "Mondo Carne." With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn't it+dvd
What a waste of time!+N+Well, that's part of my life I'll never get back!  I can't figure out why this movie got such great reviews; I was totally bored by it.  Don't waste your time; there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk+dvd
great+P+this was a great season. and i got the dvd's within three days after ordering them. and at the time it was a great price+dvd
WOW!!!+P+The greatest show ever to hit T.V. You will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great,It always keeps you guessing and wanting more.C.T.U(Counter Terrorist Unit) and C.T.U operative Jack Bauer(Keifer Sutherland)try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time. What I like about this show is that Keifer Sutherlands character Jack Bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against C.T.U or the President. Another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show, so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more. You still reading, stop and go buy the first season right now. Hell, buy all 4 right now thats how good it is+dvd
The War is Over but the Battle Lives On (WWE vs TNA)!+P+The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews.  I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD.  They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW.  I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info.  Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection.  I just wish they added more matches and interviews.  TNA better watch themselves.   +dvd
Gross and funny as hell!+P+I finally got around to watching this movie.  I had heard that this was a black comedy of the quality of "Saun of the Dead".  I wouldnt go that far, but I do give this movie top marks.  Ever since I saw "Serenity" at the movies, and then started watching the TV series "Firefly" I have been a big fan of Nathan Fillion.  He is brilliant in this movie too.    The premise is nothing better than the usual 80s horror flick, but that is part of its charm.  The effects are gross, the "heros" are scared, the monsters are slimy.  What more could you ask for?  Well the answer to that is you want to be entertained.  "Slither" is a movie which does entertain+dvd
I knew there had to be something wrong with this DVD!+N+I received this DVD from my brother who is possibly a bigger Kevin Smith fan than I am. I thought the fact that he was  giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until I watched the DVD myself.   The Degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and Jay and Silent Bob's toned-down appearances don't help much. I really liked the original Degrassi series so I was disappointed by this DVD.   There are some funny moments in the "Extras" section of the DVD but I would still only recommend this as a "rent" or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan.    +dvd
the best animated movie in the mid 90's+P+Batty was a lab bat who escape into this rainforest he is very intellegent he can change his voice. The fairies think humans no longer exist cause a long time ago the evil Hexxes who drove them off even killed some of them. Zak has a job a cutting down tree's for a living, he was shrunk by Crystal the fairy who does find him cute. She shows him how he is hurting tree's+dvd
Very light on baby care basics+N+This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like "pre-birth preparation," which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a "ultimate baby care DVD."  The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says "over an hour of hints"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of "you should always consult your doctor" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.  I've seen this DVD and the "ABC of Newborn Baby Care" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.  BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price+dvd
A Big Waste Of Time!!!!+N+I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder+dvd
Infinitely improved by being on DVD+P+Now that Rattle and Hum is on DVD, the brightest moments shine so much brighter and the low lights are eliminated through the magic of the fastforward button. The menu allows you to pick which song you want to see performed and oh what performances. The versions of "Exit" and "Sunday Bloody Sunday" are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Both are liable to send a chill down your spine. The live versions captured here of Bullet the Blue Sky, With or Without You, Running to Stand Still and others are also excellent. In 5.1 sound, it's nothing short of brilliant+dvd
In a word: disgraceful+N+The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.  There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.  The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.  The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.  If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd+dvd
BUTTERFLY'S WINGS CLIPPED+N+This movie is not so much a sequel to the original, but simply a film that borrows that film's premise and tries to rejuvenate it with different touches.  Ultimately, it doesn't work because the script and pacing are weak, and although Eric Lively and Erica Durance are charming in their roles, their thespian skills don't really convince us they're sincere in their performances.  There is also no real explanation for Lively's abilities and when he makes his final "return", why doesn't he just not go to work and then maybe...well, don't want to spoil it.  It's not a rotten movie, but it's merely another direct to video release that won't stay with you too long+dvd
Fantastic - Full Length & All Music - This Is The One To Own+P+Great childhood pictures of Karen and her brother. This video is non-stop music combined with photos and videos from the past. Especially for those who heard the Carpenters on the radio day after day, this video is a real treat.+dvd
Every puzzle has its pieces+P+The best psychological thriller I have seen, this movie will leave you in shock by the end. Smart and cleverly written by Aussie's Leigh Wannell and James Wan, and directed by the latter, this movie breaks down all the boundaries of on screen violence. Starring Wannell himself, his character Adam wakes in a bathtub in a room with no lights. He calls out for help and hears a strangers voice, the lights come on revealing the two chained and shackled in a grimy, abandoned, windowless industrial bathroom. And so the game begins... The two prisoners are victims of serial killer Jigsaw, well he really isn't a serial killer as we find out. He puts his victims through a dangerous game to test their will to live, and its up to the victim if they live of die. This movie is one hell of a rollercoaster ride which will appeal to fans of both horror and psychological thrillers. It was voted one of the most scary films of all time, and while I didn't find it too scary, its the reality that these crimes could happen to anyone that is most frightening.  Filmed in only 18 days, most of it filmed in a warehouse, this is quality filmaking by a young up-and-comer. Many studios knocked this back which they surely must regret as it went on to gross over 55 million dollars. Buy it if you liked Seven, Kiss The Girls, The Bone Collector and Red Dragon+dvd
A Gay Classic+P+This movie is one of those "must own" movies that belongs in anyone's collection, and definitly should be included in every gay man's movie cabinet.  +dvd
Awesome+P+For the longest time we have had this classic on VHS. At last we have upgraded. The quality is phenomenal and let's face.... Who does not love Indy?????+dvd
BREAKING NEWS!!! THIS IS BORING...+N+JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.  OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE!  NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP+dvd
I didn't like it.+N+I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch.  It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film.  The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments.  It is not a movie I would readily recommend+dvd
Good Viewing+P+This collection brings back vivid memories of how grand motion pictures used to be+dvd
0 STARS: This is pure nonsense.+N+We got Jason in space and we get Pinhead in space.  This is pure nonsense.  Words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels: when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people, it's time to stop making these movies!+dvd
Bizarre Entertainment +P+The greatest crime you can commit whilst watching a David Lynch film is to NOT watch it in one-sitting; a reason as to why Mr. Lynch did not condone the insertion of chapter breaks in the original 'Mulholland Drive' DVD&#8212;it happens to be the incentive for the viewer to sit through the whole film in unremitting concentration, a sort of meditation. It would also explain his infatuation with 'Transcendental Meditation', which he claims to have been practicing for a number of years, and his desire to instill that peace into his cult following. So, if by any chance you want to unravel this smorgasbord of haunting sexuality, bloody violence, and the mystical bizarreness which is 'Lost Highway' then it is wise to stray away from the conviction of a linear plot. It is much more lucrative to compare the chief theme of each his films rather than trying to put together the scattered images of one film&#8212;let&#8217;s say, as an example, the 'Mystery Man' (Played by Robert Blake in this particular film) and the 'Cowboy' from 'Mulholland Drive'; you can draw the correspondence at once by comparing their facial elements: mainly the shaved eyebrows. Therewith, one can surmise what Lynch tried to personify by those two characters&#8230;a singularly obscure despot&#8212;evil&#8212;like the devil, and also the gateway into the supernatural. Indeed, in a recent interview, director Lynch confessed that Lost Highway and Twin Peaks take place in the same world&#8212;which is more than enough evidence for us to navigate all his films since 1977&#8217;s 'Eraserhead' and search for cohesion on the whole rather than through one individual film. All this aside, 'Lost Highway' is certainly a worthy experience; it is singularly intriguing, interspersed with bizarre sexual liaisons and a chilling soundtrack&#8212;a mix of hard-edged techno-industrial, slightly spooky jazz, and orchestral compositions from Angelo Badalamenti. Patricia Arquette & Bill Pullman pull off memorable performances as the husband and wife whose marriage is on the rocks, Balthazar Getty is thoroughly convincing as the 'reincarnation' of Fred Madison (Bill Pullman&#8217;s character in the story) and Robert Loggia playing the sinister mob boss with insidious perversions. 'Lost Highway' may at times frustrate you with its non-linear narrative or it just might not be on-par with your taste, yet you don&#8217;t have to be genius to figure out that during our brief span of consciousness David Lynch certainly knows how to screw our nerves.  +dvd
AUGH!!!!+N+So Close, and yet so far.  I have been watching Swamp Fox since I was a kid.  Unfortunately, one horrible night, I accidently hit the record button when the tape my dad had it on was in the VCR.  We lost 2 and a half epidodes!!!!!!  Maybe 1 and a half, but all the same, I have always grieved the loss.  Anyhow, My little bro saw this in the store and started dancing.  Much to my dismay, however, when I investigate it, I find not only not all the episodes, but they are out of order!!!!!!!  How could this happen?  As for Elfego...  He is great too.  My dad also had him on recordings, and we watched him all the time.  So this was a doubly pleasant surprise.... until I read the details.  ONLY 3 BLOOMIN EPISODES?????  You have got to be kidding me!!  And they are out of order as well.  Disney, You were so close to getting $30 of my money, and you just lost it...+dvd
Change of heart  . . .+P+This is a gently heartbreaking film set in Tehran, a city flooded with Afghan refugees during the time of Taliban rule in their homeland. It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.  The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor. Recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media+dvd
Ebert and Roper are Morans+N+In a another patheic performance, Keaton plays a plyawright whose fate seems tied to wither the Red Sox win the 1986 world series.  Ebert and Roper liked this movie, but most preview audiences did not and there for it is only getting a limited release.  It also boasts a rather lame performance by Robert Domey (who does the worst Christopher Walken take-off ever).  This shows how out of touch movie critics are with the movie going public+dvd
Excellent yet realistically frightening.+P+This story of a Jewish woman in search of her father (separated from him as a child in 1927 Russia), in a time when the world was on the verge of war, is heartbreaking and very real. It is low key but I was riveted. You can feel the underlying tension of knowing, and the subtle buildup of the inevitable invasion of Paris. It chilled me to the bone in one part to hear the sounds of the Germans marching into the city. The movie, considered a sleeper, shows the frightening reality of what it was like to be there at that time in our history and potentially in danger if you were Jewish, a gypsy, homosexual, etc. The acting was superb. John Turturro (Dante), brilliantly plays an Italian arrogant, selfish, self-centered, manipulative opera singer who tries with no success to ingratiate himself romantically into Suzie's life (Christina Ricci, the heroine of the film). Her performance was also excellent. The look on her face throughout the film shows her haunted, yet with a quiet strength in her determination to eventually reconnect with her father. Her rejection of Dante causes her friend and Dante's ex-lover Lola (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett who's Russian accent was excellent) to leave Paris and go to America because her life was in danger. In the interim Suzie has fallen for Cesar, a gypsy horseman played by Johnny Depp, yet another excellent performance. Some people are comparing this gypsy role with the one he played in Chocolat. There is no similarity except for him being softspoken and unassuming. Definitely not a "character reprisal". Not Depp's style. The only character he's reprising is his pirate, Jack Sparrow which by now the whole world is aware of.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending. The second it ended, it was like I was thrown into shock. Not one for abrupt endings unless the film warrants it. This one did not. But don't let it stop you from seeing this movie. Really holds your attention. I'm so glad I bought it.      +dvd
awful, horrible, ridiculous.+N+i cannot get thru this one.  i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear to have any good spots.  when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this, i thought, this has to be good.  i had just finished a movie where he starred.  can't remember the name of it.  i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it.  tori spelling is well known, but not to me.  someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start.  she does not play a flake very well, and i don't know what to call her except a flake.  i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot, but with tori spelling as one of the leads, i already know this one does not have a prayer.  i would say; save your money on this one unless you are under 13.  i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that don't.  this one falls into this category. one that came with this one was "the broken hearts club" and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage.  +dvd
Dan Hedaya's best work in years!+P+Dan Hedaya gives an Oscar worthy performance+dvd
Walk softly, carry a big stick, and have Johnny Knoxville as backup+P+Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).     This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.    Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness. The laugh he uses (I don't know if that's his real laugh) when he and Chris are watching television is just plain out infectious.   Basically, this little actioner, the Rock's follow up to the superior The Rundown, doesn't have anything new to say. It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time. It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.  It gets 3 and a half stars from me.+dvd
Exactly what I was looking for.+P+I was looking for a home work out so I could reclaim a shapely figure without expensive equipment or endless reps. This is it. The lower body work out requires a step and a chair. For the uppper body work out you will need a few small dumbbells and a pillow. Not expensive equipment at all. The exercises are very effective and Kathy gives clear directions and alternate moves for beginners. (like me+dvd
Fellini - Outstanding human nature analyst+P+Fellini's movies are exactly what the human kind has to see before placing itself in a specific age.  It has been never seen before such a transparent, exceptionally artistic and in the same time full of pation and fun human nature analyse.  One of the best movies that still has a full reach of flavour after so many years from the debut.+dvd
CANDYMAN, CANDYMAN, CANDYMAN DELIVERS!!!!!!!+P+Candyman is a untique boogeymen and the story is great and all i have to say is to not go to a mirror and say his name five times..... Candyman is about a mythical guy that was ridcule by a bunch of towns people and they pour honey all over him and watch him get stung to death by bees.... The reason why the towns people did this was he fell in love with a woman.... The candyman is a great horror flick and its great to watch over and over again!!!!!!+dvd
Good Good film+P+It's not a movie for those who hate to see sex on screen and this is certainly not porn but art to the highest degree,scenes of actual penetration and oral sex are such that they seem to draw you into the artist lear that is Ken PaRk.  The plot is solid enough without being staid,the acting is good .   I found this absolutely easy to watch simply because this is reality ....reality onscreen for once...passion is here,sex is hear, nudity is hear...trust and love is here for all to see.    This is film making as it should be;giving the view a film where they have to see it a few times to come to grips with it's sheer uniqueness.   I recommend this.  +dvd
How are people rating this 5 stars+N+I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good. +dvd
deep focus+P+I've taught this film in colleges for thirty-plus years.  Even back at the earliest screenings, traditional-aged freshmen had trouble with it (a) because it was in b&w, and (b) because the dimensional characters didn't telegraph plot advancement but instead used irony, wit, or assumptions that would later be proven wrong by subsequent events.   The first of these objections stunned me when they couldn't appreciate Gene Tierney descending the stairs to seduce "Larry" in a gown relegated to grays.  The second objection (young auduence confusion) just made me sad about the impact of television ... but you already know that story. As with Hollywood's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, released in during the same general period, I personally appreciate the "epic scope" of the narrative, enhanced by remarkable set direction detail.  And I appreciate even more the depth-of-focus photography in both of these films, which enriches viewing by sharp images at several planes of action within the frame.  It's a story well-told at the visual level. I've read complaints about Tyrone Power's "dated" acting in this performance, NIGHTMARE ALLEY, etc.  But again, I suspect this is from a generation more comfortable with MTV editing than with theatre as an entertainment criterion.  Power is given a series of difficult monologues to recite about uncinematic spiritual/ philosophical themes, and he pulls each off brilliantly.  As with Olivier's opening scene in RICHARD III, it's interesting to watch how these monologues have been directed to use a pacing movement of the actor within the frame as a "paragraphing" punctuation.  The lengthy, uninterrupted takes and consequent fluidity of camera movement within these shots not only enhances the impact of the monologues but also makes sly commentary on characters/ themes as continuous camera includes other characters in medium close-ups. Herbert Marshall's Maugham is interesting and underplayed almost as masterfully as Cedrick Hardwicke's performance of "goodness personified" in ROPE.  The close-ups of "Maugham's" eyes to communicate ironic plot points may seem obtrusive, but they're true to Maugham's voice in the novel.   Further, they emphasize the ill-advised decision to omit this narrator's perspective in Murray's hapless remake.  That later film fails in no small part because the female characters are virtually indistinguishable visually, and because the studio (which only made the film to entice Murray to make GHOSTBUSTERS II) invested no interest in producing a good movie script.  Pity, since Murray could have done okay. Two less successful scenes in the 40s version are the "Baby!" hospital melodrama and the ashram Jehovah sequences (not including the remarkably visual spiritual moment in the mountains).  But the supporting cast remains superb throughout--especially the bracing comedy of Webb and Lancaster, and the moving subtlety of John Payne and Lucille Watson.   Tierney's richest moments are linked to the plot:  "That's all right, Larry.  It might be less than a year"; the wedding announcement over the phone; the camera-narrated scene where Isabel "seduces" Larry's fiancee; and, of course, the climax with Larry at the end.  And, by the way, she's as gorgeous as Tyrone Power!   How much more value can one expect from an entertainment that succeeds so well with complex, mature themes of spiritual redemption in a society of capitalist myopia?+dvd
Frighteningly Good+P+Being a big fan of horror and scray movies I consider this movie to be a success. As it succeeded in doing what it intended, it scared the crap out of me. I would say it is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen, those Japanese sure know how to scare people. The storyline is actually quite good too, and while the acting isn't quite inspirational, it is quite good by all involved. The movie making is of a high quality and all up, this is a very good movie, well worth buying and watching over again+dvd
Lame+N+I am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.   The acting was terrible, elements of the story were changed (I know, it can't be 100% true to the book, but this was a massacre), and the characters were ruined (c'mon, they made the movie version Mr. Tumnus seem just a tad bit...um...creepy). They turned Aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion.   Seriously, go read the books and don't waste your time on this film.+dvd
Don't waste your time purchasing this product.+N+I didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.   I have many of her videos and I'm a true fan of hers+dvd
Beware 25 years old does not mean it is tame for kids+N+I purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since Gone with the Wind.  Give me a break!  This movie had an agenda 25 years ago, and it still comes across that way in 2006.  The rating of PG is a joke.  Please do not watch this movie with your kids!  It is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think.  The plot is lame and I am sorry I spent the money on it.  I plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where I can get something that is entertaining, this certainly was not.  I did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off.  For top names in the industry making this film, all I can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing. +dvd
Thank You reviewers+N+I would like to thank all of you here for alerting me (us) to the fact that these episodes are not in their original state and not in order. I love B&B, however, the more I love something the more I INSIST it is an original. Will pass until a release with integrity comes along+dvd
Possibly one of the worst movies ever+N+There is nothing redeeming about this movie. No. I'm sorry. There's no negotiating with that. I don't care if I come back and see "0 of 2,000 people have found this review helpful" I won't change my opinion. This movie is just flat out BAD! Why is it so bad? I could write a book on it, but I can sum it all up by simply saying it is your typical disaster film. It follows every single cliche in the book. And I don't mean fun cliche like horror movies, I mean like you know what's going to happen the entire movie five minutes in.   1. Natural disaster of ludicrous proportions hits America. No other nation is affected, of course, or if they are only to a slight degree. 2. Government leaders go, "OMFG WTF?" and try to prevent it. Initial destruction is prevented by blocking up the storyline with subplots. 3. Some cockamany idea to stop the disaster is attempted. It works... 4. ...for about five seconds. Then real disaster hits and millions die. Let's think seriously here: how many mega natural disasters have befallen major American cities? Like serious disasters? I can think of two: San Francisco in the early 1900's and recently New Orleans. Yet somehow in movies when a natural disaster hits, it ALWAYS hits a highly populated area.  There's loads more cliches - hell, a section in Part Two concerning people escaping a destroyed casino is basically a thirty minute "Poseidon's Adventure." With such ingenuity, you wouldn't expect too much character development, would you? I hope not, because this movie has the most typical assortment of characters you'll ever find:  * The government official who tells other characters what's going on and shoots people worried looks. * The typical government leader (in this case, the president) who mostly does yelling and pity-playing  * The feisty, independent daughter who has a coming of age moment - and who by the way, happens to be the president's daughter and happens to get her father to ask the Secret Service to leave her alone. Um...the president doesn't even have the power to tell the Secret Service to leave HIM alone. * The wife trapped in a building who turns out to be pregnant. * The two brothers who hate each other but learn to cope with one another before one of them dies. * The guy who yells "I'm getting out of here!" and gets killed upon trying to escape. * The worry-wort girl who is told "You'll make it out of here" only to die two minutes later. * The stubborn old folks who refuse to leave their home, even with immenant death and destruction headed their way. Why? "This is our home!" Your suburban house in Houston? PLEASE! Unless you're living on freggin' Indian burial grounds, don't tell me your small patch of turf is worth getting yourself killed for.  You're supposed to care for these people. You're supposed to feel bad when they die. But since they're the same cookie-cutter characters you've seen a hundred times in a hundred different disaster movies, you really don't care.   But let me get to my biggest beef with this movie...WHO THE HECK DIRECTED THIS?! Lemme check IMDB...John Lafia? Hey John - DON'T EVER DIRECT AGAIN! Or if you do, here's a little advice - KEEP YOUR DAMN CAMERA STILL! Every single shot is either shaky cam or zooms. Yes, zoom. Zoom in. Zoom out. Zoom in. Zoom out. Every single shot. Doesn't matter the mood, tone, or action. Zoom in. Zoom out. It's like they didn't plan out any of the scenes and the camera man had to correct every shot. This gets old in about five minutes. No, actually, it got old in ten seconds. And considering this is a two-part miniseries, about an hour and a half long each, it's enough to have someone commit suicide.  Is this movie good? No, because I've seen it already. I saw it when it was called "Deep Impact." I sall it when it was called "Armaggedon." I saw it when it was "Dante's Peak." I saw it when it was "Volcano." I saw it when it was "Asteroid." I saw it when it was...ARG!! My apologies for the bitter review, but this movie really tried my patience. I cannot understand how there are people out there that like this. I suppose there is a secret cult of self-mutilating masochists out there who enjoy punishing themselves by watching bad movies for their own sick, evil amusement. Then again, perhaps I hate and love this movie as much as I hate and love myself..+dvd
Delightfully funny.+P+This movie was both entertaining and at times, hilarious.  Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.  Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend.  This movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor.  I highly recommend it.+dvd
lacked some heart+P+This was a good action flick but I felt that there was nobody encouraging eachother on the SWAT team or anybody doing anything or saying anything with heart.  The film was one of the best action films out there though and I did like the scene where the young swat memebers are training to be on the team.  The end of the movie is pretty cool and Samuel L. Jackson played a great leader for the SWAT team just like he was a great coach on Coach Carter.  When guns or bombs go off the sourround sound is exhilirating.  The commentary was dissapointing though.  Buy it if you like action flicks.  God bless you and America+dvd
Portrait of an Artist as a Young Brazilian+P+We all see different films, even when we see the same film. "City of God" is especially like that, with it's linked stories that give multiple perspectives--not unlike the linked stories used in postmodern novels. "City of God" gives us a story of crime, poverty, drugs, sex, homelessness, corruption, community (in its own way), even odd bits of humor--and a way out.  A Special Feature on this DVD is the documentary "News from a Personal War" which uses the same technique of multiple perspecitves in a brilliant effort to give a rounded view to a complex story of the drug war in Rio.  The movie I see would be titled "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Brazilian" played by Alexandre Rodrigues as Rocket who narrates "City of God." The DVD jacket says it so well: ". . . a frail and scared young boy will grow up to discover that he can view the harsh realities of his surroundings with a different eye: the eye of an artist." I love the moment when his photos are discovered by the newpaper through a mistake and how that leads to Rocket's career as a journalistic photographer--and his first hot shower, followed by his first sexual experience. This last part of the film is thrilling as Rocket moves into a new world and then rockets between them.  Remember the lyrics that had a bouncing ball on top telling you what word to sing next? Just follow the bouncing ball here--the words and story line of the young narrator as his heart's wish comes true and he demonstrates considerable courage.  --Janet Grace Riehl, author "Sightlines: A Poet's Diary+dvd
Not as good, but still watchable...+N+This second sequel to "Darkman" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about "Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die," which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark+dvd
NOT What I Was Hoping For...+N+I had worn out my copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs so I thought I would try something new.  Bad decision.  There are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really don't feel one exercise before you move on to the next.  In addition, you really need to buy the "Firm Sculpting Stick" to make many of the exercises work, which I found insulting and rather marketing-minded.  I am sending this back+dvd
Yet another DVD I got for Christmas!+N+Where my gifter managed to get an original and brand new copy of this one I have no idea, the bottomline is that it is now part of my collection and I am here to say what I think of it.  It could have been improved.  It's major flaw other than the relatively crude animation is the characters, rather unlikeable heroes and hilarious villains that you strongly wish would win in the end since they are more likeable than those known as heroes.  The story doesn't change much from scene to scene, 15 dalmatian puppies have been kidnapped and must find their way home by going from place to place avoiding Cruella DeVil and her henchmen.  Recommended?  Not really, it has it's moments of warmth, but otherwise, it isn't one of Disney's greatest films+dvd
Disney at its best+P+Unfortunately there have been some negative reviews towards this film, which in my opinion is one of Disney's best motion pictures. The art is gorgeous and sets a tone that is lacking in the newest Disney films. Even with the advent of computer generated images and improved techniques for classic animation, the old Disney art presents a certain character and feel that I prefer over the newest animation. I've watched this multiple times with my 2 year old cousin and he enjoys it quite a bit.  It's a classic that follows the tradition of films such as Lady and the Tramp, the Sword in the Stone, and Robin Hood+dvd
Hard to resist due to good performances...+P+I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force. +dvd
Great stretches+P+Only negative so far is that I wish the stretches would each last a little longer.  Otherwise, it's thorough, not too difficult, and Tamilee is very informative, serene, and motivating.  Highly recommend+dvd
The most importand of the disney dvd's+P+I finally got my hands on this dvd and all tha waiting was worth it! The first cartoons to use music and sounds in such variety, the first to introduce a real American middle class man of the time through a cartoon figure. All the way from the other side of the world I still enjoy it...Mickey's best shorts are here!+dvd
Agnostics are smarter than atheists+P+Those who use evolution as proof there is no creator are, in my opinion, narrow minded. Evolution only disagrees with written texts of creationism. One needs to look well beyond.  If I were God I would want my people to be able to neither prove or disprove my existence...yet I would leave some doubts or unanswerable questions for man to ponder...like science that breaks down at the moment of the Big Bang.   Those that study the human body have barely glimpsed the complexities of this evolved life form and I find I have a gnawing feeling about how adaptive evolution alone got us all the way here. A bit of doubt leaves that door to God open, albeit not a god exactly like one's holy book might have posited.   Many great scientists are believers of sorts so I find atheists to be arrogant, and agnostics perhaps closer to the truth. Who knows...if string theory is in fact reality, perhaps God resides only a dimension away+dvd
Dark Hero+P+A down and dirty Mel Gibson is fantastic in this film.  From his gravely voice, and the lack of a single smile throughout the film, he plays the part perfectly.  Porter is a man betrayed by his wife, his friend, and left for dead.  The entire movie involves him trying to get the money that was stolen from him back.  That proves to be not as simple as it seems, and soon corrupt cops, the mob, and Japanese gangsters are all out for him.  This one is worth the money+dvd
Perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull+N+Joel Hershman's "Greenfingers", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy.  In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening.  Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden.  But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?  Of course, this being a "romantic comedy" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed "uplifting moments".  And none of it works.  For all its good intentions, "Greenfingers" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates' rooms. It's all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull+dvd
One Star For Violence--Five Stars For Heroism+N+I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol+dvd
A Big Waste Of Time!!!!+N+I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder+dvd
MUST HAVE for Fans of Bible Stories on DVD! SAVE $$$ While Building Your Library!+P+I bought all of these 6 DVDs separately because I did not know that they came as a set, at a better price! I paid about $15 each, about $90 total, and I do not regret owning them all, but I would have jumped on this set if I had known about it!  Most of these DVDs are very interesting and faithful to Scripture. SAMSON & DELILAH is the weakest of these 6 DVDs, as it spends too much time on non-scriptural characters. ABRAHAM covers many scenes of the 40 year wandering rarely seen on DVD. JACOB is pretty close to Scripture. JOSEPH is great, but it spends a bit too much time rewriting the narration to allow for Ben Kingsley's Potiphar role to expand. I have not yet watched DAVID, but I look forward to Leonard Nimoy's appearance in the film.  Most of these films are 3 hours long, presumably they were mostly all short mini-series when they originally ran on TV. I think only JACOB is about 90 minutes, of the 6 DVDs in this set. You can read about each DVD as they are all sold separately on amazon.com.  All of these 6 DVDs have major TV network, made-for-TV quality, and I am quite surprised and pleased that these movies are so good. I do not know of any better series of Bible stories on DVD.  There is another Box Set available, THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which has 3 other DVDs of this series of movies. JEREMIAH is my favorite of all 9 movies. ESTHER is great, and perhaps the most faithful to Scriptural accuracy and chronology of all 9 movies. SOLOMON is the only 3 hour DVD in this smaller Box Set. There is a GENESIS in this Box Set, but it is not a dramatized movie, just a narration of the book of Genesis, while modern day nomads are shown going about their daily routine. GENESIS is a disappointment and very UNLIKE the other 9 movies, so much so that it doesn't even seem to be part of the same production series.  Bottom Line: I highly recommend that anybody buy both of these box sets, and they will save about 50% over buying each DVD separately! Praise the LORD+dvd
Laura, A Name to be Remembered!+P+I first saw Laura as a young woman, but I had not seen it for many years.  However, the aura of Laura remained with me through those years.  I decided to buy it after I had seen a screening of it.  I was reminded of why I liked it so much.  The stars are real and convincing.  Gene Tierney was beautiful as the mysterious Laura.  Dana Andrews was handsome and to my present-day eyes, very convincing as the astute detective McPherson.  Vincent Price is a real charmer as the erstwhile fiance Shelby.  Clifton Webb is charming as he always was as Waldo.  Otto Preminger was a wonderful director and kept the story tight and convincing with all of his characters.  The scenery was limited and tightly held.  I was particularly intrigued by the rain; it rained constantly, and some of the most interesting dialogue occurred during the various rainstorms.  Laura has become my most watched DVD because I'm constantly seeing little things that I missed before.  In addition, I adore the apartments of Laura and Waldo because they were decorated then pretty much as I want to decorate now.  Waldo's bathroom is to die for.  Incidentally, I watch the extended version because I love looking at Gene Tierney's wardrobe.  +dvd
Not my cup of tea+N+I rented this movie because I like Luke Wilson and I was in the mood for a romantic comedy, but I was very disappointed. There's just about no chemistry between Wilson and Kate Hudson, and she was just terrible. Throughout the entire movie, I could practically see the acting wheels turning in her head--her portrayal as a somewhat prudish, somewhat mousy character was both unnatural and incredibly annoying. If not for her bad acting, I would have given this movie a higher rating, because it did have its funny and some sweet moments (if you can ignore the implausible plot). There just wasn't enough "good" to compete with Hudson's "bad.+dvd
Strong buy+P+I really like the story and this film brings you back to the last century and the ambiance of these times. Colin Firth is fantastic in this role!+dvd
"Always Be Closing!"+P+Glengarry Glen Ross is a superb drama directed by James Foley (At Close Range), and starring a powerful all-male cast including Al Pacino (Heat), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator), and Jonathon Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl).  The movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by David Mamet, who also helms the screenplay to the movie version. The thing that drew me most to Glengarry Glen Ross was the dialogue. And since I tried my hand at door-to-door sales, I felt very connected to the characters in the movie, especially Sheldon Levene, played remarkably by Lemmon. The presentation made by Alec Baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist.  The movie is not just for salesmen (even though I find it mandatory for anybody who's considering a career in sales), but for everybody who appreciates real movies.  Recommended  +dvd
Really Really Really Bad+N+Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible+dvd
over rated underwriten and over acted+N+well i bought this series agaisnst the star rating it has and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is badly written the acting is ham,and the actors of a standard that do not rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do not mean they score higher than ten. i cannot understand its  five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it should never have got passed the pilot.if i could i would rate it 0 stars.if there is a secound series i will not be buying it. +dvd
Crazy Movie!+P+This was such a weird and crazy movie! But it had it's appeal that I liked and because of that, I ended up buying it. It's a beauty pageant gone outer limits the ugly and crazy side that's pretty fun to watch...weird? The movie really doesn't make sense...maybe I don't want it to make sense. It's probably safer that way. ;) lo+dvd
The Best Workout - EVER!+P+I love the Firm workout tapes.  I used them before my wedding trying to get fit.  They really do work in 10 workouts or less!  Once I had my baby, I started using them again, and with no doubt, they worked!  This is the only workout that I really enjoy, I don't have to work out for 2 or 3 hours to get the effective results.  I think about this workout when I'm not doing it, and I really enjoy it!  I recommend this and any other tapes from the series to anyone.  Trust me, you just put in the work, and the workouts do the rest!  They're not easy, but they are effective+dvd
"Be Nice.. Until It's Time To Not Be Nice."  ("Road House:"  Special Edition)+P+It's been said before (and over and over in all the reviews here, so I won't bore you with the details why it's been said) but I'll say it again:  "Roadhouse" is a great bad movie!  I do find it funny that this one has earned that type of fond recollection by so many and turned into a cult hit of sorts because of it; while there are literally tons of these type of movies that littered the action/adventure landscape throughout the 80s and early 90s.  Hardly any of them are even remembered much less revered to the extent "Roadhouse" is.  I guess it's just one of those things.  Maybe its because the movie has (at the time) bigger stars, a bigger budget and a larger abundance of gratuitous T&A than most theatrically released action flicks that bare a general resemblance to it (of course, you could find plenty of this type of thing lining the walls of your local Blockbuster, but even though they supply the action and nudity, they don't often supply the big stars and big budgets).  Maybe it was just a matter of right place, right time, right amount of exposure, etc.    Who knows; but whatever the reason, I'm glad enough this film has endured.    This special edition does its legacy as a winking-joke-unto-itself proud (Swayze's character is known as "the best bouncer in the business."  Where was the annual bouncer convention of  '89 held and how is the winner of that title determined?).  The best reason to pick this up instead of the previous, bare-bones DVD transfer is the commentary tracks.  The first is by the film's director, Rowdy Herrington, which is actually rather informative considering the source material being examined.  But the real treat is the other commentary track by director and professional fanboy Kevin Smith and his production partner Scott Mossier.  Not only is it a great commentary, but the very idea that the producers of this DVD saw it appropriate to include a commentary from someone who has nothing to do with making this movie shows that all involved are in on the joke.  They should have just gone the full nine and held contest to find the ultimate, die hard "Roadhouse" fan and let him/her do the commentary.  And I'd be willing to bet, somewhere, Quentin Tarrentino is pissed he didn't get a call (he loves contributing his two cents to cult films that he has nothing to do with other than being  either a huge fan or hating the movie's guts - either way, always an entertaining commentator).    Now if only studio execs would get off their butts and release perhaps the only junk-action movie more loved and clamored for than this one:  "Stone Cold."  (It feels like that is the only movie ever made that has not made it to DVD, yet everyone seems to want it to be released, so what gives?!  Since when aren't studios egger to cash in???)  Give us a "Stone Cold" special edition and slap it in a two-pack with this classic and you'll have all the craptacular entertainment this side of the old school Steven Seagal flicks you'll ever need.+dvd
Promising Debut+P+Small town America... only this isn't the pleasant and white-picketed small town America of film noir fame, it's the gray and colorless small town America of neo-noir, and there's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it.  A bum who's being approached by that famous "Man in a Black Trenchcoat"...  Hard Eight (AKA Sydney, but I've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title) is a debut pretty much as promising as Blood Simple to the brothers Coen.  Paul Thomas Anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best, with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want (or expect) them to do, but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout.  Anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect, allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir.  That said, Anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies, and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies, he focuses most of his time on the characters' faces, and just lets them be.  If he hadn't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I'd say that this is a "promising debut that makes me impatient for the next Anderson picture to come out," but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt, I must say, "See this to see Anderson at his roots," and "Man I can't wait for his next feature!"  --PolarisDi+dvd
earlier is better+P+this is one of VanDamnes earlier movies---and one of his better ones-----the story line is fair and his acting is goo+dvd
If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, then you may like this+N+This is your standard, generic, run-of-the mill comedy, with Ben Stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc. and Jennifer Anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible.  Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.  If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, "oh, that was supposed to be funny", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?  Are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them, and they act like a complete loon?  I mean, come on.  This crap was old when they were doing it on the Carol Burnett Show 30 years ago.   Anyhow, if you're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight, brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time, then you'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else. It's probably better than reruns on the Cooking Channel, but only by the slimmest of margins+dvd
RIP-OFF REMEMBRANCE+N+I know the title of this volume of Wolf's Rain is "Recollections", but Bandai has went a little overboard. I expect at least one or two episodes in an anime series to be a recap but here we have an ENTIRE DVD, 4 EPISODES of recycled material from past shows!!!! There is nothing new here. Even the infamous last 2 episodes of Evangelion didn't go so far as this and they were running out of money. What is the excuse here? To pay 20$ for an entire dvd of stuff I've already seen. It's almost like they were making one of those awful anime movies where an entire 26 episode series is squeezed into 2 hours. There should have been a warning on the dvd box that there is no new material contained in it. It makes me want to write to Bandai and demand my money back. If you have been following Wolf's Rain since the first volume, definately skip this volume. You'll be wasting your money.    I would recommend Miami Guns Episode 2, which parodies recap shows by having one after only one episode of the show.+dvd
Would not recommend+N+I own several Real Wheels movies and thought I would give this one a shot.  I found the picture quality to be less than I expected and the footage seemed out of date.  The narration was dull and boring, and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying.  I would recommend any of the  Real Wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover+dvd

Definitive portrayal of generation X (for what that's worth)+N+Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.   +dvd
Bee boop, boring!- Not for Cardio Lovers+N+Searching through the Amazon FIRM DVD's, Lo and behold! New ones! I was very excited to get this. Once the DVD arrived, I rushed to play it. It started with a "boogie/hip hop" kind of warm-up.... and kind of STAYED there. It just lacked any intensity. Now, there was some latin dancing, some disco dancing, and a boogie/hip hop cool down, but nothing to break a sweat with.   I would recommend this for someone who is just beginning to work out, or someone out of shape.I was really disappointed, because it was hosted by Allie DelRio, in my humble opinion the best of the best. Her smile was wonderful, following her was easy, but it just lacked that FIRM energy. Plus, the workout cast had only Allie and Allison. The other folks were people never before seen in FIRM videos. One lady in the back even did these mini-dip twist things with her knees over her toe box! (A HUGE no-no)   Recently, Goodtimes video, the company who used to own the FIRM, was just purchased by Gaiam (The folks behind AM/PM yoga). If this is what they are doing to the FIRM, I am going to stick with the old ones I got. I sure hope not-As the owner of 30 FIRM workouts, I am used to quality and excellence with the FIRM+dvd
Trouble Aplenty in a Parallel World+P+Here we have another parody of the giant robot anime genre (mostly making fun of Evangelion). The basic plot is that a teenage guy sees giant city-smashing robots where no one else does, a mad scientist is convinced that this is evidence of a parallel universe, and the mad scientist sends the guy (along with the mad scientist's daughter) to the parallel universe where (surprise) the guy gets to pilot the giant robots.  This series doesn't take itself too seriously, or try to get into the deeper questions of the meaning of life or anything, but instead tries to tell a simple adventure story (in the format of the typical teen-age guy gets chased around by every girl in sight) of a boy and his giant mecha. The show is only 13 episodes long, but this length suits it well, as to make the series go on longer would just reduce half of the show to filler. The 13 episode format keeps things tight. As far as pioneer animation shows go, this is one of the better ones (my favorite still being Battle Athletes Victory). The animation and character designs are good, and the CGI and traditional animation melds well (for the most part). The action sequences aren't really mind-blowing (except perhaps for some of the early ones in the show {like the one where our protagonist jumps into a fallen Mecha and saves its pilot by destroying the enemy attacking her}).  The music isn't too bad, except for when it's not there (maybe it's supposed to be dramatic or atmospheric, but a few times I found myself getting bored). The characters are all pretty likable (and especially the alternate Mitsaki, one of the nicest, cutest, sweetest, most attractive girls in all of anime), and some of the dialog and situations are pretty funny (although on the whole I'd say that the comedy was largely hit-and-miss).  If you're a fan of Mecha, and particularly Mecha comedies, you should probably give this one a rent at the least. If you like its style it's probably worth a purchase.+dvd
The worst movie ever+N+My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... hel+dvd
Movie should include noose+N+American Pie: an immature, mindless, vapid, boring, blandly disgusting, humor lacking piece of over-rated trash packed full of cliches, highschool sterotypes, annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade A douchebags.+dvd
Sadly,+N+The lack of Liam neeson and raimi's directing is what ruined this movie for me. While Mr. Vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the Liam created character and mr. Drake always has appeal, the movie as a whole needed a much better script. It was too predicatble, too phoney. On the bonus side, they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments Darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact, so that was a plus+dvd
Stargate SG-1 Season 9 DVDs+N+As a long fan of Stargate SG-1, why wait so long for Season 9 to be released only for short segments to have been removed from the episodes?  Are the customers being sold future syndicated versions of these episodes?  I must say, I'm not pleased.  MGM, Sony, Fox and Amazon, what's up+dvd
Amazon does not really carry this item+N+I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.

This is not my beautiful house . . .+P+Think A CHRISTMAS CARROL with a modern-day twist to it and you've got FAMILY MAN. A tale of a man who chose buisness over pleasure. When told that he would get a higher-paying job out in the big city, he agreed to fly over there and take it . . . leaving his girlfriend behind who wanted to marry him really badly. He promised that he would come back and everything but never did. Now, a few years later, he is the rich and fancy buisness man that he always wanted to be.

Poor Release of Movie+N+I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin+dvd
Loose Cannon+P+The documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s!   I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun.    They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill.   The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him.   Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) "sports entertainer" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in.   Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together.   Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal.   Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.+dvd
The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter+N+The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though+dvd

What's all the fuss about?+N+Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.  There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.  The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.  The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.  In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex+dvd
IGNORANT+N+I dont want to see these yuppie kids on this ignorant TV show. This is crap. How can you stand to watch this garbage+dvd
Style WAY, WAY, WAY Over Substance+N+I'm a fan of the 1999 "The Mummy" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.    It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and "The Mummy Returns" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.    "The Mummy Returns" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. "The Mummy Returns" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.  FINAL ANALYSIS: "The Mummy Returns" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.   Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. "Returns" put an end to that.  +dvd
Between "Heaven" and Hell+P+The brilliant director of "Run Lola Run" and "The Princess and the Warrior", Tom Tykwer, has directed another visually stunning, thought provoking and mystical film exploring the relationship of a man and a woman from different backgrounds who find each other and realize that a strong and potent connection exists between the two of them. As in "The Princess and the Warrior," Tykwer combines the real and the surreal to dazzling effect.  The main characters, whose names are "Phillipa" and "Fillipo" represent opposite or opposing forces who finally become merged into one. "Phillipa" the female character, circumvents and subverts society's ineffectual system of laws by taking the law into her own hands, and plans to kill a drug dealer who is in cahoots with the the police. "Fillipo", the male character, is in direct contradistinction to Phillipa in that he is a member of the police system that Phillipa feels has failed her, her husband, and her students (she is a teacher). After she is captured, the two find a powerful spiritual connection that transforms and bonds them forever. The roles that were established for the characters blur as Fillipo breaks the laws his job symbolizes and helps Phillipa escape; and Phillipa, racked with guilt over the the inncoent deaths at her hands, is ready to submit to the very same laws that failed her and set all the events in motion. The film, as it progresses, reconciles these opposing forces, and the characters' identities and ideals literally (they begin to look alike) and symbollically (they begin to both believe that there is no real justice in the world) merge into one.  The film, in addition, grows more surreal as it progresses and the bond between the two is cemented both physically and spiritually. Some critics have expressed that the ending is disappointing in the way it leaves the moral aspects of the film unresolved (Phillipa escapes punishment for her crimes). I think they have missed the point in that the main focus of the film, as in most of Tykwer's films, is on the mystical connection of the characters. The last scene, a breathtaking piece of cinema, establishes this connection in a surreal way. Phillipa herself admits that she deserves punishment for her crimes, but in a world that makes no sense, where justice and law rarely live up to their ideals, their last escape makes perfect sense+dvd
Here's the awful truth+N+This is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy, pre-packaged beliefs. Sure, this series bears some [contrived] humor; How convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some regressive conservative who, with a red face, watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur Michael Moore because of his fabricated "misrepresentations and untruths." I guess I'm writing this because I had the misfortune of seeing "The Awful Truth," and I feel I need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until I have an aneurysm. (If I had an aneurysm, I'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the Shamu tank at Sea World. At least I could warp some kids' minds in the process of dying.)  Every episode is literally like, "AWFUL FACT OF THE DAY: Some obscure, skewed study shows that Americans are dumb and like explosions and I'm Michael Moore an attention-starved clownboat!" Seriously, it's interesting Moore critiques "American Indulgence" when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright. - Thus Says the Pellingto+dvd
* Are We Living in a True Democracy? *+P+I ask the question and ask that people open themselves up to the possiblity that some elections in the past have been stolen.  I'm not picking on either Republicans or Democrats as I'm sure both sides have their shady dealings.  I do believe that the information on this documentary as well as Noam Chomsky's documentaries and Gore Vidal's books are very telling.  I question whether democracy is alive anymore and if it is too late in our life times to correct this.    A stunning view of a behind the scenes look at the 2000 presidential election.  Much of the info in this documentary was not on the major news networks ... hmmm, I wonder why+dvd
More proaganda than documentary+N+Bottom line... 1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa. 2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.   3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish "GORE from BUSH".  Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right. +dvd
Formulaic, but watchable.+N+Paparazzi (Paul Abascal, 2004)  Paparazzi is best known for being Icon Production's first released film after the mighty (and mightily money-making) majesty that was The Passion of the Christ. The Icon connection, however, is where any similarity between the two films comes to an abrupt and jarring end. Where Passion pushed all sorts of envelopes for mainstream American film, Paparazzi is simple and formulaic, never rearing its ugly head from the morass of revenge fantasy in which it finds itself bogged.  Bo Laramie (Pitch Black's Cole Hauser, looking and acting more and more like his dad by the day) has gone overnight from nobody to superstar thanks to his film Adrenaline Force. Subsequently, he's packed up his family and moved to the suburbs of LA to be closer to the set for his new picture (predictably, Adrenaline Force 2). Along with the closeness of the commute, however, comes the mobs of paparazzi. Laramie runs afoul of photojournalist Rex Harper (the always-slimy Tom Sizemore), who convinces three of his friends to help him put Laramie in his place. In doing so, however, they inadvertently cause an accident that lands both Laramie's wife (The Craft temptress Robin Tunney) and son (Jurassic Park III's Blake Michael Bryan) in the hospital. Cue revenge-fantasy music here.  The film is watchable, as one would normally expect from this sort of action film. The roles are acted capably enough, though two-dimensionally; it's almost as if Hauser, who's made his living mostly playing guys like Rex Harper, only knows how to play the hero as a square-jawed Tarzan type. That's not surprising in an action flick, though, and can be forgiven most times (look at Predator 2). Where the film becomes moronic to the point of offensive, though, is in the accident scene itself, which is so obviously ripped off from tales of Princess Diana's death as to be insulting to the intelligence of the average viewer. *+dvd
Tootsie+P+"Tootsie" holds a place on both The American Film Institute's Top 100 Movies (#62) and The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#2). Oddly enough, on the latter list it's directly below "Some Like it Hot" and both films have simalar subjects. Ironically, both subjects are some of the most stereotypical ones. Comedies come out every year involving men dressing as women for some purpose; Only some films pull it off with dignity and real heartfelt humor, though, which is why I think Tootsie is so popular. Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman, in a wonderful performance) is a down on his luck actor. He's been living in New York City trying to make it for twenty years and nothing's happening. One day his agent (played by the films director Sydney Pollack) explains to Michael that no one wants to work with him. Taking matters into his own hands, Michael dresses as a woman and adapts a higher voice and becomes Dorothy Michaels; Michael, under his new guise, auditions for a soap opera and wins the role...And acclaim. At the same time, he falls in love with Julie (Jessica Lange, who won an Oscar for the role) who is dating the director (Dabney Coleman). Meanwhile, Michael manages to neglect a potential girlfriend (Teri Garr) and freak out his roommate Jeff (Bill Murray, who's hilarious as always). In retrospect, you've seen this film thousands of times...While I wasn't alive the year the film came out, I can't say this is the originator of this storyline, but it is one of the best films to evolve from that storyline. Dustin Hoffman, who is almost always good, is great in the dual role (although his five o'clock shadow can be seen under the makeup in several scenes). Lange is beautiful and wonderful in the role. This is a great movie, if you haven't seen it...Well...See it.  GRADE: +dvd
EVIL DEAD is a gorehound delite!+P+It's hard to imagine this was Sam Raimi's first entry into films, considering his more tame offerings such as Spider-Man, which is a good movie by the way, even if it doesn't feature any gore.  Are you looking for a bath of gory fun? This is the movie that MUST be in your collection if you are a blood hound like myself. Ash is at his weakest in this version of the series, but this is how he gets started. The cast is much different than that of Evil Dead 2, and by far, this film is MUCH gorier, as preferred. How gory? How about spilling buckets of blood, bodily dismemberment and loads of gut chopping. Wonderful horror film without any limitations on the gore. And I thought Braindead was gory, ha+dvd
Thoroughly Entertaining+P+This is a really good movie with an excellent excellent screenplay. The movie begins with the birth of punk, when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the Sex Pistols when they first came out, changing the course of music, and ends with the death of acid. As Tony Wilson puts it in the film, it is the "story of Manchester," that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw London and its record companies and start producing their own records out of Manchester, and boy, has music history benefited from this decision. It's interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in Manchester began to age, they become less idealistic as they were in their youth, and more acknowledging of reality and its limits. My only complaint is that I wish the movie could have had more on Joy Division and New Order, than on the Happy Mondays. Why did Tony Wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in Manchester's Battle of the Bands??? The casting for this movie is outstanding, as well.  Two big thumbs up.  P.S. I don't know why they used the cover that they did for the DVD. It really has nothing to do with the film+dvd
Bad+N+I must say the positive reviews here fooled me. I expected much more fun. I would have loved a real blend of soap opera and (even cheap) fantastique. But this doesn't even make the grade as 'so bad it's good' fun, at least for me. Well, maybe the first episode, but the second is just very boring. Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies.  The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess. I guess they didn't have much time to shoot this but overall it's just not worth your time.  +dvd
Boring+N+This is a one-time watch. It is most definately a home movie with very unprofessional editing. I was hoping for at least one or two songs to have a professional mix. Never happened..+dvd
THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACTED BETTER IF THEY USED REAL RETARDS!!!!!!!+N+I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling "1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
Realistic, Yet Hopeless War Story.+P+Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.  Despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)+dvd
Did I miss something?+N+I saw this movie about 20 years ago when it was on Cinemax. I fell asleep while watching it then. I bought the DVD as part of the Controversial Classics set, and was looking forward to seeing the parts I missed.   This time, I fell asleep twice watching it; it took a total of three nights to see it all. I found it just as talky and heavy-handed as I did when I saw it back in college. Further, I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the leads, and found James Coburn's character loud and annoying. Finally, the great MGM hairstylist Sidney Guillaroff was way off the mark on this one. Almost all of the women had mid-60's hairdo's that were distracting, particularly Miss Andrews, whose distracting poofie 'do often changed from shot to shot within the same scene.  I get it; war is bad. Nevertheless, this film did little for me. It did, however, look very nice; the DVD transfer was well done+dvd
Excellent, easy, energizing practices+P+I LOVE these practices! They go so well with the longer Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. The A.M practice is my particular favorite, it really gets me going, I do it almost everyday, in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon. If I'm particulary rushed, I might repeat the A.M. practice, I like it so much. The P.M is pretty good, too; I get to sleep quicker when I do it.+dvd
Awww...+P+This movie is incredible. It has a great way of deminstating how judgemental people that shouldn't be judgemental are. This movie catches your heart and you get wrapped up in it. 5 STARS for sure. Its was an incredible movi+dvd
Best movie I have seen in a very long time+P+I feel this movie should be seen by all. It's awesome, and really makes you think. You get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling. I highly recommend it! Awesome movie+dvd
Not too good even with beautiful Sandra+N+I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a "good show".  The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.  There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief+dvd
Davy Crockett+P+If you grew up as a Davy Crockett fan in the 50's, this is it, the real thing!  You'll want t o get out your coonskin hat and wear it for the movie+dvd
Warning! Spoiler: The irony of the Disney world view+N+Disney does it again! They manage to turn two beautiful, compelling books into a story of squabbling American adolescents. I find it supremely ironic that Disney felt it necessary to turn a murderous troop of Marxist guerrillas into a murderous, greedy mining agent - this from one of the most devouring, money-hungry corporations in the history of capitalism! Did they perhaps believe that depicting a troop of black soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family wouldn't be as politically correct (or as comprehensible to a pre-teen or early teen audience) as showing a greedy white mining agent ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family? Of course, Francois Joubert simply has to be transformed into the obnoxious Harry Winslow (to make the movie more appealing to an American audience). And must every story involving young people of opposite sexes be turned into a "Girls are stupid! - Boys are stupider! - I love you! - I love you too!" tale of teenage battle of the sexes turned to love? It's been many years since I read the novels, but I don't remember that particular twist to the story, perhaps because Van der Post wasn't necessarily writing for the 11-14-year-old American market. If you're at all disenchanted with the world as Mickey sees (and sanitizes) it, skip the movie and read the books ("A Story Like the Wind" and "A Far Off Place")+dvd
Another over rated movie+N+Please do not compare this with Clock Work Orange. It's shame. This movie is shame on director. Cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good. This movie is like B grade stuff.   Plot is good, but not the direction or screen play+dvd
Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?+N+OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics+dvd
Words can't do justice+P+For me, this film was about Matt Damon, a brilliant newcomer who came out of (seemingly) nowhere. I was floored by his performance - one of the best of the 20th century. Of course he was supported by a fine cast -  Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and the loveable Minnie Driver, whose onscreen chemistry with Damon was sizzling. Matt is an emerald in a heap of cheap diamonds, and obviously a multi-talented guy - he co-wrote the screenplay as well as starred in it. Well worth seeing. +dvd
It's a right kerfuffle!+P+Little Britain is quite simply the funniest comedy out there today.  I laughed till I cried.  These guys are amazing and have created unforgettable characters that you WANT to see again and again, in new surroundings dealing with their same problems, like we all must do.  If you have a strong stomach and a courageous sense of humor, you will love Little Britain+dvd
Gil Gerard is one fine slab of man!+P+Ok, now that I got your attention...   This is a great trip down memory lane for any of you Star Wars nuts that grew up in the late 70s/early 80s. Remembering how things were back in 1979, I can see how this show managed to captivate me. No internet, no video games, no cable, VHS, DVD... not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be. We had nothing else. Even though as an eight year old, I knew this was kinda lame, it was an absolute godsend when there was only one TV in the house with a total of four channels.    Anyhow, stream of consciouness bullet list:   - First season is great cheese and hot chicks, second season is horrid.  - This is what Star Trek would have been if Roddenberry had come around ten years later. - A Gil Gerard (circa 1979) versus William Shatner (circa 1969) stagefight would probably put me into a coma due to it's mind-blowing awesomeness.  - Ahead of even the great Princess Leia and the not-quite-as-great Cassiopia, Colonel Deering and Princess Amadala are the two women who made me realize I was down with the ladies, if you catch my very blatant drift. Nothing surpirsing here, but Erin Gray was my first crush. - Twiki is not nearly as annoying as some stick-in-the-mud types would have you believe. His cheeseball comic relief works perfectly with Gil's cheeseball chest carpet and martial arts ability. - Every scene involving "dancing from the future" or previously referenced martial arts is twenty times more entertaining that anything in the history of "reality TV".  - Hawk is not an interesting character, he is just the least crappy thing in a completely crappy second season.  - There are no extras at all, pretty dissapointing given the price point and the target audience of sci-fi geeks who thrive on that kinda stuff  In conclusion: I miss the days when Sci-Fi didn't have to beat you over the head and then strangle you with nothing but dread and darkness and doom. Buck Rogers takes place in post-apocolyptic, nuclear wasteland, mutants living in the desert, planet Earth... and it's still a hundred times less depressing than any of the cookie cutter sci-fi series plopped out in the last ten years.   Of course, we are a much more critical society nowadays... plumped up on years of cable networks, easily accessible VHS/DVD movies and other competitors for our time. Long gone are the days of shows like this. Shows where everybody involved, audience included, knew it was escapist/fantasy crap but just went along and had fun with it. Gil Gerard is an absolute joy to watch just because you always knew he was in on the joke (at least during the first season). Everybody takes themselves too seriously nowadays, especially Sci-Fi. The new Battlestar series is so painfully self-aware it's basically a soap-opera that happens to be in space.   Anyhoo... If are a male sci-fi fan who was between the ages of let's say... 6 to 12... when this series made it's run, go out and buy it. For better or worse, Buck Rogers took me back to the late 70s much more effectively than Star Wars or Battlestar.   4/5 only due to the complete lack of extra+dvd
sorry I got it+N+could have been a truly interesting film, just plain simpleminded and annoying+dvd
Personal truths and loyalties+N+I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out "Helpful" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.  The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of "Blue Lagoon" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.  I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.  Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that "historical accuracy" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.  One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, "No one dies of sorrow."  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in "Angels in America" says, "The body is the garden of the soul."  Sorrow is worth full attention.  The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply "good" or "bad"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.  Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.  May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.  Compare Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions+dvd
Mickey Spillane IS Mike Hammer+P+Having watched a number of Mike Hammer t.v. shows, I was looking forward to seeing what the author (Mickey Spillane) could bring to his creation. I was not disappointed. I was, in fact, suprised by how well he played Mike  Hammer, and I would definitely recommend this film to fans of all ages. The  only thing that bothered me about the film is the often annoying  soundtrack.  Note: the movie is in widescreen forma+dvd
YES IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TELEVISION.+P+THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MEDICAL SHOWS TO COME AROUND IN A WHILE. AND I AM ACTUALLY LEARNING SOME MEDICAL FACTS FROM THIS SHOW. I LOVE ALL OF THE ACTORS ON THE SHOW ESPECIALLY HUGH LAURIE AND OMAR EPPS. THEY ARE BOTH SO TALENETED! (NOT TO MENTION HOT!) AND THE HUMOR IN THE SHOW IS JUST WONDERFUL. IT REALLY KEEPS THE SHOW INTERESTING. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, DYNAMIC AND WELL DEVELOPED I THINK. THE STORIES ARE ALSO WELL WRITTEN, WELL ACTED, AND WELL DEVELOPED IN MY OPINION. I FIND EACH CASE FASCINATING AND I LOVE TO WATCH AS EACH ONE UNRAVELS. IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT FORMULAIC BUT I FEEL IT'S A FORMULA THAT WORKS! I REALLY ENJOY WATCHING THIS SHOW. I ALMOST ALWAYS LAUGH AT ONE OR MORE OF DR. HOUSE'S ANTICS/JOKES/PRANKS/RUNS AND I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. I THINK THIS SHOW IS ENLIGHTENING, EDUCATIONAL, HUMOROUS, ENTERTAINING, EMOTIONAL & EVEN INSPIRATIONAL AT TIMES. I GIVE THIS SHOW AND THIS PARTICULAR SEASON 5 BIG STARS. I HOPE THIS SHOW CONTINUES TO AIR FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY CURRENT FAVORITES. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT YOU REALLY SHOULD. I REALLY THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MEDICAL SHOWS EVER IN MY OPINION. HOUSE ROCKS+dvd
Jimmy Cagney returns!+P+The only E. L. Doctorow book I ever read was "Ragtime," and I read it because I enjoyed Milos Foreman's film version. I wasn't impressed with the novel. The author's writing style was excruciating--on purpose or unintentional, I don't know--in a way that reminds one of Theodore Dreiser. Moreover, I continually found myself sighing heavily over the book's anachronisms. Sorry, but the early twentieth century WAS NOT the 1960s! Quit trying to rewrite history! Doctorow did do a few things right, however. His characters, at least a few of them, were interesting. Too, I liked how he integrated their tales with real life historical figures and events. So when I recently learned that Foreman's version of the book came out on DVD, I decided to rewatch the film. The director, who made "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975, went on to lens several other memorable films, including "Amadeus," "The People vs. Larry Flynt," and "Man on the Moon." If you're familiar with any of these movies, it's obvious Milos Foreman likes using his camera to document kooky characters. "Ragtime" provides him with plenty of opportunities to examine oddball personalities engaging in often oddball behavior. Those crazy Gilded Age Americans!  Several major and minor stories wend their way through "Ragtime." We follow a well to do New York family--consisting of "Father" (James Olson), "Mother" (Mary Steenburgen), and Mother's "Younger Brother" (Brad Dourif)--that seems to represent the WASP majority. The family becomes embroiled in a pregnancy scandal involving a black woman named Sarah (Debbie Allen) and her lover Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Howard E. Rollins Jr.). While Walker attempts to ingratiate himself with our WASP family in an effort to win over Sarah, he becomes involved in a minor scandal when a group of firemen led by Willie Conklin (Kenneth McMillan) vandalizes his automobile. Other threads focus on a poor Jewish artist named Tateh (Mandy Patinkin), whose invention of a nifty little gimcrack called "picture books" leads to a career as one of Hollywood's first film directors. A notorious murder case also takes center stage from time to time. When renowned architect Stanford White (Norman Mailer) starts fooling around with airheaded Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), her jealous lover Harry K. Thaw (Robert Joy) pops a couple of caps in White's noggin--in full view of hundreds of witnesses. As you can see, "Ragtime" covers an enormous amount of material.  Remarkably, the movie works quite well. The first part spends all of its time establishing the story lines and fleshing out the characters. The second part focuses largely on Coalhouse Walker's failures to achieve justice for the wrongs done to him. He eventually turns into a terrorist who, with the help of a few friends, bombs several firehouses around town. Then he seizes a library in New York City, wires it with explosives, and threatens to blow the place sky high if he doesn't receive a new car to replace the damaged vehicle. Let's see--what else happens? Well, Younger Brother strikes up an affair with Evelyn Nesbit only to discover she's a total ditz that flits from man to man in search of easy money. Disenchanted with his failed relationship, Younger Brother falls in with decidedly unwholesome elements that--surprise--play a big part in the film's most important segment. Mother and Father drift apart over a number of issues, not the least of which involves Sarah's baby but also Father's stuffiness when it comes to progressive issues like feminism and race. Booker T. Washington (Moses Gunn) and Harry Houdini (Jeffrey DeMunn) also pop in from time to time, although the former plays a bigger part in the proceedings.  Man, is this a tough film to summarize! Foreman and company pack a ton of stuff in two and a half hours and still fail to incorporate everything Doctorow put in his book. Oh well. Only a television miniseries could hope to achieve a faithful adaptation, and even then it wouldn't work considering the very adult material Doctorow placed in certain segments of his story. I think the best way to view the film is as a well-done period piece populated with a stellar cast. The costumes and the set pieces look great, from the glittery buildings populated by the elites to the dirty tenement houses where Tateh plies his trade. Performances are sublime. Watching Jimmy Cagney play a tough as nails police commissioner is wonderful, especially when you consider he hadn't appeared in a movie since 1961. Donald O'Connor, Pat O'Brien, Jeff Daniels, and even Jack Nicholson turn up as well in smaller roles. The late Kenneth McMillan, a personal favorite of mine, deserves special mention for playing a racist scumbag that you'll love to hate. Throw in an amazing score from none other than Randy Newman, and the result is an extremely entertaining film that holds your attention for 155 minutes.  Extras on the disc include a commentary track with Milos Foreman and producer Michael Houseman, a lengthy deleted scene involving McGovern's character meeting anarchist Emma Goldman, and a featurette on the making of the film. My only real problem with "Ragtime" the motion picture concerns the anachronistic attitudes on race. I highly doubt the police would take the word of a black man over a white firefighter back in the 1910s, nor would there be as much sympathy as there is for Sarah's plight. That's the 1960s talking. Anyway, the film is a winner for the reasons I stated above. I also should mention that any movie that shows all around jerk and agitator Norman Mailer taking a bullet in the head gets my vote any day! +dvd

Making a Poor Film Useful in the Classroom+N+After reading the novel by Jane Yolen with my 7th grade classes, I was eager to view the film version.  I had heard conflicting views of the film- it's great, it's horrible, etc.  After viewing it for myself, I must agree with those who gave it negative reviews.  However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom.  True, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them.  Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story.  Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely.  Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing.  Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen's novel, which they found so riveting.   On a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams.  It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills.  After reading the novel and viewing the film, most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear!+dvd
Made for COINCIDENCE theorists.  No truth here.  +N+I have never seen a WORSE production by National Geographic than this.  I have lost respect for them after this awful DVD. They did not do their homework, nor did they connect the dots.  Very disappointing.  Watch "9/11 - In Plane Sight" instead+dvd
I had no idea+P+Wow! I had no idea that people could be so close-minded and prejudiced--and about a movie for crying out loud! I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie. And this from a reviewer who called this movie racist--talk about hypocrite!  Quite frankly, I thought this movie was hilarious. The acting is supposed to be life-less. The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?  I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it. Liking this movie does not mean I don't like other more classic/mainstream comedies. Young Frankenstein, The Birdcage, The Producers, The Wedding Singer etc are all great movies and great comedies. Napoleon Dynamite is just one more that SOME people in enjoy. So lighten up+dvd
Incredible+P+Only in this masterpiece can you find Arnold Schwarzeneggar saying "I'm not a pervert!  I just wanted the Turboman doll," "Put the cookie down!  Now!" and "Rock-'em-sock-'em jet pack!"  along with classic moments like Arnold busting into a radio station, kicking down the door and yelling like a madman to a frightened DJ.  Parents, this is a must buy.  You may be able to relate to it, but you'll probably have more fun laughing at how ridiculous it gets (you're children will think you're laughing at the broad humor).  The fact that a parade features a working Turboman suit complete with jet pack kills me just thinking about it+dvd
Living proof as to why and how Hollywood often insults the intelligence of today's movie-watchers.+N+This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.  Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's "pet" squirrel escape his pants to the "bathroom" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call "toilet-bowl humor." Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call "amiable," "heart-warming," or even "cute"; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe "artist" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a "special edition" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing+dvd
Bland boring failed thriller offers too many things that dont really add up+N+Johnny Depp (Secret Window, Ed Wood) goes up into space with his friend, actor Nick Cassevettes (son of Director John Cassevettes, starred in Face/Off) and both of them come back, in tact although Cassevettes soon after at a party dies and then his wife kills herself. Theron becomes more and more suspicious of her husband as she finds out evidence that Depp might not be her husband, but get this, an alien and that the twins she's carrying in her stomach are aliens as well. Then, she's all alone when her Sister and other's wind up missing. Bland boring thriller offers too many things that really dont add up to anything and the finale is hilariously dumb. Depp tries his best to rise above material that seemed to of been remade from other good movies and Theron cant show her talents as she lets all the stuff crumble on top of her....she's done way better people and so has Depp. Also starring Joe Morton (Speed, Terminator 2), Clea DuVall (Ghosts Of Mars, 13 Conversations About One Thing), Tom Noonan (Armageddon, Knockaround Guys), Donna Murphy and Gary Grubbs (Tv's Angel). A failed thriller+dvd
Repeat:  this is NOT Ruby Cairo!+N+"Deception" is the edited version of "Ruby Cairo," which is not a great movie but which is better than this one.  It isn't just the sex scene that was edited out, but a total of about 20 minutes.  The movie makes more sense in the RC version, and the sex scene, though dark and in Andie's case a bit airbrushed, is worth seeing, especially if you are a Viggo Mortensen fan.  I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely.  The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman.  It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way.  There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters. He looks about 10 years younger than she does, even with a beard+dvd
What TIME is it?+N+When Prince decided to embrace R&B and eschew rock and roll in his original compositions, he became just another act, IMHO.  His work from 1999 up through Sign O' the Times was nothing short of genius, but for some reason he decided to turn his attention away from groundbreaking, genre-busting work and concentrate more on being a run-of-the-mill R&B and funk revue - complete with dance troupe and annoying horn section.  This is Prince Vegas-afied. He's become a caricature of his former self.  Listen to his older stuff like "Ballad of Dorothy Parker" or "Lady Cab Driver" and compare it to the dreck he's come out in the 90's.  It's like night and day.  Prince dances, sings, plays guitar (underwhelmingly) all over this DVD, but it just feels like Prince has become a cheap, glitzy version of himself. And the "Jeebus" stuff gets real ridiculous real quick as well.  I'd love to see Prince just strip it down to a four or five piece band (sans horns) and get back to being about the music and not the spectacle.  He could have been one of the great music stars in history, but he's decided instead to just be another R&B revue... shame, really.  That said, The Time comes to DELIVER THE GOODS, and kicks His Royal Badness to the curb with great performances of "Jungle Love" and "The Bird".  I'd have rather seen them headline the DVD! +dvd
Torture to watch+N+I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating+dvd
Did we see the same movie??+N+Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap+dvd
The Resurrection of Lord Voldemort - Perils of a Teenage Wizard+P+Harry enters teenage-hood complete with his first serious crush, a Quidditch World Cup, and budding feelings between Ron and Hermione.

The progressive maturity of Harry and his friends hint at the struggles to come+dvd
The Complete Gidget Collection (Gidget / Gidget Goes Hawaiian / Gidget Goes to Rome)+P+i loved the collection.very goo+dvd
I am reviewing the shows not the format!+P+This is a wonderful collection!  It is misleading and disappointing to see the rating for this set so low--especially when many ratings were based on "wide screen" as opposed to "full." The format doesn't change the story or the fun viewers have watching.   "Gidget Goes to Rome", however, is my least favorite.  James Darren had chemistry with Sandra Dee and Deborah Walley; it was lacking with Cindy Carol.  Enjoy the innocence of an era gone and relish the fact that we are fortunate these movies are still around --- in wide or full screen+dvd
[No 0 star rating]  An Unbelievably Stupid Film+N+Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)  For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her  into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!  Stupidity not worthy of further commentary+dvd
Thoroughly predictable "thriller"+N+The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details)+dvd
Ouitstanding Movie+P+Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo+dvd
the mysterious equations of love+P+In the contest of love and Jennifer Connelly against the infinitude of chaos, the match goes to love and Connelly, 1-0.  Mrs. Elizabeth Nash - as played long-sufferingly and with an understated intensity about her performance that can only be called gorgeous - is one of the several centerpieces of this memorable film.  You don't get a clinical presentation of schizophrenia here, and the news coverage following this 2002 film suggests that you don't get a history of Princeton mathematician John Nash's life either.  What you get are epic performances by Russell Crowe and partner Connelly, together with enormously assured supporting roles by Ice King Ed Harris and Paul Bettany, together with the kind of rich and textured cinematography that must have upped Princeton's application rate with its sheer autumnal elegance.  Crowe's heroic battle against the delusions that plagued Dr. Nash's mind are gladiatorial in scope, though it would be difficult to imagine a role more restrained and internal where that famous acting played out violently and before drooling crowds. As one of Rome's famous gladiators, Crowe found redemption by bringing down a sinister emperor. Here he does so by quietly accepting the pens ceremonially laid before him by his Princeton colleagues and then by explaining that 'it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.'  Those who love or have been loved against the infinitude of chaos will understand Dr. Nash's discovery, regardless of whether the real Nash ever said those things from behind a Stockholm podium.  Don't overlook this film when building your posterity collection. As human drama goes, a finely crafted fiction can ring more true than the connected dots of what really went down and who said what+dvd
"No-laughs-for-us C.H.O."+N+I'm a Cho fan, and consider "I'm the One that I Want" to be just about the best stand-up act ever made... If you like Cho, you definitely HAVE to see that one, her first release. This second one is quite possibly the WORST stand-up act ever made. The lady definitely goes to extremes.  Where to begin? The lighting is poor, she looks like she's had a few too many, her jokes are stale reruns, and she's just plain off. I don't know what happened here, but she obviously does not understand the concept of Quality Control.  I made a special trip to Atlanta to see this one, being a big fan, and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve NEVER AGAIN to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on DVD and I can rent them cheaply. Because, most movies are crap!  Two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up DVD+dvd
NOT FOR DIE-HARD FANS!!+N+If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Empire Records, DON'T buy the Re-Mixed Fan version... it's a big dissappointment.  There are added scenes in the movie, and some of the BEST lines are changed.  Example: When Rex is leaving the store and says "Why don't you all just fade away."  Yeah, he doesn't say that in this version.  I was very dissappointed when I saw this, b/c die-hard Empire fans DON'T want the best lines changed, so this really isn't a "fan re-mix" b/c it changes stuff the fans LOVE!!!  Definitely just buy the regular DVD or VHS version... it's much better as an original, not a re-mix!!!+dvd
Great Series+P+Lucille Ball's second TV Show "The Lucy Show" doesn't seem to come close to her first, the extremely popular "I Love Lucy", in amount of reruns syndicated on television. This is a shame since the quality of the two shows are very similar. In the series, Lucy stars as Lucy Carmichael, a zany secretary working in a Hollywood bank for her stodgy boss, Mr. Mooney. Lucy's less-than-efficient secretarial skills and wacky hijacks frequently infuriate her boss, but somehow she is loyal to him not matter what. The five episodes included in this DVD feature some famous guest stars including Carol Burnette (playing Lucy's librarian roommate Carol), and John Wayne, Milton Berle, Ruta Lee, and George Burns. Like in "I Love Lucy", Lucille's character fawning over the movie stars is very amusing and even though the series was made a decade after "I Love Lucy", she still does much of her physical comedy pretty well. The picture quality of the episodes is not the best and the menu navigation for the DVD is somewhat confusing, but those problems are not bad enough to distract from the shows. While its not quite as good as Lucy's first show, it's still a great show and worth a look if you enjoy "I Love Lucy" or Lucille Ball+dvd
UnNecessary Repeat+N+Who's idea was it to have Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks? Okay he is a good actor, but once they had shaved his head, did they not see how freakishly Enormal it was? or the shine? THe original Annie was awesome, it was perfect, it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.The new Annie doesnt even fit the bill, no red curly hair, which wasnt the original movies idea, it was based on the cartoon. My niece saw this one first, and then the original, and she LOVES the original even though she saw it second, she said the new one isnt "as fun to watch" and i agree+dvd
Please tell your children the history is different.+N+I realize historical accuracy was not the intent of the filmmakers here, but as a history teacher, I feel the need to beg you to tell your children that this is not the way Jamestown really went down. An unreal number of students enter high school believing that this film is a historical documentary, and the first step to teaching Jamestown is to convince the students otherwise.  Perhaps good can come from this film, in that it can teach young people to be critical of secondary sources+dvd
Full Version or nothing+N+I saw the full version in the USA in the theater under the title Queimada within the last year, and it was fantastic.  That's the version I want, and Region 1 customers should at least have that option.+dvd
No, No, No!+N+This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled+dvd
More of an overall workout+P+This is a good workout and you do work up a sweat even though this isn't really cardio (I do this with 5 pound weights).  There is minimal jumping- only when switching directly from a left-leg lung to a right-leg lung so this would also be suited to people who want an effective workout but are uninterested in high-impact exercise.  I really like a lot of the exercises- particularly the 'bow and arrow'.   She has great exercises that you do feel quite quickly and there aren't loads of repetitions so this also keeps it intersting.  Most of the time I don't specifically feel the exercises in my butt though.  That is, I think this is more of a general workout, and not so much 'brand new butt'- the day after doing this I'm not particularly sore anywhere, but overall tired.  Janis Saffel has 'cute California charm'- some people like this, some don't.  Some things I don't like about this workout are a) the music includes elevator music of familiar songs- such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stevie Wonder; b) she shifts her angle a good bit and does several exercises in quick succession at times (warm up, etc.).  I find the and speed increases the risk of having poor alignment so I focus on keeping feet facing forward so the exercise is properly done- not rushed and poorly aligned.  I'm sure if you're familiar with these exercises this is not a problem; c) some floor stretches and ab work take the place of a cool down section.  Overall though, this is a good workout and one you can build on easily by increasing weights in your hands and adding weights on your ankles and waist+dvd
There's an EYE in  My Soup!+P+THE CORPSE BRIDE didn't quite captivate me like THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CRISTMAS did, but even so it was an imaginative and entertaining claymation film with great animation and interesting character designs. The movie's dark use of colors creates the feeling of a black and white film. The story sparkles with witty puns, for instance, we hear the bride say: ''That just takes my breath away...or it WOULD if I had any breath!'' This is a cleverly written, beautifully animated film that should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of eight.  +dvd
it's okay+N+i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it+dvd
Abducted BY A L I E N S.....+P+This is not an easy movie to watch but one that can not be missed. It is about sexual abuse and its affect on children, the characters do not point fingers or blame their parents nor attacker but its a journey of self discovery whether let it be gay or straight. The movie is brutal, gritty and does not hide behind anything nor anyone. Let's the viewer know that everything beautiful tends to have dark secrets. The performances are good and GREG ARAKI is an awesome filmmaker. VIEWER RESTRICTED+dvd
Almost+N+It is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach.  The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime.  There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point.  They have decided to make the anime and movie more "real" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be "realistic" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.  The music and animation are excellent.  But I would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie+dvd
"Howards End" Criterion DVD Stands Above Previous Release+P+The original DVD release of "Howards End" was the no-frills which probably was fine with everyone who has a tight-budget on DVD collection.  However, after watching this version has totally changed my mind about Criterion DVD editions.  Now, the picture is crisp and sharper compared to the grainy texture of the original transfer.  The scene of Leonard Bast's stroll in the meadows of bluebells was so much more dream-like with the magnificent violet and green colors on the screen.  Also, the music seems to surround all around you compared to the original release which seemed almost like watching on the TV with speakers in your face.  You really have to appreciate that such a film gets the attention for being placed on Criterion release.  Actually, this is released through HVE which is pretty much sister company of Criterion.  Anyways, the film itself is probably the best production of the Merchant-Ivory team.  Its beauty is in its storytelling of the Wilcox and Schlegel families with the best performace from Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.  The supporting cast is equally good with Helena Bonham-Carter and Vanessa Redgrave.  You probably will get the most satisfication from viewing the second disc.  It has several commentaries from James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter tells her hardships with some scenes such as the row boat with the hidden roaring motor and also the rainy return home from a music recital with some trouble from the umbrella.  It was also interesting to listen from the production team about the transformation of London into the Edwardian period with the scenes and clothing/fashion.  Overall, this Criterion DVD edition is worth every penny if you are a fan of filmmaking.  You definitely appreciate the efforts and dedication of Merchant and Ivory to fund and make such a film.  I really can't regret this purchase since many times, films don't get the royal treatment of Criterion.  Oscar-worthy movies are usually quickly released to the masses rather than being tailored for those with higher standards for the DVD viewing experience+dvd
i thought anthony minghella was incapable of making a worse movie than "the english patient" ...+N+oops, mine bad!+dvd
The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...+N+The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released+dvd
Don't believe the hype+N+I've only watched the first six episodes so far, waiting for some in depth story to unfold with diverse characters... blah blah blah.  Nothing but a simple story line with everything spelled out.  There's no complexity to it, no unfolding of the characters, no mystery of peeling through the layers of their lives.  All the episodes seem so long and dragged out but nothing different ever really happens.  Boy tries to save girl, boy gets beat up, boy does what he feels is right without thinking it through, no strategy, no thought to his actions.  It almost seems like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes.  Another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil King Hamdo is such a whiny coward, but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects.  Somebody would have dethroned him by now, in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed, kill his guards, have him in there sights, and not only miss him, but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk.  The actions and reactions of this world are just to unrealistic.  I want my wasted hours back.  Good thing this only cost me twenty dollars +dvd
I've seen enough+N+I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium+dvd
How did this happen ?+N+I was shocked when I saw the episodes of the second season. I would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on TV ever. How come they just throw all that down the drain ? You really don't know what to think during the episodes. "Is it a comedy ? Oh, look at at satan and his friends having a chat.Am I supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? And now, is it a serious episode ?" Not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by Frank Black in the 1st season. To sum up, the second season left a lot to be desired. The only thing I can do now is re-watch season one.+dvd
An excelent movie+P+If you liked amelie , this one is definitely for you...  a good movie , that you can see to many times , every time you will unsertand a diferent thing... +dvd
TYPICAL ACTION FILM; 1.5 STARS+N+AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING.

IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''.+dvd
Not what I was hoping for+N+I like to laugh. This really didn't do the job. I was hoping for something monty python style. It has its moments. I've seen the one guy in the Sierra Mist commercials and they are funnier. I've read where these guys have done some shorts and they are better. I would like to find them if possible.+dvd
A real feel good movie+P+This is an awesome mid 80's teen movie, with a name that really doesn't match the film.  Janie Glen (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a military brat who relocates to Chicago, the home of her favorite TV show Dance TV.  She immediately makes friends with the ultra cool Lynn Stone (Helen Hunt).  Janie and Jeff are paired up as partners for the finals, they have friction which develops into good chemistry.  This is such an amazing 80's teen flick.  It also features Shannon Dougherty as Jeff's little sister, Holly Gagnier (the old Cassie from One Life To Live), and Jonathen Silverman (Single Guy, Gimme A Break).  The DVD doesn't include any extras to my knowledge but it does give you the option to view it in full screen or wide screen version, which I thought was pretty cool.  This is a real feel good movie! It really has nothing to do with the song though, and when the song is played in the movie, It's not Cyndi Lauper singing!  It was the 80's and this was after Footloose, Flash Dance, Breakin', and maybe Slam Dance, not sure about that last one, but maybe they thought it would be good not to have the dance theme related to the title, but this is totally a movie about a big dance contest and there are several dance scenes, practices, and lots of other teen angst moments (Jeff's father wanting him to go to trade school , Jeff's sister's insecururities, Janie's strict father, the spoiled enemy chick) sprinkled throughout the film. If you haven't seen it, check it out+dvd
Horrid...+N+This is going to sound like an exaggeration...but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I will admit that I didn't have high hopes for this film.  I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...  First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.  Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.  Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.  The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.  The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.  1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film+dvd
Evil Has Many Faces!+P+After the death of his mother, Elijah Wood is left with his uncle's family while dad David Morse takes off for two weeks to settle their future. Uncle has two children: a little girl and an older boy Wood's age: Macaulay Culkin. Behind Culkin's angelic visage, naturally, lurks the soul of a devil. Wood suspects the evil, but no one will believe him, and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing.  Director Joseph P. Ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror, what with this, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy. He claims, in the featurette, to want to reverse our expectations about Culkin's character, which is, of course, nonsense: we know going in that he's bad. And familiar as Evil Child territory is (think The Bad Seed, The Other, The Omen, etc., etc., etc.), this is still an effective example of the genre, benefiting from an admirably economical narrative.  The menu is basic, as are the extras: the theatrical trailer, and the usual featurette. Nuthin' special.  Very much a catalogue-filler release, with no real value-added on this disc. Sound and picture are acceptable, and the movie is a decent 86 minutes+dvd
Spinal Tarp+P+what can I say, on a scale of 1 thru 10 this movie goes to 11!+dvd
The House of Eliott+P+I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the House of Eliott.  The acting was fantastic, the dresses magnificent and the locations, as with most English mini-series, marvelous.  My only complaint is that it doesn't end!!  THere is no closure to this.  As you approach the last chapter of Season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left, and - oh surprise! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone!  Is there any chance that there is a Season 4 out there somewhere????+dvd
Cliched story, inferior animation.+N+We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.+dvd
"O" Please!!!!!!!+N+For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.  +dvd
Awesome+P+The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.    In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.  The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up+dvd
4 1/2 Stars  Jessica Alba in a Bikini! A Must See+P+Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the Bahamas waiting for that day when they'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems. When Jared's old friend Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship Zephyr. Unfortunately, the Zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine... cocaine its owner (James Frain) wants back.  Into The Blue has Great Acting, Good Directing, Great Special Effects, and Good Writing. Let me start off with saying I definitely prefer Paul Walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves I'm right. The Acting in this film has got to be its strongest point Jessica Alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and Paul Walker does a great job as well. Scoot Cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk! The Special Effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff. The Writing and Directing were also very good but I believe the Acting stood out the most.  Overall if you like Jessica Alba or Paul Walker or Underwater Adventures You'll love this movi+dvd
no title+N+Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter. +dvd
Well worth viewing+P+This is a great film.  Probably underrated by "professional" reviewers, it's full of energy, enthusiasm and fun.+dvd
Brilliant Comedy!+P+It's dark. It will make you cringe. The things that the main character,Jill, says and does - well no person who is right in the head does or says things like that! And it's some of the most freakin' brilliant comedy I've ever seen. Love it+dvd
Labyrinth - fantasy and fun+P+The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen.  The film is supplemented on this DVD with a "Making-of" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this "inside" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), "When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me," - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age.  Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more "real" than many of today's "realities" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-+dvd
Great Movie But MUCH Is Fiction.....+P+I am a math teacher myself so I have always had a special interest in this film.  I think it is very well done and it is very inspirational.    However, for anyone who wants to know the TRUE story of what happened with Escalante and his students, purchase the book "Escalante: The Best Teacher in America" by Jay Mathews.  The film leads you to believe that Escalante took students who didn't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score 5s on the AP Calculus test.  This is far from what really happened.  Escalante spent YEARS developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of Calculus.  There is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film.  The movie portrays it as the testing company (ETS) accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at Garfield High School couldn't have possibly known the material.  The true story is that some answers on the AP tests from Garfield were noticeably similar.  About 12 students made the same exact errors on one particular problem, and that is what made ETS suspicious.  So once again, a well done film, and while is it "based on a true story", it is far from a true story+dvd
Enjoyable+P+I utilize this tape on those days that aren't scheduled "off" days but on which I really have a hard time gathering the oomph for my usual high intensity workouts.  I do break a sweat, but I have dance experience and can embellish moves as needed.  In general, I love dance but despise dance workouts, (boring and often annoying), but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate.  Further, she breaks the video down into mini-routines, so if you wanted to, you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music, (she provides counts - mostly 8 but some 4 & 16 - throughout the video).  The background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs, which is a nice change.  Finally, if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements, this workout will be much less effective, so if you haven't danced before and aren't used to posture and breathing, keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles, or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout+dvd
Horrible work out+N+This is the worst work out tape i've ever purchased...its a waste of money...there is nothing latin about this tape..and her moves are so repetitive...u won't even work up a sweat However the viva latin rhythm work out was excellent...highly recomende+dvd
Sliding Scales+N+This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.   "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.  Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.  By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.+dvd
Disappointed+N+This movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity, believability, and budget. AND can we say... just squish the leeches already. Not worth your time+dvd
Cate, oh my...............+N+To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering. +dvd
very good very goooooooddddd!!!!!!+P+this is a very good tv show you have to hava it+dvd
Clever As Ever (almost)+P+If you've viewed Season One, and liked it (and you must have-otherwise why would you even consider buying Season 2)you will enjoy this second dvd.  Though the first season was [to me] much more interesting and action packed, probably because it was new and a fresh idea, this season's storylines continue to make surprise twists and turns.  Just to watch Eva Longoria's and Marcia Cross's characters get what they want, one way or another makes this a worthy purchase.  Not a learning experience, but excellent mindless entertainment!!+dvd
Good workout but...+P+I used the tape about 4 days a week and I really saw a difference in my body, especially my arms.  I only did the toning portion.  I felt silly doing the dance portion and I really don't care for the music.  Other than that, I recommend this video for toning. I have also tried "Optimizer" and "Strength and Grace" which are also very good and there is no dancing.  +dvd
The Perfect Prescription for Insomnia+N+Normally I love documentaries.  I've watched hundreds of them and with one exception I have loved them all.  However, OUTFOXED is the single most boring film I have ever seen.    A relentless rant against Rupert Murdoch's cable news station, this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with Fox News, but I cannot imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in Fox News to remain awake while watching this movie.  Watching OUTFOXED makes me realize what a genius Michael Moore is.  Whether you love him or hate him, whether you agree with him or not, you have to admit his films are entertaining.  This film, however, is a major bore.  - Regina McMenami+dvd
Not so fair and completely unbalanced - see my media scorecard+N+Pundits would have you believe that Fox news and Rupert Murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism.  They even based a Bond villian on Murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies. Nothing gets a liberal's eyes rolling than when you say you watch Fox News.  This Attackumentary wants you to believe that Fox is biased and not credible.  Watch this Attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions.  The former reporters gripe throughout this "piece" that Rupert Murdoch changed how reporters operate, for the worse in their opinion.  What actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change.  They had to work hard, something they probably never did before.  Murdoch, like any driven person, demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees.  Those that could hang, rose with Fox news.  Those that could not keep up appear in "OutFoxed".  Fox does have a bias on its commentary section.  This draws ratings.  The thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the Journalism from the Commentary sections even with Fox putting a big sign up saying "Commentary".  They are so used to their "Mainstream" liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they cannot tell the difference anymore.  Here is my latest scorecard:  Mainstream Media:  Latest and greatest from Reuters, a major supplier of news to the always objective "mainstream media"; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened.  This photographer decided that his photos (or the war) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image.  How many other war photos have been doctored this way?  On the Reuters' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage.  You had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story.  I guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident.   The bastion of liberal "non-thinking"; New York Times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on.  In other words, they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events.  They also revealed secrets that hurt the World's efforts on fighting terrorists.  CNN - Nicknamed the Clinton News Network during the 90's for swallowing anything the Clintons had to give and asking for seconds, the only thing they were upset about during the whole Lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk.  On their online "News Headlines" section they repeatedly have Lou Dobb's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news.  Lou Dobb's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for CNN and everything he states is opinion not news.  You would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike Fox they don't have one.  They think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news.  USA Today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal.  Oops, turns out it wasn't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily.  Over 70% of the American population agreed with the Bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating.    CBS's Dan Rather, this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the Republican revolution swept through Congress in 1994.  All his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away.  He launched a smear campaign against President Bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable.  His background investigation was nil.  People discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it.  After everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant.  The editor for the Los Angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election.  Finally there is Newsweek, whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries.  They were so eager to report the desecration of Islam's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened.  They ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves.  The blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain?   That is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer. If so, that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the World.  Perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues.    These are just minor examples of how the "Mainstream" Media operates.  These are real stories and influence real events in the world, sometimes with serious consequences.  This is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day.  If you want more then read the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg to get a real understanding.  I will stick to Fox News as I have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news.  Like any prudent person I take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means.  I do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct.  CNN, Reuters, CBS, Newsweek, NY Times all fall squarely into the "dubious at best" category.  All I have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because Fox separates the opinions from the facts,allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and America loves them for it.  The liberals hate Fox news.   Fox actually investigates and reports on what happened; not what the liberals wished would have happened.  They show the liberals for what they are, full of $%$^.  They hated it when Fox repeatedly showed then President Clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up, that is until he saw a TV camera and started shedding crocodile tears.  Fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90's was due mostly to Newt Gingrich.  Clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency.  Gingrich's congress would not send Clinton the pork barrel projects so he couldn't spend to excess.  I wish we had Gingrich leading the congress doing the same to President Bush.  I am sure Rupert Murdoch is feeling "Outfoxed"; right now his network is ranked numero Uno as it has been for some time.  This DVD is hovering between 2000 and 3000.  I am ranked higher than it is.+dvd
Not worth it+N+Boring!  All this time is spent during the DVD talking about the John Fisher technique, but not really showing you anything specific.  Lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted, all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique'.  Who cares!  I didn't order the video so that I could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique, I ordered it so that I could train my own dog.  So little instructional information was given and the video was so boring, me and my dogs fell asleep watching it.  What a waste+dvd
No subtitles and no closed captions?!  Why?!+N+We discovered that this DVD of Mission Impossible - The Complete First Season will not provide subtitles and no closed captions.  1960's TV Mission Impossible was my favorite TV show of all time.  We are hearing impaired (both deaf and hard of hearing) and we want to see what they said from this legendary TV classic show.  We survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations, prejudice and bigotry such as Audism.  Please don't buy this DVD without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from TV screen show to video without mastering of high-digital video techniques such as coloring, subtitles, etc.  Paramount Home Video company often made cheap and flawed DVD video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality.  You will be deeply disappointed when you see this DVD of "Mission Impossible - The Complete First Season". +dvd
mission impossible tv series+P+Anyone who has seen the mi films will not be disapointed with this series and it isnt about bike chases car chases blowing things up all the time etc it is about careful srtategic planning with gadgets or masks or by any other means to dupe the perpetrators involved in to believing something is really happening so the mi team can remove them to stop them being a threat to society. Each member has his own skills.  I think you will enjoy this series it gets better as it goes on+dvd
In search of the populism as new! +P+The search for the forgotten average man as a publicity stunt require by a newspaper, and how backfired.  A luxurious cast,headed for Gary Cooper (one of his best achievements) and Barbara Stanwyck (superb as always), a brilliant script and a gifted director makes of this film an exceptional picture.+dvd
The Fog of War -- We're In It Again+P+Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War.  It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands.  While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them.  The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations.  Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler.     MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions.  It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam.  It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him.  It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq.      Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 11.  In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject.  (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get).     1. Empathize with your enemy.    2. Rationality will not save us.    3. There's something beyond one's self.    4. Maximize efficiency.    5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war.    6. Get the data.    7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong.    8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.    9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.   10. Never say never.   11. You can't change human nature.  What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration.  That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson.    Fog of War is an excellent film.  In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters.  Pure evil does exist.  It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal. +dvd
Just because you're paranoid...+P+Just because you are paranoid does not mean they are not out to get you.  The title says it all and you have seen it a million times.  You have to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are shades of the "Bourn Identity" appear, as Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) must find out not only who they are but also who he is.  And will Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts) believe him or not or is she the bad guy or a target?   Aside from the plot is powerful acting by powerful actors.  How do they handle trust?  +dvd
I've tasted better, way better...+N+Major disappointment. Maynard's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his band-mates into this pile of dung just because he can. Not only was this album/DVD completely rushed and way less-than-perfected, I found it odd that in a chat with Maynard on October 29, 2003 he stated the following regarding the 13th Step, "I'm not thinking about that right now. I'm on the delivery table crowning ... breathing hard ... delivering my new baby ... and you're asking me if I'm going to have another baby someday". But yet eMOTIVe was rushed to be released in time for 2004 elections.   Maybe Mr. Keenan should heed his own advice: "You are ALWAYS responsible for your own actions, so choose them wisely".+dvd
Captivating+P+For those seeking a captivating 99 minute escape from reality into a beautifully filmed, flawlessly written, directed & acted world of fantasy this is the must see movie for you. The character's Ryan (Ryan Kelly), Melanie (Hayden Panettiere), and Grandpa (Armin Mueller-Stahl) will collectively take you on a memorable journey you'll want to take over and over. The "special feature" music video (Someone Like You)of Hayden is worth the purchase price in itself. Pop a bag of popcorn, and invite the whole family over for this one,..they will be thanking you afterward. +dvd
Poorly done mocumentary+N+24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into.+dvd
High Impact - well worth your time !+P+This is high impact film! For those who are interested in what happens after death, this film is very informative. It ties in well with the teachings of the Buddhist way of life and shows why it is important to live a proper spiritual life. Leonard Cohen's English rendition of the Tibetan scripture is commendable. The visuals are engaging and in sync with the narration.+dvd
The hallmark of a pseudo-scientist+N+There is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary: It is well presented with great CGIs, narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars (whatever this stars rating business means).  The problem is the substance: it is simply not there. Menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists (as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it.  I think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence. Menzies, starts off with his conclusion (rather than ending with it) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it. When all alleged evidence is demolished, he arrogantly states that he will not budge, "one millimetre" as he puts it, from his theory and that, in time, everyone will accept it as a fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.  A true scientist, even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint, always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future. Menzies does exactly the opposite: with no evidence on his side, he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong.  It saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea, Menzies - not a scientist but, at best, a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that PBS, helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him. The feeling one gets at the end, is that PBS ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap's air-ology.  Whilst visually pleasing, this PBS production is in substance a waste of time to watch, as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer+dvd
If you want to see Dune, watch the Miniseries+N+Ug. I really dislike this movie. Dune is one of my favorite books, and this movie totally ruined it. It is boring, confusing, unfaithful to the book, and just plain badly done. If you want to see the real Dune, watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it's sequel, Children of Dune. Both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material+dvd
Sleeping Pill!  Not a workout!+N+This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other.  I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace.  Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner.  I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it.  I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better+dvd
didn't like it+N+this movie was way too fictional. stephen king needs to stop writing+dvd
Why oh why don't I read reviews before I buy!?!?!+P+Even though this set has 4 dvds, it's really chopped up and feels incomplete. Some of this I know is a result of technical difficulties (such as The Who still playing while the broadcast was disconnected), but there are songs I specifically remember, and looking forward to seeing. I was very disappointed to not have the complete concert, or complete sets from bands (and no Led Zeppelin!?!?! c'mon man). It's still a landmark concert, The set from Queen was amazing, and the proceeds go to a good cause, but that doesn't mean that I'm not disappointed. When will the COMPLETE DVD come out+dvd
An indispensable documentary+P+"The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal" (1985 - 93 minutes), written, produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit, is a spectacular documentary about the life and workmanship of the director George Pal. It presents some very cool testimonies of Rod Taylor, Ray Bradbury, Tony Curtis, Joe Dante, Barbara Eden, Ray Harryhausen, Roy Disney, Charlton Heston, Walter Lantz, Janeth Leigh, Tonny Randall, Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise. Originally an architect, the Hungarian George Pal (1908-1980) is one of the best references of the fantastic cinema and the animation in stop-motion. Pal became famous in Europe for his advertising films using animation of dolls, technique named by him as "Puppetoons". The first one of them, in 1932, was a great success and showed cigarettes dancing. Running away from the Second World War, the director went to United States where he began to work to Paramount Pictures. He started making a series of short animations and soon he was producing and directing movies, always with his particular touch of fantasy and special effects. During five decades Pal produced and/or directed classics as "War of the Worlds", "Seven Faces of Doctor Lao", "Destination Moon", "The Time Machine", "Conquest of Space", "When Worlds Collide", "Atlantis: The Lost Continent","Sinbad ","Aladdin" and "The Wonderful Worlds of Brothers Grimm". "The Power"(1968) and "Doc Savage"(1975) were his last productions. An indispensable documentary.  www.enigmasonline.com/enigmidia +dvd
Chinese Hitchcock+P+"Koma" is a surprisingly suspenseful film.  While there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization, director Chi-Leung Law delivers a very old school Hitchcock suspense tale.  Close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story.  Angelica Lee as Fung Chi-Ching, a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend, does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium.  Andy Hui who plays her boyfriend, Dr. Tsui Wai-man, hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense.  As researcher Suen Ling, Karena Lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street.  The twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame.  Subtitled with Chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience.  "Koma" turns out to be a pleasant, often intelligent, surprise.  Enjoy!+dvd
One of Hollywood's Most Uplifting Moments+P+The story of Brando's charactor's decision to fight for whats right regardless of personal consequences. But to me the star of the show is Karl Malden who plays a Catholic Priest willing to put his life on the line to live as Christ told him to.  His speach following the murder in the cargo-hold is one of the most inspirational moments in all cinema.  +dvd
HO HO Now I Know!+N+Well it looks like my question regarding why these two "Classic Cartoon Favorites" DVD's are being released in September has been answered! Anywhey being honest, I do own one DVD of this series and that is called "Starring Chip N Dale" that is because there has never been a Chip and Dale collection on DVD before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons+dvd
Charming, but needed more focus+P+A 10-week program in New York City schools teaches ballroom dancing to 5th graders, imparting lessons about self-worth, respect, and etiquette.  Some of the students go on to dance in a city-wide competition.  This documantary focuses on the children of three schools as they prepare for the showdown.  As many other reviewers have noted, the film would have benefitted from a finer focus on a smaller number of kids.  This would have allowed us to see more of their personal lives and place the program in its context.  Nervertheless, there are many joyful sequences in this film, and the children are charming.  Those qualities go a long way+dvd
Shall We Dance? for 11 year olds+P+Starting in 1995, the New York City program in ballroom dance now includes 6000 children from all burroughs of the city.  This documentary observes 11 year olds learning body discipline, social etiquette, appropriate attire on their way to achieving a sense of self respect, personal dignity.   Some of the children inhabit neighborhoods where they stumble across drug addicts and dealers each day. The teachers of 3 different schools reveal secret tricks to overcome physical and social awkwardness in children and open them to their potential for becoming accomplished through structure, practice and smiling.  The children openly discuss their fears (my dad cheated on my mom) and hopes (do you like girls?) between classes as they march toward the selection process for the citywide competition (bronze, silver, gold levels) quarter, semi-finals and the glorious finals outdoors in sunlight.  The music is charming nostalgic, the dancing exhilarating; the children's enjoyment of their bodies in motion is contagious.  Recommend also seeing the original Japanese DVD Shall We Dance? to see the transformative power of dance to change adult self image and relationships. +dvd
Couldn't have destroyed the story worse...+N+I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.    See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.  Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!  Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too.    Read the book, don't watch the movie.  You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story+dvd
A solid movie+P+Patriot Games is a good thriller based on the very famous Tom Clancy novel. This movie has good suspense, good action and a good conclusion. At times, the movie is slow moving and a little unrealisitc but hey.. The movie's about an ex CIA guy, Jack Ryan played by Harrison Ford who goes on vacation with his wife and daughter. But, of course, something goes wrong. They go to London and Jack becomes a hero when he saves a higly ranked Englishman's life. But, in the process, he kills one of the terrorists that attacked him. And the brother of the guy he killed isn't pleased. And that terrorist and his pals go to the U.S to get revenge, mainly by targeting Ryan's wife and kid. So Ryan is on the most important case of his life where he has to save his family. The movie includes one very suspensful scene where the terrorists are in a van on the highway shooting machine guns at Ryan's wife's Porsche. That should make you want to watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good thriller, Tom Clancy style.+dvd
Real Friendship+P+This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.+dvd
Great Viewing!+N+Even if you are not a big sci-fi fan, you will still enjoy Dark Angel-The Complete First Season.  Besides having an impressive plot concept, the first season of the show gave us a look at some interesting personal interaction between believable characters.  I liked the second season for the way it developed the story line, but the first season was better done over all. Whether or not you like science fiction, you will get hours of enjoyment out of this box set of the first season of Dark Angel.+dvd
The Best Movie Ever ^_^+P+Xmen III is one of the best movies ever!! The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival.  This movie emcompasses all genres such as politics, action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, etc...this movie has something for everyone! From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie.  Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity.  With the perfect combination of story telling and presentation, one can understand both perspectives, whether it is for Xavier or Magneto.   This movie is nothing but perfect.   +dvd
Skewed Perspectives, great if you are determined to hate Wal-Mart+N+I watched this movie with no particular bias about Wal-Mart. I understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are, where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided. I think that for most people it is highly effective, but it didn't work for me.  I think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew, perspective, and propaganda.  When they talk about the sweatshops in China and Honduras I found myself --though I dont envy the workers-- laughing at the movie.  I used to live in China and I have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there.  It is the film makers and then the ex-employees (and they are assuming the viewers) who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little, but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with Wal-Mart. That is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist, not only a problem with Wal-Mart.  The movie also discuss how Wal-Mart employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that Wal-Mart pays very  little and then suggests that it's employess go on public assitance, but the truth is that is the same for the fast-food companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits.   I do believe Wal-Mart should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more full-time positions, but that is a business culture that expands well past Wal-Mart. I am a teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits, but I don't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools.+dvd
When the Dolls Ruled+P+For those of you who saw the Dolls back in the '70's, this is a time capsule version that brings you back to Max's Kansas City, Kenny's Castaways, Club 82, and more. The Dolls are young, brash, alive, and vital. Seeing Johnny healthy and built, or Jerry Nolan chubby, it's worth the price of admission. All of the Dolls are energetic and engaging. At the time, the world was their oyster and there was no place to go but up. Great sloppy chaotic versions of their greatest non-hits. A nice feature of the DVD is the Performance Only section, as well as the commentary. It does bog down a little in the middle, but picks right back up again as soon as the band hits the stage. Some of the comments are very funny. The black & white photography lends a "historic" feel. It's way better than it should be, given the time & technology advances since then. It ends around with the Red Patent Leather gigs at the Little Hippodrome, but without fan fare or anything maudlin.+dvd
n.y. dolls 101...+P+this is amazing! the holy grail for any dolls fan.if you like the dolls this is a no brainer...buy it now! professionally done,amazing footage,great bonus material.one of the coolest things i've ever bought or watched.watch history in the making.& what a great band.even though they are lumped in with punk or glam,i always thought they were a true rock & roll band in the purest form.the next step in rock's evolution after the stones,yardbirds,& pretty things.i can't reccomend this enough.+dvd
Not Even Worth Finishing+N+Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it+dvd
The Trinity Collection+N+The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered.  It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD.  If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality+dvd
Great Documentary ! +P+The 6 Episodes really showed how Broadway evolved and how it became what it is today. IT has great footage from all sorts of Broadway Productions from 1893 - 2004. It empisises the great Broadway producers & compsers too. The Special features are very nice too. If your a fan of Broadway buy the Dvd set , The Cd Set & the book they are all great+dvd
If you want a porn flick...+N+I was not happy with this purchase.  This video only taught 10 min. of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end.  The teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds, I could have used more teaching and less of a porn show.  This was a waste of money!  There are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise.+dvd
It's fun+P+Quentin Tarrantino promised us a "horror film for horror fans."  He lied.  It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, but it is a fun movie.  I gotta say, the first half is really, really good, but it gets a little lame when the vampires show up, but it's still one of those movies you can watch over and over. +dvd
Not bad at all for an indie thriller+P+As I never expect a lot from indie thrillers, this one was far better than I thought. Although the twists and turns were not quite unpredictable, they still got you some way or another. Also, enjoy a good performance (and some real nice body shots) given by Nastassja Kinsky if you're a fan of hers. To me Nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed. Josh Holloway (playing the psycho depressed hunk) was fine too. I would give this movie 5 stars if they cast someone more convincing (like William H. Macy) in the place of Jeff Fahey. But, as I said, I never expect a lot...+dvd
Top notch transfer for "Green Mile" and extras make this worth the double dip+P+The most important question is simple and straight forward; is this two disc edition of "The Green Mile" worth the upgrade? Yes. The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director. While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition. I suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve (along with improvements in digital technology)the look of the film.    We get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. Unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as Darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene (and the possibility of creating a "Director's Cut")most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased. The two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process. It used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves ALL the trims.  We also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project. He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.  We also get Tom Hanks make up tests, Michael Duncan Clark's screen tests, the teaser trailer (along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser), original theatrical trailer. We also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film. I would have liked a commentary from Hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track (although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although I doubt it would as valuable).   Nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get. I should point out that many retailers (Costco among them) have this available for $9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain.   REVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:  "The Green Mile" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of "Shawkshank". Based on the five short serial novels (now available as a single novel) published back in 1997. This marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace. It's not that it isn't involving it is but the third act of the fil is where the film picks up its momentum.   Nominated for four Academy Awards (including Best Picture)this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from Tom Hanks in the lead. Well worth picking up for fans of King's work but, more importantly, for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality.+dvd
Excellent!+P+Great exercises. Well worth the money if you intend on using it.    I never work out while watching the DVD but certainly integrate the exercises on this program into my routine with positive results+dvd
Feeling a bit shafted+N+Okay, I've wanted this film for a very long time, so this year I finally get around to ordering it.  However, I wasn't aware that Ridley Scott ever put together a director's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this DVD being the director's cut.  So, it gets delivered, I open it up excitedly...and see a box on the cover that says INCLUDES RIDLEY SCOTT'S DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH JERRY GOLDSMITH'S SCORE.  Okay, cool.  It INCLUDES the director's cut.  That implies that BOTH the theatrical release AND the director's cut are on the disc.  Not so.  This is ONLY the director's cut...and to be honest, it's not all that great.  And Goldsmith's score is NOT one of his better ones.  I was WANTING the Theatrical Release with that wonderful score by Tangerine Dream, the version I remember seeing so many years ago.  So, now I have to shell out the money for the ULTIMATE EDITION which has both versions on it.  If Amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which.  I feel about as shafted as when I bought "The Exorcist" on DVD...only to get THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN, which was equally lame+dvd
Really good although all over the place at times+P+This film is about a young porn star who of course had tragedy in her life.  When she was 12 her mother committed suicide.  After her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops Parkinson's Disease.  At 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life.  She juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by Rosario Dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher.  I really enjoyed this film but couldn't help but feel like the actress who portrayed Moon was doing her best Angelina Jolie impersonation, I mean she had Angelina down pat.  James Wood deserves an Oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down. I enjoyed this film, but like many other films I was frustrated with the story at times.  It seemed to be all over the place sometimes.  I never knew if the love story between Moon and her blind date was going anywhere, then we see Mon venture off into a new business, then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis'.  Although it was all over the place at times, it was a great little indy film, the best indy film I have seen since "Secretary.+dvd
Found in Translation+P+This Noam Chomsky speech on DVD is, as usual, enlightening. Mr Chomsky documents the facts, the truths, and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years. This speech and the bonus interview with the Harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively "believe" what we are told by our government, rather than seeking to "know" the facts (or simply ask, "wait, is that statement true?").  Mr Chomsky explains patiently, that facts are important. Words and meaning cannot be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners.+dvd
disapointed+N+Found this presentation very poor. After reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech, I was a greatly disappointed. It was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -I think you all know what im referring to here. I suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point. I give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this, I ask myself how can he be an MIT professor with such poor teaching skills, an off (ice) prof ?+dvd
Don't Waste Your Time+N+Uneven, choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable Meryl Streep.  Unfortunately, not even the fabulous Ms. Streep can save this -- recommended for devoted fans only, bent on completing their Streep collection+dvd
too much reality and not enough laughter+N+Was looking forward to seeing this film, quite disappointing. Joan Cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film. Once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing. Jennifer Anniston is usually pretty good, but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny, I felt. Just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line.  Not a film I will be watching again, sadly.+dvd
A Champion of Justice and Integrity+P+Al Pacino had appeared in "The Godfather", but was not yet the film icon that he started to become, in part, because of "Serpico".  Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop - courageously honest.  When he saw widespread corruption among New York Cops everywhere he was offered the opportunity to participate in the payoffs that the police were receiving left and right.  Initially, Serpico simply abstained.  The corrupt cops became of suspicious of Serpico - at one point in the film he is told "who can trust a cop who won't take a payoff?"  Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to "do the right thing" Serpico goes from a non-participant in the graft to actively fighting it.  He is understandably frustrated over and over when his reports to the police authorities are met with not much more than "you're doing a good job, Frank, keep up the good work and we'll reach out for you when the time is right".  The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department - first to the Mayor's office, then finally to the New York Times.   Serpico is treated by his fellow police officers initially as an eccentric goody-goody, then later subjected to death threats.  The film is bookended by a sequence in Serpico's life when he is transferred to a narcotics division then probably set-up for assassination.  The point-blank bullet that Serpico's partners lead him into doesn't kill him and Frank is alive today, lecturing at police academies and for organizations interested in having a "lamp lighter" - giving support to those who have the inclination, but perhaps not the courage, to speak up about things that are plain wrong.  Now, thinking about the film later, I wonder what was going on in the minds of the other policemen.  Presumably, many of them didn't WANT to be crooked cops.  Certainly the "extra" money that they received was tempting - perhaps they looked at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.    Serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone "doing the right thing" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened.  This is a good story that needs to be told and Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino tell it well+dvd
I could watch Vitti read the phone book (and I'm surprised she never gets around to that in this beautiful neo-realist classic)+P+This is the first movie I've Netflixed twice.  I kept it for two months the first time, watched almost all of it, but then lost patience and sent it back because there was something else I wanted to get quickly.  But I couldn't stop thinking back about it and wound up renting it again.  I'm considering just going ahead and buying it.  I still haven't figured out if I actually *like* it or not.  But I can't stop watching it.    How can a movie this cold and distant and remote be so affecting?  How can a film so full of detail and business be so cold and distant and remote?    Monica Vitti plays a stylishly unhappy woman who basically wanders around Rome, falling out of one relationship into another, with Alain Delon.  She's so wan that I often wanted to step in and shove her, but at the same time, she has an absolutely captivating presence.  Eventually, I actually stopped caring anything about the plot and just relished the endless scenes in which I could take in her long, slender nose and her slim, sleepy eyes.  Is that a intelligent reason for liking this film?  Probably not but fortunately I don't really care. +dvd
Self-Firm Flat Abs Fast+N+Well the title seems to fit the dvd "fast" but in a different aspect, as far as time goes. I thought this was very boring and slow, but it was over in no time at all. It probably would be great for someone just beginning and has very little or no time at all to exercise and it doesn't work up a sweat. It was very very easy to do and I'm a beginner myself+dvd
It's supposed to be funny - and it is!+P+Being Scottish, maybe I'm biased but this is a brilliant, laugh out loud funny , film. I looked at its reviews on the US Amazon site just to see what the Americans made of it - especially the accents. They're really not that "thick" as many reviewers state - I think even viewers from England understood them. Also, Trainspotting is intentionally funny; our sense of humour is not the same as yours though. Don't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible - its full of colloquial Scots (not Scotch - thats the drink).Theres also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film.+dvd
Lousy western, but my wife likes it.+N+I run hot and cold with Clint Eastwood. Hot with movies like "Outlaw Josey Wales", and "Dirty Harry". "Unforgiven" ranks right up there with  "Bridges of Madison County" as two of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Sorry fans+dvd
humanity of jack+P+Nothing happened to Jack Kerouac. He died like the rest of us eventually will. Jack Kerouac was a regular human being. Now you're problably saying &quot;yea I already knew that, so what?&quot;. But what you problably  didn't know is that Jack used literature to show how beautiful and ugly  human beings can be. Kerouac was a man equally feminine as he was masculine  (read Charter's biography about his relationships with Ginzy, N.C., as well  as the women of his life.) All of this is touched on in the video  documentary, which thrives off the somber emotion,and that sort of  &quot;grey sky comtemplation&quot; of things, which seems to pervade all of  Jack's work.  The video moves through Jack's life in a fairly  straightforward manner. We see him as a shy french speaking Mass.  adolescent, a cleft chinned Columbia undergraduate, a rucksack wanderer,a  chanting buddhist,an aloof catholic, who loved his mother and drank much  too much Johnnie Walker.  In &quot;What happnened to Jack?&quot; we see  Jack as who he really was, a confused, tortured, disenfranchised,happy,  unhappy writer who was very good at putting words together, which gave an  honest glimpse of what was going on in his heart and his mind.  There are  many great moments in the video. Any beat &quot;junkie&quot; will love the  footage of Jack and Allen coolin' it near Columbia, smoking cigarettes and  shootin' pool.  There's a clip of Bird and Diz blowing hot jazz, the beats  in S.F. at the debut of Ginzy's &quot;Howl&quot;, Mike McClure, Jack,  Snyder and Ferlinghetti at Big Sur recitin' and writin' smooth synapses of  the happenings there and around. There are countless anecdotes and picturs  of all your &quot;beat heroes&quot;, which portray them as strikingly  regular and very un-heroic.    The video as a complete work is very  delicious, but the tastiest bits come when Jack reads &quot;October in the  Railroad Earth&quot; to a montage of San Francisco images. When a debonair   Jack reads &quot;On the Road&quot; to Steve Allen's bluesy piano in perfect  phrasing and time. And last but not least there is the comical and  strangely serious Greg Corso explaining genious, fame, and why he thinks  the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; was a phenomenon. Kerouac would problably  want you to see this video because it shows that he was not a fad, an icon,  nor a saviour for a generation. He was simply a regular man trying to find  answers to very un-regular questions and he used his writing talent to  unravel those mysteries+dvd
For Gregory Peck fans+P+Keys to the Kingdom is a good offering for fans of Gregory Peck.  This movie trace the life of a man that becomes a missionary after suffering much personal tragedy.  The movie is a little on the long side, but is worth the time.  Look for a great supporting cast that includes Thomas Mitchell, Vincent Price, Roddy McDowell and Edmund Gwenn.  A good story and a good cast combine for a good movie+dvd
Not worth watching+N+All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over. +dvd
Delightful+P+I have a few friends who "don't like cartoons". I guess they were brought up on Hannah-Barbara drek and it turned them off of the whole genre. When I run into this attitude,I pull out Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoroto show them the beauty, subtly, and power of animation.+dvd
A 4-star movie with a 5-star ending+P+This was a great little movie.  It wasn't a stand out in the genre, but it had all the elements it should have had; a great lead cast, clever and funny writing, and most importantly, a good story.  Where it lacked, and lacked badly, is in the supporting cast.  Chris Kattan and Parker Posey were the weak links in both acting and story line, and in my opinion cost the movie a 5th star.    The story around Adam and Steve was very well done and I enjoyed the casting.  [Who knew Malcolm Gets had that body??].  It was a delightful movie night for my hubby and I.  We're both suckers for a sappy, happy ending, and this movie delivered.+dvd
disappointed+N+I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them.  However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed.  The camera man can't seem to sit still.  When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do.  By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow.  Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise.  It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment+dvd
Not as Advertised+N+I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as "Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it+dvd
A classic comming of age movie set in the 1980's+P+This is a clasic movie for many of us who were at that age in that time period.  If you are not turned off by the 80's too much you will love this funny movie.  It is trendy for then, but it is really funny and good.  Just realize at the time these movies were some of our favorites.  It is still near and dear to my heart.  I think it is a classic.  If you like it go on to Ferris Bulers day off and Somekind of wonderful for other movies in this style and time period+dvd
a telling picture of the future+P+This movie came out the same year that the Supreme Court gave us abortion on demand via Roe v. Wade.  How ironic is that?  We are living in these days to a certain degree already.  This film is disturbing on many levels because of it's impending reality.  I highly recommend it as a wake up call. +dvd
Soylent Green - Pure Fantasy or Potential Reality+P+My watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world. The premise of the film was disturbing to say the least. I have never been a true fan of Charleton Heston who in my opinion always has overacted. However, Edward G. Robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played. His performance was truly heartfelt, bringing to mind the current debate on "ending one's own life with dignity". I shutter to think that this is life as it should be though. But Robinson's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him. I found the other actors to be somewhat bland. Perhaps this was acting at that point in time, but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot. The story line was unique, but the script was lacking. A re-make today by Steven Spielberg might be worthwhile seeing. Perhaps the most striking element I took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up+dvd
One of the Best Shows Ever!+P+Bewitched is one of the best shows ever. Forty years later their still fun to watch. Each ep. is funny and well written. Samantha marries the mortal Darren and promises to give up her magic to the endless dismay of her mother the wonderful Endora but luckily somehow Samantha ends up using magic. Aunt Clara pops in often and creates her own chaos with her mix-up spells.  Every single ep. is my favorite.+dvd
As good as the BBC production+P+Comparable in quality to the BBC production in six parts starring Colin Firth as Darcey and that was not easy to achieve.  Moreover the additional treats such as Joe Wright's comments on his work are highly interesting+dvd
War & Rememberance+N+We were very disappointed - it seems that a considerable amount was left out, whar happened? The TV series included considerable more than was in that set of DVD's. We saw them a couple of weeks ago and are still quite angry!+dvd
Totally amazing, this is when American cartoons were nothing short of mind blowing.+P+I just got back into Batman after finding out they put Batman Beyond was in one collection. After that I started to remember why I loved batman so much. So I went out and got all 4 volumes and the last one IMO held up the best. It's been fun revisiting Batman again and I hope to see Bruce Tim make one more series.+dvd
is there anything more tiresome than social satire 30 years later?+N+some stories date really badly, and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one. all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s POV, and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant. decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn, but the writing and directing cant be compensated for.+dvd
Trey Parker and the gang now show exactly why South Park isn't a kids show.+P+This movie shows that South Park was never intended to be a kid's show.  When the show was seen through the human eye it was also then known that it wasn't concidered a kid's show.  This movie is outrageous and shows the hilarious side of vulgar language.  Any South Park fan who is offended by vulgar language is used to the show being cencored on TV.  This movie is not for the easilly offended.  Especially for people easily offended to the F word.  This movie is hilarious and extremely outrageous.  On Comedy Central they got away with airing it on TV only by showing it uncencored.  Great film for the South Park fan and the ones not offended buy vulgar language+dvd
Horrid Movie+N+I saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine.  I was strongly mistaken.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great abilites, but this is the worst movie of his I have ever seen.  Even his "cheesy" movies were better than this.  The rated R rating is light.  I couldn't believe how pornographic it was.  Even in Quills, it wasn't as raunchy as this.  Don't waste your money or your time with this one+dvd
This film finally gets the red carpet treatment from MGM!!!+P+Finally "The Good,The Bad and The Ugly" finally gets the red carpet treatment it deserves from the guys at MGM Home Entertainment!!! This superlative 2-DVD set includes the extended version of the film in both English and Italian!!! Wow!!! It sports BOTH great picture and sound!!! It also contains a wealth of extras to enjoy!!! This great DVD set will keep you amuzed for hours!!! And to cap it off,it comes in a nice collector's case!!! A very well rounded package of a very superior western starring Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef,and Eli Wallach!!! Sure, it costs "a few dollars more" than the standard single disc version but it's well worth the money!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+dvd
Predictable and Uneven+N+I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here. From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time.  "The Hand" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody. "Equilibrium" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin. But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces+dvd
Wreaking Havoc With My Sensibilities+N+What can I say about the truly inspired film "Havoc" that hasn't been said before?  Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award winning documentarian, taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture--sounds like a recipe for success!  Add a talented cast of appealing up-and-coming actors given really meaty roles--awesome!  Not so much...  "Havoc" is, unfortuanately, an unmitigated disaster.  You won't believe your eyes.  The kids, the gangs, the streets of L.A.--everything just rings so false.  The last time I saw so many posers "playing" street toughs was at my Junior High auditions for "Grease".  And I think we could have taken these kids.  A lot has been made about the "shocking" sexual content of the film.  Anyone "shocked" by this movie probably doesn't see very many movies.  Anne Hathaway does appear naked, which seems to be a selling point, but she and everyone else deserves better.  I'd actually have rated the movie about a 4--because it's a campy mess!!!  If someone had realized that this was a B-level exploitation flick, and sold it as such--I'd have bought into it.  No, though.  This is a "serious movie" and "important" document of our time.  Sadly, on that scale, these kids need to go back to school because they failed+dvd
Blecchh (warning - spoiler ahead)+N+This was an awful movie.  The premise was an obvious rip off an Outer Limits episode (Straight and Narrow), but I was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format.  I was sadly disappointed.  The film eliminated everything that was interesting about the Outer Limits episode, and instead filled itself with...nothing.  In the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the "bad guys" about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect.  By the time the credits rolled, I was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea, when properly executed, and I don't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers.  To sum up: don't watch this movie.  It's bad.  Watch the 1990's Outer Limits episode, "Straight and Narrow," starring Ryan Philippe, instead+dvd
Sexy, not serious+P+If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Dracula, this is not it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It's a fun, popcorn movie that will not make you think. At all. Seriously. Not a thought in your head, unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of Scotland since kilts, Gerard Butler.  Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full "Atilla" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable.  So if you like wire fight scenes, new intrepretations of old myths, Mardi Gras beads and pretty Scots, this is the movie for you. If you want to think, there are plenty of documentary DVDs available on this site!  Cheers+dvd
Gantz and Life After Death+P+Gantz is a tense, emotion wringing story with a lot of blood and a side portion of sex.  Unless you are very tolerant of hardship, blood and sex this isn't for young children.  Parents won't want their children to watch these episodes until they are 18, teenagers will love watching the show when they are 15 and perhaps even a bit younger and will miraculously be totally unharmed except being exposed to a couple of interesting ideas.  Ideas (certainly not comprehensive): 1) What happens after you die could be Heaven or Hell, could be nothing, or it could be something else entirely that no one has considered before 2) Young men tend to be more horny than have sense.  (Amazing how for some reason this just isn't projected most times there are teenagers around) 3) Materialist idea of 'you' or 'I'.  It appears that almost all of the characters in the show are 'captured' at the time of their death and recorded and transported to Gantz.  This either implies that the soul is recordable and recreatable or that the soul is unnecessary in the recreation of a person. 4) The weaponry appears to be fairly original.  Kei Kurono is certainly the most interesting character in the series.  He can be annoying and is certainly obsessed with sex, but I think that merely makes him a relatively accurrate depiction of a teenage male.  One of the key points in this very violent series is that violence is real and although the activities in the Gantz games are certainly violent, you can't get away from violence even in a place that should be safe like home.  This is demonstrated by Kato's little brother being beaten by their Aunt that is taking care of them because their parents are dead.  The effects of violence at home, rather than violence in the Gantz activities are what appear to motivate Kato to incredible rages.  Kato, who is the most reasoning character in the series.  Kato, who is unable to kill in order to survive or even protect his friends - is driven by the violence at home and school to beat people insensible.  The series is neat.  Not all questions are answered in the first series.  Nor, I suspect are they answered completely in the second season.  Some questions perhaps we do not have the answers.  Some answers are held in the Manga and possibly Japanese Anime versions of the show.  I hope they continue to produce Gantz Anime, and perhaps some of those answers will be revealed.  Perhaps it will be like the original Guyver series.  One of the best Anime I've watched and I was horrified that the end, was in fact the end.  Clearly a show (just as Gantz) that there is plently of material to continue the story.  While I'd love to continue reading the story in the Manga, it appears to currently not be available in English.  I will hope that people will be able to watch this show and not be put off by the sex and violence contained within it - just as they are contained in real life.  It certainly provided me with a nice diversion.  Oh, and yes, I hate the fact that there are only 2 episodes per disk.  Who makes that kind of decision?  I have anime with 5 episodes per disk, 2 episodes per disk but most commonly 4 episodes per disk.  Don't waste resources people!  13 episodes could have easily fit on 3 disks compared to 6!  The extra disks, cost to the manufacturer, extra materials for disk holders and the large box - man - it just makes sense to shave some cents off the cost of the series and sell it for the same amount and make more money than waste all those disks with 2 episodes each.  Blech.  Good thing I really like the series.  Atheists, agnostics and secular humanists will probably enjoy this series as well as people who are fairly moderate in temperance.  Folks that take their religion too seriously, don't like anime, don't like sex or feel that there is too much violence on TV - need not apply.  Funny how this is a Japanese animation, with so much blood, guts and sex and they have lower incidences of violence in their country than in the USA.  Must not be the violence and sex on TV that causes the problems, folks!  If blood, guts and sex on TV causes it in reality then Japan must be overrun with roving gangs, rapes and thousands of murders, but we know this is not true+dvd
banality by any other name+N+Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.    A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended+dvd
The First Woman in the Workplace Film+P+9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling.  It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.  We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is "banging the boss".  But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.  Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.    The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.  The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.  The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.   You will laugh until it hurts.  DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly  9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily.

MASH as great as ever+P+MASH matured each season, adding more depth to both the performances and script. There has never been as good a TV series, and continues to gain significance as the years pass+dvd
How this movie got so many good reviews is beyond me.+N+I like Sissy and Marissa but holy cow, this movie moved at a snails pace. I almost fell asleep waiting for the gun shot.  The story is so typical girl with two kids looking for some sap to help her out so she picks a naive high school grad.  pulls some smooth sex moves on the poor kid and gets his pee-pee all in a whirl and he becomes king kong and wants to protect her from her "horrible" estranged hubby, and play daddy to her brats. Its a no win situation, legally he's an "adult" so mom and dad can't forbid him from diddling with the tramp and unfortunatly he's in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets killed for no good reason.  And she ends up going back to her estranged hubbby and thinks what he did to get her back was soooo romantic.  The world is full of dumb c--ts and even dumber men.  Don't bother with this one+dvd
Jackie + Tucker = Hk meet Hollywood+P+Plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense, but it turn out funny because of that, comedy scene here won't be as class as the first, but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking,  great cast in this set,  however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star, so i hoped the third one will be best in the series+dvd
Real doc or commissioned vanity piece? +P+Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production  with an "A+" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a "debut" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding "Dream Of The Blue Turtles" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some "oh so precious" moments-especially a sequence depicting a "goofy" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in "La Dolce Vita"? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite "Spinal Tap" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her "lack of imagination" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a "Brechtian effect". (You couldn't write something that funny.) The tardy yet belated release of the film on DVD should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics,sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period+dvd
It had some good moments, but was mostly boring.....+N+I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.  This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.    The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!  The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.  I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.  NOT recommended+dvd
No Stars from a  Cold War Submariner+N+I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot.    Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers.   It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it.   From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water +dvd
too loud+N+When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash+dvd
Top 5 of the funniest movies I have seen+P+This is a truly funny movie. The main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is. This is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night. It's a good buy for your DVD collectio+dvd
Hollywood, get over yourselves!+N+There was some great lines and the ending was funny. Still, it was a movie spoofing about itself. It really wasn't all that good. Yes, plenty of celebrities. Still so what?+dvd
Get this version, not the with the smiling kid on the cover+P+This version sticks to the book quite faithfully.  (There was a later version, and THAT one's cover features a smiling kid.  THAT version made a lot of changes from the book.  THIS version has a close-up of the creature on the cover.)  Yes, the special effects are BBC /"Dr. Who" cheesy, but they don't distract from the series.  I read the book to my [...], and then she watched this and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So did her 30-something parents+dvd
Wonderful film but poor DVD quality+N+I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [...+dvd
Disney is a joke.+N+Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films?  And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending.  Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!  What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next?  The Scarlet Letter? +dvd
Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!+P+A very good movie, Kiss the Girls, sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in North Carolina. There are slight hints of Seven, The Bone Collector, Resurrection, and The Silence of the Lambs so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category, though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror. Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well! Overall, though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.+dvd
The STRONG should PROTECT the WEAK--or  slaying the "judicial/bureaucratic" Goliaths!+P+Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic "David", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury.   The above is past history...just mentioned in the film.   It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years,  ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens  as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help.   He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around,   ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the "Goliaths" he goes up against.    However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case.    Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving.      His Goliaths include:  The biased, hostile Judge, the "Prince of Darkness" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye,  ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage.    Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian "Good Samaritan" story seriously.    My family caution:  There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene.     The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict.    Will they go with the letter of the law?  Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...)   (Hint of spoiler below)   My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury  who could see the spirit of the law!    Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared  (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude)    to merely ask for a second look at the whole case.  Meanwhile, Terri slowly starved to death...Shame on us! Shades of Nazi Eugenics!!!  +dvd
terrible customer service+N+this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package!!!!!!amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens!   However.....LARRY BIRD IS THE MAN AND DONT EVER FORGET THAT+dvd
IF you paid a buck for this, then you paid 99c too much.+N+Absolutely do not buy this video.  1) The fights are not fights. they are boring and tiresome staged tapping, pushing and pulling matches. Nobody wants to hurt anyone, and nobody wants to get hurt.   2)Jerry Springer fights are 10 times better than anything on this video. These girls keep their clothes on , and tussle like 4th grade girls at a sleepover.   3)ModelFight.com has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they don't fight.   4) The most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say "you better get out my room ! *smiling* *No, You get out !* says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed.   Complete waste of time and money.  You want chick fights, look elsewhere.+dvd
Taking guitar lessons to a new level+P+This is a great DVD.  The guitar style spectrum is covered here with country, blues, and rock, with tips and tricks to enhance your own style.  Greg uses Fender Strats and Telecasters (my favorite guitars) throughout the video and explains and demonstrates his unique style in a way that you can pick up on with a little practice and not be totally discouraged.  This DVD is filled with humor, great teaching and superb pointers for expanding your technique.  If you are a fan of Greg Koch or would want to make your playing really stand out, you need this video+dvd
(...)+P+Mr.Show rules. This movie is funnier than POO!!!! (...)The movie Joe Dirt totally stole Run Ronnie Run's idea and fire. Anyone who likes a lot of swearing and stupid humor should check out this movie. You should also buy all 4 seasons of Mr. Show on DVD!!!+dvd
A great classic!+P+You will want to buy this movie once you have see Madea's Family Reunion+dvd
Brainy Baby - ABC's+P+Believe it!... This is a great video. Brainy Baby just seems to really know how to connect with children when it comes to teaching. The lady who gave this a one star and wrote a book about her feelings, is a bit over the top and has way too much time on her hands. We also homeschool our children and found that this video really helped them when they were younger to learn the alphabet. Remember, this is a PRESCHOOL video! Your children are being introduced to learning situations, not studying for a college exam! We have found that all the Brainy Baby videos are top quality and do an excellent job of teaching. Our boys knew the entire upper /lower case and all the letter sounds around 16-18 months! It was amazing and I KNOW that these videos played a big part in that. I am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers. After doing a little research, I found a little known fact that it was Brainy Baby that created the first set of "infant-preschool" videos over 10 years ago (way before the Einstein series). So, that really gave me confidence that the producers at Brainy Baby really had the experience and track record. My advice, I don't see how you could go wrong for a mere $15 investment in your child's future. I own all of them and wish Brainy Baby would make more!  +dvd
Confusing, too many characters, difficult to follow story line+N+Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.+dvd
A Great Workout+P+This is one of my all-time favorite The Firm tapes. It is a great combination of cardio and strength. The time flys when I'm doing this tape.   I read the reviewer that said that these reviews were not by 'real' people. I'm very real and in NO WAY connected to the Firm company or any of it's affiliates.(sounds like legalize, but it's true). I discovered the Firm a couple years ago and discovered that even though I thought I was in good shape, I was wrong. Firm tapes really put you through the paces. If you really do the tapes and stick with them, you WILL get stronger and feel better. I didn't loose a ton of weight, but I DID get fit enough to be able to do a triathlon this last summer.  I've been doing workouts since before we had VHS tapes (I used audio tapes that came with a poster that showed the moves). I've tried just about every exercise instructor out there. They all have good and bad and so does The Firm. But, all in all, I have to say that the Firm workouts are the hardest, safest, most effective, and most fun I've ever done. +dvd
We Were Robbed!+N+We bought "the series."  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute "movies" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as "The Complete Season!+dvd
The second worst dinosaur movie+N+First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.  The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.  It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.  If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)  If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.  If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'  But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park+dvd
A classic tale of adventure, true love, and REVENGE!+P+When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...   What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...   If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).   Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece "Dance of Curse" for instance. It reminds one a lot of "Duel of the Fates", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode "mystic eyes". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.   Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne. +dvd
Awesome series!!+P+I'm mildly into anime, I only watch the stuff that I really enjoy. This is the only series that has really drawn me in. Usually it's just movies for me but Wolf's Rain is amazing. I can't wait for Volume II to be released on Tuesday! It contains the final episodes (19-30).+dvd
Why do space men get all the fun?+P+This movie is a classic, u have so many great actors in this movie... You know, I loved this movie the first time i saw it as a kid and it was better the seccond time...+dvd
OH, YES... TAKE ME BACK TO '59+P+Yes, please take me back to 1959, to New York in 1959, or even back to Rio de Janeiro, a couple of years before, where I met Rona Jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous "Sacha's" nightclub, where Rona was already drafting her novel mentally... When the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the Seagram's building, one could actually walk-up to lovely Suzy Parker and chat with her about how real was the "new morality" of the liberated New York girls in the executive suites, decades before Sex and the City became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the Sixties. At night we had the many parties thrown by Negulesco and his charming wife, while Stephen Boyd was being charming to my wife, Brazilian actress Mariza Woodward, featured in LIFE Magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in Rio. Oh, yes, take me back! And if you were not there then, if you were not even born then, do get this DVD and visit New York 1959 and see how charmingly it all started, despite where it eventually ended+dvd
Hilarious, inspirational, funny - with a real depth & world-wide appeal!, +P+This movie was superb. I wish it was available in PAL (not just US/Canada's NTSC format). I was both inspired not only with it's hysterical, insightful humour, but with it's global appeal. It brings out themes that EVERYBODY can relate to, not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families, but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes. The movie has great wit and side splitting humour. It's such fun to watch and this man is a star!  He really should be more widely recognised world-wide, a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character.  Time to come and do a show in South Africa too!  What a talent!!!+dvd
John Tucker lives???+N+Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as "Bring it on", "Clueless", "Mean Girls" and, especially the superior "Heathers".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, "John Tucker Must Die" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. "JTMD" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. "Heathers" = 5 stars. "Mean Girls" = 4 stars. "Bring it on" = 4 stars. "Clueless" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that "John Tucker Must Die" doesnt have.. +dvd
Catastronic+P+This musical is riviting. It lets your imagination run wild.  It is something for young and old to enjoy.  A must see+dvd
Feels more like broken glass+N+"Sugar" is an interesting name for this strange, awkward, ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads.  While they carry the film over it's editing, direction, and story hurdles, they can't make up for its unevenness.  Plus the story is entirely too cliche, and I couldn't help thinking it was essentially the same story as "Circuit," albeit in a different venue (except I enjoyed Circuit.)  I couldn't get into this film.  Why not?  The story lurches around and you are left to wonder "why" and "how" altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse.  Something in the description of this film claims it's funny.  I guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny, then you will get a good laugh out of this.  I kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile.  Not so much.  I'd recommend "Circuit" to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines, and I'd leave this film on the shelf.  It's redeeeming qualities are few+dvd
Where's the Light Switch?+N+With the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film "Doom", you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly.  On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of "shoot the mutants", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their "Sarge" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of "The Sphere".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (ï¿½ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in "Doom" defies logic.  To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of "Doom" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.  That alone should tell you how "good" this film is+dvd
Worst video game movie +N+We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief!+dvd
PREPARE TO CRY+P+Im not gonna spoil it for anyone, although some people did already, but the ending was the most saddest thing I have ever seen, I literally couldnt stop crying, but it was so good too, I understand everything better now, if your a big wolfs rain fan and havent watched this, prepare the tissues+dvd
Terrific drumming video+P+I give this DVD an enthusiastic 5 stars.  If you're into Rush at all, or a serious drummer, this is a must have.  It focuses mainly on the art of solo-ing, something Mr Peart does well at, but there's enough material on the 2 discs to keep anyone fan or drummer interested.  Well worth the money. +dvd
Amatuer Camera Man.+N+Love Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience. Parts of Michael's head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off. Most of the time, the camera man didn't expect where Michael was going to move to and you'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture. I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert. That this was just home made videos. This was definitely not worth $20. If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act. Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks. You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael's movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me's DVD. Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better. Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD's and had the word enhanced after it. The DVD that I received was not enhanced. Anyways, skip this one, and get "Caught in the Act" instead. +dvd
Terrible+N+This movie was a complete letdown. They tried to cross Cujo with The Terminator. Interesting concept, but the script completely lacks any real oomph. Awful film. Lance Henriksen deserved better+dvd
Disapointing Action Movie+N+I really like Wesley Snipes and I really like action movies. This movie disappointed on both accounts. I had to wonder what Snipes was thinking in doing this film. I still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters, so why do a straight-to-video movie. Truthfully I didn't even read the cover before renting it because it was Wesley Snipes but even if I did I would have still rented it.  The movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist, which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase. After that, the movie seems to fizzle out.  There is not much dialogue and I think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film. The acting is pretty bad all around, although I think Snipes did what he could with what he as given.  The directing is frazzled and just plain weird. I didn't like it much at all. I think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse.  Given the right attention, this movie could have been great but I get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could. It has potential, but in my opinion, everyone involved in it just fell flat.  I had trouble getting through the whole thing. If you are a die hard Snipes fan then you might want to rent it, but I don't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not. It just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious I have ever seen.  Don't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you've wasted your time watching it. Only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are+dvd
Seinfeld.+P+I love this show.Rated TV-PG for language,some drug use and sexual content.Canada:PG.13 and up.Certain episodes:9 and up+dvd
Robots - Very Rusty and Out of Date+N+This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film+dvd
As awful as it possibly might be+N+And this is from someone who thinks that U2 music and lyrics are in the top echelon of rock music accomplishments, next to those of Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Nirvana. Let me be frank here: these videos, with the exception of Wim's spot and the footage from the 1992 gig, are an evidence of total lack of creativity and spirit. Period+dvd
Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !!+N+This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort.+dvd
Captures the Soviet Cold-War Era Well+P+One of the last great films of the Cold War era made around the time the Berlin Wall fell. The hunt for Red October is classic intrigue and tension of the USSR and USA over dominion of geopolitics. Sean Connery brings back the cool and intense demeanor that made him famous as the original James Bond+dvd
Finally, a worthy DVD edition!+P+Clueless has been released on DVD before, with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features. In 2005, for its 10th anniversary, Paramount finally released a great, if not cheesily named, DVD edition of this 90's teen comedy classic, with such quotable lines as "You're a virgin who can't drive" and "As if!"  The transfer on this DVD is AWESOME. It's very clean, sharp, and clear. I don't remember any issues on the past DVD, but if there were any, it seems like they were cleared up for this release.  The bonus features are likeable fluff, but at least they're existent. Featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members, such featurettes as "The Class of '95," which discusses the cast, and "Language Arts," which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon, allow us to delve, if only just slightly, into the making and the impact of this movie. Also, the trailers from the previous DVD release are included.  Children of the 90's definitely need to own this DVD. Clueless is still a major part of America's pop culture today, and really, who doesn't love watching a 90's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like Jane Austen's Emma+dvd
GREAT SUMMARY OF CORPORATE CRIME+P+Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms.  More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations.  As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike.+dvd
Very Clever, A lot of Fun!+P+Considering I just saw Cars, I wasn't so sure about Over the Hedge.  I mean, Cars actually became one of my favorites after I finished it!  But I gave this a shot and I'm glad I did.  I'll admit, the whole concept of R.J. using the others to repay a debt wasn't very original, but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable.  Now I'm debating whether or not I want to buy it.  I'd say rent it first, but if you have kids, this is a good one for your collection+dvd
The baby-size DVD for weddings+P+I have to qualify this review in that I viewed this DVD that a friend had purchased for themselves; they wanted something that wasn't immensely detailed, and they felt it was a good reference tool for their needs. I had purchased Martha's "Complete Weddings" DVD, so it was an interesting comparison of the two. If you are looking for a brief overview of wedding planning, then this would be a very well-done general reference guide. It will give you an overview of wedding day idea's and will be most helpful.   You get a little bit of flowers, dresses, cakes, atmosphere, etc. so this is an informative, but basic, tool to help you in your plans. The quality of film, sound, and color is superb, as always. She gives her lessons slow enough to take notes, but still with enough information that you feel you have a good hold of the subject.   This is a wonderful choice for the basics of wedding planning, or even for a fancy party. Congratulations on one of the happiest days of your lives!!+dvd
Direct to video potboiler re-tread that never should have been made+N+This direct to video "sequel" is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler, and another of the countless, and pointless, direct to video sequels to come from Sony/Comlumbia/Tri-Star as of late (Cruel Intentions 2 & 3, Starship Troopers 2, shall I go on?).  Wild Things 2 focuses around a rich girl (Susan Ward) whose stepfather mysteriously dies, and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival (Son of the Beach's hot Leila Arcieri) who claims to be the man's true, biological daughter.  Naturally, just like in the original, there are plot twists aplenty, as learned by an insurance investigator (Isiah Washington, giving a somewhat inspired performance), and naturally, there are double crosses, murders, and a redux of the first film's threesome, only it's not as erotic as the original's.  Wild Things 2 isn't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it's good points, it's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate.  Is it worth seeing?  Depends how much you liked the first Wild Things, but for the rest of us, just watch the original and forget this ever happened+dvd
All-time classic social satire+P+I saw Fight Club in the theaters in '99, not knowing anything about Chuck Palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie.  What I saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one *question* life, consumerism and where we're going as a society.  It was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection ("how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight", "if you died right now how would you feel about your life?", the whole Raymond K. Hessel scene); intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi-layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay.  Today, 7 years and several Palahniuk books, Fight Club tee shirts and posters later; after making my Internet banking, credit card, phone, online gaming and ISP logins "Tyler Durden"; after police found a bunch of high schoolers in another county in my state imitating the movie in a local barn when they were busted after coming home to their parents with bloody noses; after several people have read my email addy and quoted the movie or shot back a quick "Heyyy.... A FIGHT CLUB FAN!"- the movie remains needless to say, my all-time favorite.  There is very little grey area with people who've seen it (look no further than the rated reviews here)- most either like it or hate it.  If you're a more intellectual "thinker" and a little graphic violence and foul language doesn't easily offend you, give it a viewing (or read the novel if you're more bookworm than movie buff).  The sign of a good song is that its melody and lyrics stay in your head long after you've finished listening to it.  The sign of a good *movie* is not only that its scenes and classic one-liners from an extremely intelligently-written script replay in your mind because they're just THAT memorable, but that its message is so timely, relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it's still talked about today.  There are message boards on the Net still discussing and debating new talking points about the movie TODAY, 7 years later; there aren't too many other films that have sparked this kind of intelligent, thoughtful and self-exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing.  Some of the more misogynistic scenes ("I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need") are cast in a new light given Palahniuk's recent coming out of the closet, surprising many fans.  On to the DVD itself.  I own many, and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary, Fight Club paraphernelia, a couple hilarious PSA's and a cool music video.  It's considered by many to be one of the most comprehensive DVD's ever produced.  As to negatives: the film has some fairly graphic violence and a great deal of cussing & cursing, the latter of which detracts from a script (IMO).  If you can move past this, get this DVD or at least give it a rent and watch what is destined to be one of the most talked-about classics of all time+dvd
I give it zero stars+N+Complaining, whinning, mumbling, beer drinking, bathtub soaking, unattractive Alison and her overgrown, teenage hairstyled, beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter.  The most horrible series I've seen on TV, in the end Alison seems to "solve" whatever the problem is but it's not worth the watch. No one in my family enjoyes this show+dvd
Convincing and thorough anti-war journalism+P+A revealing examination of the Iraq war, with substantial support from Intelligence and military sources.  It challenges the heretofore accepted accounts that bad intelligence led to the U.S.-led invasion to pre-empt Iraqi WMD deployment.  Chapters are - unfortunately - not provided. +dvd
Assess your own taste before buying+N+I am one of the many reviewers who purchased this DVD because everyone favorably compared it with "Seinfeld," and (not being an HBO subscriber) I had never seen it. Personally, I found this show boring, repetitive, and often grating. Well, that's just me. You might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy. Deciding if this DVD is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste.  Buy this DVD if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters (as in "Married with Children" or Vicki Lawrence's show "Mama").  This is NOT the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in "All in the Family." As in "Seinfeld", you will see adults act in childish, selfish, irresponsible, uncaring ways. Depending on how this is done, it can be VERY funny, but "Curb" missed the mark for me. I find self-absorbed New Yorkers (as those portrayed in Seinfeld) to be funny, but self-absorbed Californians (as in "Curb") are just pathetic, not even laughable. You might feel differently. Neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in "Seinfeld", but almost celebrated in "Curb." The characters in "Seinfeld" are roughly half a generation younger than those in "Curb." The Seinfeld characters (who came of age in the "me" era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life.  The older characters in "Curb," on the other hand, offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life. They merely exist. You might find this funny, but I found it depressing+dvd
Great first Dramatic effort by Tim Meadows...+P+Wow!  Just wow!  I am impressed with this one.  I was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when I first heard about this one, seeing how I normally associate Tim Meadows, with flat, not very funny, comedies, when he stars, and very vague cameo and side roles in other Adam Sandler and Will Ferrel main Headliner movies!   But this one, wow! He is really a talented individual!    I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.  His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.  I also like how this movie, once again paired up Nick Nolte and Mr. Meadows, for the first time since 48 Hours!  Nothing short of brilliance, I say!  While Mr. Meadow's role was much more dramatic in Hotel Rwanda, keep in mind, he did show a sufficient amount of that "angry black" character he is famous for in 48 Hours.  Definitely pick up this movie!  You won't be sorry!  MC White said:  You'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up, and memorize all of the Main Character's names!  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!+dvd
Children Should Beware of Strangers Approaching in Cinema+N+Because some of them are repeat motion picture pedophiles, of a sort; or they exhibit repeat youth stalking and posturing behaviors indicating a suggestive or manipulative inducement scam of industrially applied psychological warfare to goad uninformed youth imprinting boobytraps.  That is the subject of this semiotic critical study.  You know where the exit is if you're not up for it.  Voting buttons are for political circuses, state your own case and leave others unmolested.  The First Amendment is ratified; it is not up for repeal.  Enter:   There is no more need for obsequiously flattering supplications to a menace lurking in our communities, nor the hundredth re-written version of a content synopsis--those forms of reviewing anything are passï¿½ mental laziness playing right into a trap.  There is no such thing as an American idol or icon or celebrity worship.  There is commerce, enticement, inducement and stupidity; and absolutely no curriculum allowed in the schools dealing with the subject of Anti-commercial Thinking Skills for Intellectual Self Preservation and Defense.    If Leni Rifle'nall, subsequent to the destruction of European fascism and its motion picture cameras, had to work under cover still trying to cast the ideological mold for society in the socialistic-fascist agenda, she'd probably be pushed into film projects that use stories and situations in juxtaposition to target children and other sore nerves like mother's and kidnapping... `The Forgotten.'  And she'd probably be in a position of unannounced executive, overriding film directorate to even suggest such crypto-fascists titles; or what would convert into having the ear of those controlling the pool of her pre-selected film scripts and directors in whatever kulture of mass entertainment media manufacture.  Poor animation, bereft of ideas and recycling a lunatic zoo escapade from earlier motion picture non-greatness; for the purpose of Catholic bashing and youth corruption.  Ecstatic performances are actually religion related catharsis, for motion picture redundancy it only amounts to acting out the most, screaming, shouting the most, being the most behaviorally intimating of instability or violence--that whole center of attention, infant terrible prestige and again, involving a `childish fascination with aircraft', motorcycles, airlines like in `The Forgotten', childhood affectations of wealth, intellect and power.  What about this latest ripoff of the movie 'Dog Day Afternoon', also having to import limes and posture a sublime disrespect for Black law enforcement as being at no recognizable `pay grade'?  That's an awfully irritating display of arrogance too, and saying that robbing banks and shooting people is determined solely by the ripe attitude `because I can'.  The public only sees another rotten lime, (TV's "Hell's Kitchen"), in a marvelous artistic achievement for public good, peace and civility--let's give her a hand, to retirement.  Bait unrest, bait contempt, weaken morale, trigger something, anything.  It can still get them while they're young and dumb; ain't that right Columbine?   After school special animation fantasy?  What is the correct genre for this film?  Because it didn't work and whatever interesting acting (at least) there might've been, it's probably a tool for creating the next cipher army of cybernetic John Hinkleys.  Was it on the Larry King interview there was rumor of a film titled `Amanda Plummer'?  Or was that a decidedly misleading invention to hide the Catholic bash in `The secret lives of altar boys?'    Well, we've heard about the scandal surrounding the secret lives of alter boys, but maybe we don't really appreciate how secret their associations can be.  I guess a substantial career in propaganda speaks for itself and only provides test cases for subversion analysis in hazardous media, appliances of mass population psychological operations.  And that is actually more entertaining that viewing any movie completely prone to its presumptive spin-aplomb.  It isn't a big, important celebrity; it isn't a big exciting new picture release; it isn't even a story or film making, it is a method of conditioned response inducement...for statistical confidence interval estimator...neurolinguistic, demographic psychometric programming--exotically scientific and childishly deviant.  That's probably all that the Master Kulture Ultra section of Military Intelligence, or "MI" ever amounted to--the hubris of hitler's photography harlot, and no doubt whole schools of socialistic engineering, just like that childish fascination with aircraft raid on the national budget, absolutely every infernal contraption to stroke the ego of super-genius design engineers with all sorts of Flight Plan(s).  What next, with tens of thousands of high school students failing their graduation exams in every state, not just California; won't the White ethnic esteem have but few historic priding tokens to defend its `superiority'?  Won't the College Republicans at Utah State University toy with students of international and family origins due to their non-Anglo ethnic and language attributes, by inviting them to write an essay justifying scholarship monies set aside for them?  Of course this is happening in America.  It appears the trustees of the edifice have abandoned their little writing-contest darlings at USU, and then encourage them to slander and humiliate people of color in lily White Logan Utah.  Sociologically, the roots of cinematic agitation for White aggression can always be traced back to the weakness to not examine the fault that lies within the self, and not others; to spurn the so called `immigrants' and question the need to recognize their languages, or to complain about the provisions they have made for their children's education.    Motion pictures plied to a chronic genre of population demoralization are an indicator of national subversion for political agendas.  When they manipulate a context of youth development, they are also trying to strike at more susceptible, programmable victims.  Glamorization of violence, mayhem, crime-spree destruction is no more acceptable in video gaming entertainment that they are at the movies, (it's been done till it's being overdone sticks out like the sore thumb it is).  Boycott such movies, burn your copy of them instead of the flag for the evening news cameras; be more critically selective of the means to protest so that it doesn't ring hollow.  Procure movie bills, big and fancy, and symbolically destroy them, even make movies of those effigies and put them on the web.  Fight back.  Evict the deliriously self infatuated, patrician media cast and all its pseudo sophisticated, mundane messages of inhumanity.  They are destroying America, any way they can.     +dvd
Music from The Strokes? No. Interviews? No. Good DVD? No.+N+It's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning. But skip this one. You should be sleeping. I am a die-hard Strokes fan so when New York Stories came out, I had to have it. Much to my disappointment, it turned out to contain no music by The Strokes, or interviews with any members of the band.  If you still feel like you need to see this DVD, don't pay more than $5 for it. You have been officially warned+dvd
"It's the world against us and us against the world!"+P+Oh so dashing Errol Flynn is Peter Blood, a doctor thrown into slavery without just cause.  Fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates!  Arrrrrrrgh!  Highly entertaining from beginning to end, normally when a film gets boring I bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here!  This film didn't let up for a minute.  Even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, who by the way is smoking hot in this movie.  Another reason to get this DVD or even better yet the Flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called "Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born".  Did you know co-star Ross Alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with?!  Yikes.  Also check out the score by Erich Korngold+dvd
The can be written for a Democrat, or Republican+N+For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie+dvd
"Sometimes The God's Bless You In The Morning And Curse You In The Afternoon"+P+I must admit that initially I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.  'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus+dvd
"Gettin' down with the fanny lifter"+P+This is an excellent workout. I love the Firm workouts. I have lost 60 pounds and counting doing Firm workouts 4-5 times a week along with eating a healthy diet. It uses light, medium, and heavy dumbbells, the fanny lifter, and the sculpting stick. Its a cardio + sculpt video. I really enjoy the step aerobics segment. Emily is a great leader. She cues well and she is energetic. This video has an extra long stretching part (i think its about 12 minutes) in the end which is very relaxing and really soothes your muscles after working them so hard in the workout.  Highly recommended+dvd
Great cast lots of fun.+P+This is not high minded viewing but who cares, it's freaking Pirates. It's Johnny Depp being awesome; with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley standing around being hot with occasional spurts of acting. Geoffrey Rush plays the main antagonist and puts out a great performance.  This is one of the coolest adventure films to come out in years. If you like movies like The Mummy and Indiana Jones, or just have an abiding love for kinda corny pirate flicks, then this is right up your alley.  As far as the presentation of the DVD, it's clean and the packaging isn't annoying. The menus dont take a long to cycle so you can just watch your movie and relax. If you are the sort that likes special fearure this is  a good buy since you get a bunch of behind the scenes info and insights into teh making of the film. I am a sucker for behind teh scenes.   Overall a good purchase but it seems to be out of stock as of this review. I am sure you can get it off of the amazon marketplace without too much hassle or just wait for a possible boxed set to release after the sequel DVD(s) comes out or wait for a restock+dvd
Very Namaste+P+I loved Yoga Shakti very much. There were 2 DVDs and a booklet inside the case and the first DVD contained all 4 yoga workouts like Basic Flow, Solar Flow 1, Solar Flow 2 and Lunar Flow. Shiva Rea performs all of these vinyasa flow practices alone on the gorgeous beaches of Maldives'Island and Kerala, India.The extra archival footage included of Indian festivals and practices in temples is also a nice surprise.This DVD is definitely worth every penny.+dvd
This new Deluxe Edition is a disgrace to Sony Home Ent.+N+Yes, indeed! The booklet included is nice and glossy. Thanks! And the two documentaries added this time around are nice too. Thanks again! But what about the film itself? Has that been given the deluxe treatment as well? Sad answer: Definitely NOT! As a matter of fact, this new "re-master" looks much worse than the previous DVD. That one was a very fuzzy non-anamorphic mess, but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy. In fact, when I put the old one in the zoom mode, there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever. And the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition. But worst of all, is that the new DVD is cropped on all four sides! There is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc, especially on top of the frame! So much for a Deluxe Edition! Shame on you, Sony/MGM-UA! Fans of this film - myself included - will have to keep the old DVD, and get this new one for the extras and the booklet. (The 2 stars above are for those inclusions alone.) This is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film+dvd
Memories+P+This is one of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile.  It is a love story, but not your typical love story.  The love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers.  The biggest selling point of the cast is Ms. Rachel McAdams.  I saw her in WEDDING CRASHERS and I've been anxious to see more of her work.  She is gorgeous AND she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie.  I predict her as one of Hollywood's up & coming stars (at least I hope so!).  For a guy whose father suffers from Alzheimers, this movie really hit home.   An interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young (their courtship) and the period of their Golden Years.  This is a must-see movie, even for people who don't normally care for "mushy" movies.  In a single word, this story is unforgettable. +dvd
simply excellent  movie+P+This is my favorite movie. I like it all: screenplay, director, actors, etc. Believe it brilliant+dvd
Too tricky for me+N+I have Jennifer's Crunch Salsa Dancing DVD, and it was my first dance exercise DVD.  I loved it so much I've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor.  I find the moves too difficult and frustrating.  By the time you are close to having one step down, she's moving onto the next one, and it doesn't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that I enjoy in her Crunch video.  In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.  The end result was putting the two combinations together, so basically repeating four moves over and over, doing about six dance routines all together, which was good enough for me.  When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.  She looks great in this video, but I agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all.  Basically I ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles.  But if I was a good dancer, this would probably be a lot of fun.    +dvd
Good Solid Yoga Practice - And Fun!+P+Beginners & Beyond is a wonderful place to start a yoga practice. It's doable yet can be challenging, lots of great instruction, you can do the sets separately when you're short on time or both together for a longer sessions, and it's just plain fun! Even if you are no longer a beginner, like me, I think you will enjoy this.  Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond is one of my favorite, most-used Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's+dvd
"The ratio of people to cake is too big....."+P+...says the mumbling Milton (my favorite character). The characters and their odd mannerisms made this film a success, in my view. One of my coworkers lent me this movie, promising me that I'd like it - he was right. It is both funny and tragic, though a bit exaggerated (but it's a MOVIE, where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic).   Most people can relate to Office Space, even if they don't have a cubicle-based job. I happen to have a cubicle-based job, though I recently moved from a rather large cubicle to an office, which I share with another coworker (there is a gray cubicle wall dividing it). It's not so bad though.  Anyway, the main character, Peter Gibbons, lacks motivation in his career and is fed up with a number of business practices. But he doesn't quit his job - he just stops working.  Doing nothing is his ideal life.  The rap music is a nice touch.  Now back to my favorite character, Milton, who repeatedly says that he "could set the building on fire" whenever things get too rough.  He is pathetic yet likeable, and I felt sorry for him when he didn't get any cake at the party. Everyone keeps passing it around, and he watches the cake get smaller and smaller until it is completely gone. And his desk is moved numerous times, which really irritates him. Eventually, he moves down to the basement, where it is dark and lonely.  His boss comes down to ask him to kill the cockroaches ("That would be terrific"), even though it's not Milton's job.  His distinctive "Excuse me..." protests are rarely heard. He is being used by the company, no one respects him, no one listens to him.  I'd burn the building down too+dvd
BIBLE SERIES BOX SET+P+VERY SATISFIED. USUALLY BIBLE MOVIES ARE VERY POOR IN ACTING,ETC.  THESE WERE VERY WELL PRODUCED AND HAD SOME FAMILIAR ACTORS. THE MOVIES SEEMED TO STAY WITH THE BIBLE+dvd
It was what I expected+P+I purchased this DVD set in 2001 and found it to be quite good, just I was a little disappointed with the Genesis DVD because it was not a movie and they could of done a movie instead of a documentary.+dvd
Very sub-standard Wilbur Smith Lite+N+The only good thing in this movie is Jolene Blalock as a femme fetale. The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.  Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows+dvd
Can I give it 6 Stars? +P+An outstanding animated comedy, Hoodwinked, brings to the screen a "different" take on the well-known Little Red Riding Hood story.  In addition to the "traditional" company of adorable characters from the classic fairy tale, the cherry on the cake has to be the hilarious and hyperactive squirrel. Anne Hathaway, James Belushi, Glenn Close, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of providing high quality entertainment the likes of which we don't get to see often enough.   The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music are all wonderful! In short, Hoodwinked is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with Shrek and Shrek 2.+dvd
the fun is stealthiest of all...+N+They call it brainless fun, but it's not even fun.  Yes, "Stealth" is that not-rare-enough bad movie that's actually so bad, it's no fun.  It starts out bad from the beginning - with an on-screen title sequence dating this film "In the Near Future", which should trip alarms for anybody whose ever watched an episode of "Mystery Science Theater 3000".  The heroes of our story - three pilots assigned to fly hyper-tech US fighters called "Talons" - are reluctantly joined by a fourth pilot, a robotic fighter jet called EDI.  Trouble starts immediately when EDI develops an acute case of self-awareness and faster than you can say "I'm sorry Dave, I really can't do that", EDI is ignoring orders and raising all sorts of havoc.  It's hard to get more specific without ruining the plot...because there really isn't any plot.  The story we see on the screen hints at several different plot-ideas that never form into a single story - we have the plot about stopping "Crazy EDI"; the plot about the evil admiral played by Sam Shepard who will do anything he can to keep the lid on EDI when he goes bad; we have Jessica Biel as a fighter pilot running from the bad guys after she's shutdown over North Korea; then we have Josh Lucas as the other Talon pilot whose on the run from some goons who are trying to...Oh, who cares?  None of these plots go anywhere.  BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM EFFEX?? "Stealth" offers us hours of aerial dogfighting in unsurpassed CGI - unsurpassed because the movie demonstrates that there are some things that simply can't be left to computer animation.  Even though they're next generation aircraft, the F/A-37 Talon fighters never convincingly look like any airplanes, and the aerial effects here look little more believable than those done over 20 years ago in "Firefox" or "Deal of the Century", or nowadays on any flight simulator game run on any desktop-PC.  The effects compound the error by maximizing use of "impossible shots" - shots that couldn't be seen by a human perspective, such as those that cut across the sky and directly inside the subject aircraft - it's a clever shot, but not a terrible smart one (they never stop reminding us that these are effects).  It's probably too much effort to explain that even elite fighter pilots don't want to be confused by a flight panel that suddenly starts broadcasting real-time images of a bunch of terrorists sitting down as if for a CNN foto-op, or that none of the pilots come off as even casual aviators.  "Stealth" is one of those mindless movies that effete snobbish reviewers like to blame on teenage boys, but this flick lost a ton of money (stealthy profits) which is only strong proof that the monster audience of mindless boys is itself a delusion of these frustrated critics and studio execs, or even stronger proof that those mindless teenage boys may be smarter than anybody realizes+dvd
Great show.  Terrific plot and action.+P+Very entertaining.  You can find some plot faults but at the end of the day this is simply good entertainment for those of us that like fast moving shows and like to see the good guys win+dvd
The Capriciousness of Life+P+Rarely has a film drawn me in so deeply that I remain affected days after I viewed it. "The Son's Room" is profound in its ability to create its moods especially in the latter half of the film. I feel that the director's presentation of this happy family, in the film's first half, is what allowed me to feel the result of an impending tragedy so personally. I kept thinking that I wanted everything to go back to the way it was before. I  shared their grief as if it was my own.  I also applaud the presentation of an Italian society which is unlike the comic opera Italian experience presented in American films over the past decades going back to the silent era. The film may not affect you as deeply as it affected me, but I highly recommend the absorbing story that is presented. +dvd
European Arthouse Movie Par Excellence+P+"Intimacy" is sexually explicit and raw, as one would almost expect from a European "art-house" movie. The sex scenes aren't really the focal point of the movie -- it merely establishes the setting for our protagonists, Jay and Claire. The story becomes quite intriguing as Jay decides that he wants more than just anonymous weekly romp with Claire. Acting by Timothy Spall is excellent as usual. He is awesome in serious roles+dvd
stupid bunny+P+wow this movie blew me away, i saw it with a mind set that i was gonna hate but i didnt it was really good, and it had some comedy in it as well. now there are a few part that are a little cheap but its a fine damn movie. besides what other movie has a giant bunny+dvd
A nice mental exercise for geeks+P+I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't "get it" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.   That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally "get it", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it+dvd
cool+P+the movie the players club is a cool movie because it tell the  story of a girl trying to make her dream come true even though she hates working at the strip club "the players club" she does it anyway i rate this movie 5 stars because it shows a girl that want to make her dream of becoming a newsreporter come true and this movie should have a second part to it +dvd
fun for the whole family!+P+Dan Zanes has written catchy music, and the videos are really fun.  My 3 year old toddler really enjoys them when he sees them on Disney, so we bought this DVD.  While the concert portion isn't that great (he got bored), the videos were for songs we'd not seen and he will ask for  "Dan Zanes" so we'll put the DVD in and sing, dance and just have fun with it+dvd
Oh my, what an inexcusable fiasco from universal!+N+When I received this for Christmas the year of its release, I was unaware of the framing issues.  I had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements.  On top of that, there were warbling sound issues with part 2, and the Michael J. Fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu.(This was reported on many websites)  Also, the trailers were all full screen, not widescreen.  Apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release.  The thing that angers me the most is that since I couldnt return part 1 to universal initially, ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen....ughhhh.  I can live with it in fullscreen and I am not gonna exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with Universal.  Thanks for nothing......pass this one up until its reissued with new features!+dvd
This just didn't do it for me+N+Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect+dvd
michael moore shoots himself in the foot+N+as usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, &c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution.+dvd
Too many changes+N+I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes.  However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly.  There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new.  Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind.  However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos.  This one is just collecting dust for me right now.  Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it+dvd
Superb value package+P+If Bette Davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of Hollywood in the Golden Era, she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent. This set, compared to Volume One, which contains obvious Davis hits, covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962. Two favourite Davis films, "The Man Who Came to Dinner" and "Marked Woman" are included.    More detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary:  - "Marked Woman" is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated.  This was the first film Davis made after she walked out of Warner Brothers and was sued for breach of contract.  She lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect. She gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending. - "Jezebel" is the 1938 film for which Davis won her second Oscar, a precursor to "Gone with the Wind" and directed superbly by William Wyler.  The film is a soap opera about a willful Southern girl and would fall into trivia without Davis's subtle performance and Wyler's attention to detail. - "Dark Victory" from 1939 was possibly Davis's favourite role about a Long Island socialite with a brain tumour. The film is a tour de force for Davis who might have won another Oscar if the film had been released in a different year. - "The Man Who Came to Dinner" is an ensemble piece, an excellent version of the 1941 Kaufman and Hart Broadway Hit.  Davis supports Monty Woolley, a character based on Alexander Woolcott, who hilariously dominates the film. - "Old Acquaintance" from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman's picture with Davis starring with rival Miriam Hopkins.  It is a picture which resonated with "woman's issues" in 1943 and was remade in the 80's as "Rich and Famous". - "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is the famous teaming with Joan Crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult (and camp) classic. The film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows.  The extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably, although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about Davis's overanalysed relationship with Joan Crawford. Best of all, the excellent documentary "Stardust: The Bette Davis Story" has been included.  The Collection is great value+dvd
Beautiful Film+P+Most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but I wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is.  I am a long time U2 fan and had seen Rattle and Hum, but didn't get around to purchasing the DVD until late 2005.  The fact that the music is wonderful is a given, but the cinematography is just astounding.  I love how you get to see everything from every point of view.  You get to see what the band sees on and around the stage, including the breathtaking sea of fans.  You get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes.  You get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on.  And of course you get the passionate music.  The film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to.  I couldn't ask for more+dvd
A CARBON COPY OF I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...+N+Boring and like most every other new horror movie. Lame mask,I think the awful movie Cut used this mask also,who cares I suppose. This goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies(Scream,I Know What You Did,Valentine,Urban Legend,Cut etc..) so bottom line don't waste your time,stick with 80's Slashers+dvd
MUCH better than expected+P+After reading the reviews I thought the DVD was going to be horrible, but it's actually pretty good, and so far one of the best instructional hip-hop videos I've seen (I own a Groovaloos DVD and Tina Landon DVD and have used Darrin's Dance Grooves), and the instruction is also better than some teachers I've taken classes from.    In general, nothing beats actually having a good teacher and choreographer so they can critique your form and technique.  However, I very happy that the instructor, Dave Scott, DID give some tips on technique instead of only showing moves to copy.  (The fundamentals section is too short, but pretty good).  I only wish he gave more tips on technique.  He also breaks down routines at different tempos (which most instructional videos do not do), and this is essential!  I think it's important to get the fundamental moves right at a slower tempo first, rather than rushing through the movements just to get through the song.    He does turn around from the camera a few times so you can follow the moves without confusing your left and right, but I wish he did that more.    The only main problem I had is that there are only two real routines you can learn, and that's it's not very "Take it to the Streets" oriented.  No breakdancing instruction, really, or street dancing tips.  So if you want to improve your breakdancing, this isn't the best DVD to buy.  Overall, it's a good DVD for the price and I would highly recommend for intermediate to advanced dancers looking to expand creative moves, improve their ticking/waving, and get ideas for choreography.  For beginners, it would still be a good investment but will be fairly difficult.  I would suggest that instead of matching the moves, it might be good to just mirror the instructor so you can at least get used to moving your body in certain ways. +dvd
It's all about Halle Berry...+P+A very good film, Swordfish, brings to the screen the story of hacker who is hired by the underworld to break a bank code resulting in the release of millions of dollars.  Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS!), John Travolta and the rest of the cast, carry out their performances very well.  The highlight of the movie has to be Halle Berry's nude scene at the pool. In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! Swordfish is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!+dvd
Disappointing+N+I have to say that I was disappointed with this DVD.  The variety of dance styles it shows is nice, but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful.  I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only DVD I've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style, which I've become interested in lately+dvd
Embarrasing+N+Whilst I do like Jessica and Nick, (I was a fan of Jessica since "I'm gonna love you forever" and I always liked 98degrees), this is embarrasing.    On Newlyweds, I think she's actually funny.  I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about.  This however was different.  I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON"T DO THIS AGAIN.  I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face.  It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.    Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,?  I was cringing considerably+dvd
The Dreamers+N+Despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie, this is really pretty sick stuff, with little or no redeeming social context.  Objectively, sick just isn't erotic, no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so.  Those who think differently really ought to either:  (a) focus a little more; (b) examine their true motives; or (c) get a life+dvd
DINOSAUR LONGEVITY AND SCIENTIFIC FACT+P+The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
A truly amazing film+N+This movie is a classic in terms of jaw-droppingly honest self-aggrandizement.  If you took everything out of an early 80's Woody Allen film EXCEPT the repugnant parts, you'd get "Fall," and it's made me a devoted Eric Schaeffer fan.  What's so amazing about it all is the sheer self-centered wish-fulfillment that Schaeffer indulges in.  It's so cool!  Every single character in the movie exists only as a vehicle to convey to his character how incredibly great he is -and why not?!  He has two female friends who we know almost nothing about except that they're constantly impressed with his life and abilities as a lover.  He's got the supermodel lover who ultimately dumps him only because he's TOO cool, too hot, too real for her.    I'm not kidding.  You must see this.  Then there's the sex.  Schaeffer's character (who, like Shaeffer, is a NYC cab driver who had an affair with a married supermodel who ultimately dumped him) is so amazingly incredible as a lover that he makes his supermodel climax WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  If that's not cool enough, his two lady friends then spend time marveling at this, about how great it is that he did that WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  Wow!  Later, she actually  violates HIM with the aid of a toy, but once again it's HER who climaxes, thanks to his incredible dirty-talk and overall amazingness.  This guy's a dynamo, and thankfully there isn't a frame of the film that isn't devoted to showing that or having one of the other characters tell him that.  As I said, he gets dumped eventually, just like in real life.  But Schaeffer wants us to know the truth, that it's because he's too great and she's ultimately too shallow and loves him too intensely.  Schaeffer even imagines his lover's husband as a sexless idiot and gives him the line "Maybe I'm shallow and superficial, but..."  The husband then goes on to acknowledge that he can't compete with whoever this incredible lover-man is, but that he'll "be there" if she changes her mind and chooses the shallow, easy path.  Eric's "character" is just THAT good.  For anyone who, like me, lives in a world where the only obstacles are the fact that some people resent how incredible I am and that the world revolves around me instead of them... this movie is for US+dvd
I didn't like it.+N+I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch.  It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film.  The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments.  It is not a movie I would readily recommend+dvd
Enjoyed It+P+I actually liked this movie and I don't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie I don't know. Anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay. I am not going into the movies detail because I don't want to ruin the story for somebody. I will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all. Rent it then maybe buy it if you like it+dvd
Shall We Dance DVD+P+This is the way more movies should be made! It shows excellent talent, has a lot of humor and is super intertaining. And under it all are some great lessons in curtesy, honesty and ethics! I feel good after viewing it+dvd
Change of heart  . . .+P+This is a gently heartbreaking film set in Tehran, a city flooded with Afghan refugees during the time of Taliban rule in their homeland. It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.  The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor. Recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media+dvd
great movie, people should stop complaining+P+If you have never seen this movie, see it now.  Its a thoughtfull and intriguing view of the computer industry from its roots to now.   Sure, some things might have been cut, but if you are like me and have never seen it before, its still a great film.  great interviews and funny commentary, and no obvious axe to grind, I highly recomend it+dvd
The Salton Sea+P+Starts off slow but makes up for it in the end.  It is a really great story.  Val Kilmer does a great job (as usual)+dvd
And who could that be stalking us now?+N+Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.  I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort  normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.      Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality.   +dvd
Worst movie I've ever seen+N+I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films+dvd
3rd once and again+P+i wish that there would come out with the 3rd season of once and again i just love that show soooo much. i wish it was still on tv+dvd
Haunted Castle (3-D) +P+This dvd is more like an experince/ride, that can be enjoyed over and over the story is good and the visuals are incredible cgi, Imax does not skimp on the wow factor. I own several 3d movies and this is my favorite. For the best experiance in projecting shutter Glasses movies use a LCD projector not a DLP Projector+dvd
Very funny over-the-top LDS Humor+P+I was very surprised by some of comments by those who gave negative reviews. This is a comedy and it was meant to be over the top. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, many of us have met folks who approach both ends of the spectrum presented by the two main characters. This fact and similar stereotypes are what make these two caricatures so funny. My wife and I were rolling during several of the scenes. Better than some LDS movies (RM, It's Latter-day Night), nearly as good as others (God's Army, Singles Ward, Saints and Soldiers), it's worth a view if you want to have a good laugh+dvd
Fun interviews, but NO song shown in entirety+N+Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today. They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?  After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song.  However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.    The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.  Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.  Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.  Update 6/14/05:  Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band. +dvd

I love David Cross but+N+this movie was kinda boring. Not enough of Cross' standup. Also when there was footage of his stand up, it wasnt that funny+dvd
Roaring biplane blast from the past!+P+My father took me to see this movie when I was a child of about six or seven.  Actually, he wanted to see it and he had to take me along.  I didn't remember the plot, but I remembered the scenery and the music and the cool biplanes and dogfights.  So, I finally bought this movie so I could watch it as an adult.  I can empathize with those who say this movie is too long and moves too slowly.  That said, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  The airplanes are amazing.  Where did they get all these biplanes from?  The only other movie I've seen that has such authentic looking biplane dogfights is "Wings", and that was made back in the 1920's when biplanes were all over the place.  The soundtrack by Jerry Goldmith fits the movie perfectly and adds mood where appropriate.  I loved the "intermission".   It reminded me of a time when a movie was a real event.  Movies were so long that the movie itself gave you a break to use the bathroom.  I saw this movie in a theater that was designed to allow perhaps a thousand people to watch a single movie on a huge screen, not some modern "plex" theater that has twelve little rooms where you can pay to see a movie with a bunch of strangers a few months before it's out on DVD.  So, it moves a little slowly by today's standards, but it's epic, and it's interesting to watch Peppard's character slowly alienate himself from his squadron, and his lover, so that at the end they kill him off by giving him the "privelege" of flying an experimental aircraft. +dvd
O V E R L O N G +N+I continue to be astounded at how carelessly Amazon reviewers throw around their 5 star ratings.  This movie is overlong and not especially comedic or romantic.  The main character (or the actress who plays her anyway) is appealing, but her motivations to start a new life aren't convincing or justified.  Her "romance" with the waiter is ludicrous and the ending is contrived and predictable.  It actually took me 3 days to see the ending because I just didn't have the patience to view this from beginning to end in one sitting.  IF you are a patient, die-hard romantic with 2 hours to kill, I guess you might enjoy it.  I am not and I did not+dvd
Man,this movie sucks.+N+Don't believe the hype. This movie sucks. Nothing happened. The ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then,then the movie ended. I'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects. I actually think that the so called low buget 1980s movies look a lot more realistic than todays CGI. But I just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made. I imediately reconized it as a sound I used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad+dvd
I'm embarassed+N+I am embarassed to admit that I saw this video several years ago; I give it 2 stars.  I suppose the film quality is excellent, but in my opinion, a waste of film to make this.  The plot is forgettable, and, at the risk of offending those who like it, "I spent two hours out of my life watching this, and can't get them back again for something constructive.+dvd
Ken Park how not to make a movie+N+Larry Clark reminds me of a lot   Let's take a look at his pathetic resume shall we:  *Kids-Yes another soft porn film involving Kids.  *Bully- This movie should be when "White Trash attacks". Bully featured mundane acting, the most UNLIKABLE characters ever to put on screen, stupid characters, a "twist" that aint really a twist, awful camera shots and angle and a "gay bull". Nuff said.  *Teenage Caveman-Subpar sci-film.  Now we get to Ken Park, probably the most revolting  story of Clark's kids trilogy if you will.  These kids special? Please give me a break. I don't call killing your neighbors or grandparents, special.  Doing drugs makes you special? Funny I thought that made you a druggie and a loser.  There is no smoothness or observation or anaylsis of the kids from any sort of rhetorical view. Anyone who who seeks to compare this to classic shows like Family Ties, or My So Called Life isn't fooling anyone.  One key difference, the kids in so called life, knew they were troubled, lost and asked for help. The teens in "Ken Park" could give a crap if they live or die, their days are spent on drug binges, fornicating with the friends and in some cases, their friend's mother.   Really it doesn't get anymore revoling that Larry Clark.  None of the characters in the movie can be considered, weak, inept, pathetic, loony comes to mind but far from being strong.  Softcore and hardcore pornograpy seem to be what the filmmaking is echoing nothing else, the other reviews even the most positive ones can ignore that.  There is no reality with these kids, they live in their violent world and heaven forbid if you try to take them out of it.  Clark is not anybody's master of art, if you're art is hardcore pornography, mixed in with convulted storyline , with no rolemodels, no point and weak characters then people need to pick up a dictionary or read actual definitions of art.  The movie is nothing more than tour de force of obscene garbage that should be flushed down the toilet.  Seeing at the reception Clark has received over the year, it's great that fans are starting to see what he really is just a perverted old man , nothing else.  Even then his movies make him look even more pathetic. +dvd
early Cardigans concert on an amazing DVD!+P+On the DVD First Band on the Moon Been It - US promo video Interactive picture gallery  Synopsis Swedish indie pop combo the Cardigans deliver a stellar performance for their British fans in this performance video. The Cardigans: Live in London was recorded during a concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire in late 1996, as the group were touring in support of their breakthrough album, First Band on the Moon. The 16-song set includes "Lovefool," "Rise and Shine," "Your New Cuckoo," "Nasty Sunny Beam," "Never Recover," and more+dvd
just great fun+P+Rick Moranis is adoreable, Steve Martin is appropriately sleazy, and Ellen Greene is a most unlikely heroine.  Taken as a whole, this movie is wonderful...charming even.  A definite must have for anyone who enjoys all things quirky but sweet+dvd
ugly american revisited+N+If cruelty, sadism, and abuse are to your taste, then this is the film for you.  It is a full-length feature expanded from the bucolic short film, 'Fishbelly White', but which contains none of its lyricism and rural poetry.    Duncan is a 14-year-old misfit known for the chickens that he cares for like pets.  He is isolated and lonely because his mother has just died, and his mono-syllabic father ignores him.  And, in keeping with a time-honored cinematic cliche (starting with `Tea and Sympathy'), he is teased, tortured, and threatened by his macho peers for being 'different'.  It seems that he may have a friend in leader-of-the-pack Perry but this is where the two versions part company.  In the short, they develop a lovely, understated homoerotic romance.  Here, Perry is violent and brutal, like his abusive father, ultimately instigating Duncan's final humiliation.   There is not one moment of tenderness in the entire film until the final 'reconciliation' between Duncan and his father but, considering the unrelenting nastiness which has come before, it feels highly contrived.  Duncan is such a willing, unquestioning `victim' throughout the film, any resolution-of-conflict which might have raised this to a true coming-of-age story is lost.  This is a surprising entry from the usually gay-friendly Showtime Network.  There is nothing friendly about this one.+dvd
Self Promotion for Producer.+N+Nothing but self-important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age, as mere snipnets of what I thought was going to be a movie were shown. Very disappointing, as listing didn't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped+dvd
Great Workout+P+This is a very fast paced workout.  It took a couple of times through to learn the routine.  Denise doesn't cue all that well.  She's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement.  Most people don't like that about her, but I think she is motivating.    You definitely work all muscle groups and you'll be sweating with this workout.  I'm tired, but invigorated by the end.  I enjoyed this workout a lot+dvd
Its a heartbreaker.+N+This extremely expurgated version sells for about a dollar a minute! So if you think a 15 minute (estimate) feature is worth the price, by all means, buy this. If not, save yourself the heartbreak I suffered+dvd
Here Is A Classic!+P+In the midst of Widower (Mortician?) (Colin Firth), Cedric Brown's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny, hairy warts and all. With her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth, she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane. If childrearing were this easy, us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick! (I noticed Emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere). Can I please borrow it, Ms. Thompson?   My daughter and I were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself, Emma Thompson. It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her?   Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed.  Beware of dark undertones if you're wary of witchcraft. This review refers to the DVD+dvd
Bridges of Madison County DVD+N+The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault).  I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed.  It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing.  The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open.  But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house.  That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case.  Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you.  The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little+dvd
A must-have and must-see+P+If I had to choose ONE movie to show and teach students the secrets of great actors-directing, it would be this one. The destiny of Peter Bogdanovich is amazing: celebrated as one of the world's best directors in the early 70s, he fell into disgrace because of private problems in the 80s, and rarely got a chance to direct anymore except for TV. Somehow it reminds me of the destiny of Wim Wenders, also celebrated as the new big thing in the 70s, and much disregarded today. Both judgements were excessive. They probably weren't the best directors in the world in the 70s - but surely aren't the worst today.  This movie is a little, much under-rated and overlooked, certainly humble and understated gem. Bogdanovich shows here what it means to direct actors in a way that enhances their performances and brings out deep emotions. This is not a superficial movie. Instead, it is one that bears repeated viewings. And it has much of what life has: truth, emotions, changes. I especially like the ending. It seems to get back to the beginning, but it's not. Somehow, everything is there, but everything has changed forever. It's a happy ending, but bittersweet too. And like real life, it goes on, on a road where you can't follow, just like those friends you had and never met again, or just like your past memories.  I've been waiting for a decade to get a dvd of this movie. And I bought it immediately as it came out, because it is really unsure that they may ever reprint this once the first bunch is gone. So get it, don't miss it, this is the best advice I can give. Don't miss the experience of this movie. This is no special fx movie. This is actors cinema at its best. Something rare+dvd
Femme Fatales or Very Lame?+N+Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid+dvd
the name says it all+N+this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american+dvd
Quack,Quack!+N+"The Hospital" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character.  The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller.  The medical profession can be lampooned but don't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film+dvd
Very Impressive DVD+P+I had always wanted to try Pilates, but was intimidated by the thought of actually trying some of the exercises that I've seen people doing. I hurt my left knee 3 years ago and have a hard time walking and sitting for any length of time. Well, I had a hard time. I have been using this dvd for 2 months now, and can do all the beginner's exercises, even the ones I thought I couldn't do. I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment and sense of well-being that I get from the program. The instructor is laid back, pleasant, and offers helpful hints. You can actually see what she is doing at all times, and she explains things very well+dvd
very well done+P+I really enjoyed this concert DVD. The sound is excellent. The performance is mesmerizing; it was one hell of a show.  Occasionally, I was a little distracted by the post production editing which detracted from the show. That is my one complaint.  I'm not familiar with all the artists that assisted with the show, but I am assuming it was a huge A-list of Hip Hop stars.  I would definitely see the Gorillaz in concert after watching this DVD+dvd
SNEEZES, SEX AND HAM AND CHEESE ON RYE+P+This is a deliriously silly little movie, but it's fun to watch.  Kim Basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human, from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo.  Basinger's comic timing carries the movie, and even the usually disposable Dan Aykroyd's performance is comic and he and Basinger have a good chemistry.  There are some delightful sequences, e.g., when Kim has to discover how to kiss, her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses, and when she has to have sex, she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all.  Jon Lovitz is around for comic relief as Aykroyd's bachelor brother, and it's all mindless nonsense; it's also quite entertaining.  Basinger is a blast+dvd
Yet another DVD I got for Christmas!+N+Where my gifter managed to get an original and brand new copy of this one I have no idea, the bottomline is that it is now part of my collection and I am here to say what I think of it.  It could have been improved.  It's major flaw other than the relatively crude animation is the characters, rather unlikeable heroes and hilarious villains that you strongly wish would win in the end since they are more likeable than those known as heroes.  The story doesn't change much from scene to scene, 15 dalmatian puppies have been kidnapped and must find their way home by going from place to place avoiding Cruella DeVil and her henchmen.  Recommended?  Not really, it has it's moments of warmth, but otherwise, it isn't one of Disney's greatest films+dvd
dream police+P+One of the most fun-loving, infectious bands to ever walk the earth delivering a fine performance to their home crowd. I skipped a star because a band of this stature deserves the BEST in sound quality for any DVD they release (and so do their fans.)+dvd
Thoroughly Modern Millie+P+What a great Movie!!  Loved it back then, love it more now!! A great addition to my collection!+dvd
A sweet story that pulla at the heart strings+P+Calling all "black sheeps of the family" - it is never too late for your family to come around.   In this simple yet powerful story, April and her mother learn that sometimes, those we have the most conflict with are those who are MOST like us.  Painful as it seems, we must all come to terms with dissapointment and overcome our personal fears of rejection when revealing our true selves.  +dvd
Bad spot on dvd+N+We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well.  thanks for asking  pgammon+dvd
Coen Brothers do it again+P+it never ceases to amaze me how the Coen brothers make me love movies from genres that i don't usually like. take this film for instance, its been out for six years, when it came out i said it looks dumb, i don't like stories about hillbillies, but thats not what it is at all, its actually a great film with all kinds of twists and turns. in a word it can be described as delightful, with the most fun part of o'brother being that it keeps you guessing throughout, just when you think one thing is going to happen, bam, supprise, something else. i really enjoyed the music too, i can't get that damn soggy bottom boys song outta my head, and i doubt you'll be able to either. my only regret is that i was to ignorant to watch it sooner, i hope you really enjoy this film as much as i did.+dvd
Not for the average dog owner+N+Sorry - But this video is not for the average dog owner! If you identify with the punk rock scene and are looking for an alternative to the standard dog training video then this might work for you.  This video shows basic training techniques, but the narrator's "voice over" distracts from the actual training process going on. The korny doggy-do and doggy-don't skits attempt to show the viewer correct training techniques and obvious training mistakes,but are a waste of time.Maybe worth $8 but definitely not the $22.95 price tag. I would return it if not for amazon's return policy against returning opened videos+dvd
How are people rating this 5 stars+N+I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good. +dvd
Can I go lower than 1 star?+N+Dear Amazon, don't ever recommend ANY grateful dead to me ever! I consider it an insult to my undeniably good taste in music and movies and the like. I tried to step outside myself and tried to understand why this "band" is so goddamn popular, and I still gladly don't get it. The worst part is I saw stupid jerry on some documentary on IFC and I enjoyed what he was playing, but this grateful dead? They're boring! Not mellow, boring!! Their is a difference+dvd
Watch Das Boot instead+N+I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot+dvd
Too fast+N+I have always like Denise Austin, however; this was tape was way too fast for a beginner.  I thought it was for beginner and on up.  Denise went way to fast and she did not explain the poses at all.  I will not be using this tape.  I was disappointed because normally I love her videotapes and her. +dvd
Worst Movie Ever Made+N+Self indulgent, purile, child-like, pure unadulterated garbage of the highest order.  A truly horrible movie. +dvd
TERI HATCHER NAKED? BIG DEAL - WHERE'S THE CURVES?+N+She's built like a 12-year-old boy... give me Vida Guerra anyday+dvd
What Were They Thinking?+N+Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!  I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.    Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad+dvd
I Liked It...Just Not as Much as Everyone Else Does.+P+"The Searchers" is considered by many to be a masterpiece of both the Western genre and of movies in general. It's even on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#96). I liked the film; It's got a lot of good things about it, but one thing I look for in a film to really call it "Great" is entertainment. The movie is entertaining, but a movie on that same list that's a few notches below it ('Unforgiven') was a much better movie; Both as a film and as entertainment. Anyway, I've seen over a thousand movies and have somehow never seen a John Wayne film. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier who shacks up with his brother and his family. After they're all killed and his two nieces are kidnapped, Ethan sets out on an obsessive quest to get them back. One of the nieces is found dead soon after and the rest of the film is about them trying to find the living one Debbie (Natalie Wood). Along with him is Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter), a man Ethan doesn't really like. Ethan hates indians and Martin is 1/8 Comanche. Early in the film, you find out that Ethan actualyl saved Martin when his family was killed by indians and gave him to his brother and his brother's wife. Even though he seems disagreeable, it sounds like Ethan's quest in honorable enough. But, you'd be wrong. He's not out to save Debbie, but to kill her. When people are kidnapped by the indians, they pretty much become one...And Ethan can't have that. The movie takes place over a long time span and there were times that, I thought, the movie seemed longer than it was. The film has beautiful cinematography though, especially when you consider that the film was released in 1956. John Wayne's performance is very good and, you find later, multilayered. Having read about the film a little bit, I found that it inspired movies like Taxi Driver and even the Buddy Holly song "That'll Be the Day" (which is a line Ethan frequently says). I should make this clear that I'm not a huge fan of classic westerns, so that may have something to do with my view of the film. I know that certainly not everyone will agree with me about it. But I can say this. If you're a big fan of Westerns and/or John Wayne. You'll probably like this movie.   GRADE: +dvd
Rattle, Hum & Chill Out+P+I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now.  Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie.  Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the "holy lands" of rock.  If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it.  Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland.  Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written.  By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career.  Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage.  Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride.  It's only rock'n'roll+dvd
A Film For Those Who Believe In "The One True Love"+P+To appreciate this story, you have to believe that two people can meet and quickly fall forever into forbidden love. That is what is at the heart of this film. If you can't accept that premise, the movie simply does not work. And what makes it throb with life for me are the excellent performances of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us along. Paltrow and Eckhart are a secondary love story here, but you never feel that they really care for one another. Worth your time if you are a romantic. OK, I'm a romantic. Sue me+dvd

Excellent doc about an amazing photographer+P+This is an incredible documentary. A must for anyone interested in photojournalism as well as all those truly interested in world peace. A calm, thoughtful photographer continually stepping into dangerous and tragic circumstances and capturing for us and humanity glimpses of the horrific reality of war that are so often and increasingly ignored by the mainstream press in favor of superficial entertainment.+dvd
Jennifer Aniston saves the day....again!+N+Along Came Polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely Jennifer Aniston makes this film almost worth while. I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon. I recommend The Good Girl or Reality Bites instead+dvd
Anti-Southern Propaganda+N+This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."  If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."    Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005.+dvd
Okay+N+I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.  +dvd
The Story of the World's Most Famous Disco+P+In the mid to late 1970s, disco music was king and everyone enjoyed going to the clubs and dancing the night away.  In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.  Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.  Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.  Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a "consultant" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.  Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.    This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.  Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.  This movie shows both the bright and dark sides of the famous disco.  I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a child of the 70s like me, then you'll remember the disco music and the almost surreal essence that 54 had.  Watch this movie and enjoy a trip back to when disco ruled and 54 was the place everyone wanted to go+dvd
Wa Hoo+P+Longer ago than I care to remember I had the great fortune to meet Einstein.  I was an under grad in college when he made one of his unannounced visits to the campus.  Walter Matthau captures the professor briliantly and his humor and wit come through in this film. Einstein's interest in motorcycles and his love of sailing are portrayed lovingly and the very human side of the great man is illustrated with fidelity and humor. It is always on my list of ten favorite films.+dvd
A Must Have!!+P+We LOVE this whole series of DVD's.  Our 13 month-old son never watches TV at home, but on long car trips, these are life savers!  The music is beautiful and soothing and the images are great.  He loves the "real" pictures of children, animals, and nature scenes.  We received the "God of Wonders" as a gift, and have since purchased the other two.  These are a great alternative to the Einstein videos if you want Christian music along with the videos+dvd
A romantic/emotional roller coaster+P+Why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line, I praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between Hemmingway and Agnes.  All correspondence was done through letters between them after Hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters Hemmingway wrote Angus since a later boyfriend of Angus destroyed all of Hemmingway's letters in a jealous rage.  If there was in final face to face meeting, both their lives may have very different.  More than likely the two would have continued far different lives together.  Hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and Agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to, or a European whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages Hemmingway went through.  Although a bit contrived from reality; the story line does make an impact emotionally.  In my opinion though Sir Richard Attenborough should have had his lead actors at least read A Farewell to Arms before attempting their roles.  It might have helped out with acting that was a little flat and emotionless at times like they didn't have enough material on the original characters and were trying to ad lib.  Still it's very much worthwhile watching this sometimes fictional account of a young Hemmingway and his first and lost love+dvd
Classic+P+Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day.  While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style-rapid-fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears.  It's also the kind of violent, genre-defying, and pop culture reference-laden movie, complete with way-cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade.  For my money at least, this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting, but annoyingly depressing and pedantic, Requiem for a Dream, which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise.  Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes.  It doesn't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction, but it doesn't downplay all the fun of it either, which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability.   Trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director Danny Boyle, whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the slightly-less-brilliant 28 Days Later.  Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all-time top ten movie lines ("Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"), my favorite nickname ever, fictional or otherwise ("We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit"-brilliant), and more "Oh my God, did I just see that?" images than you'll find in fifty Hollywood blockbusters.  In Boyle's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen, be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room, the movie's protagonist climbing into Scotland's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost, or the hallucinatory, nightmarish haze of a cold-turkey withdrawal.  The unrestrained depictions of sex, nudity, violence, drug use, and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish, but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid goings-on in one country's drug-laden urban culture.    The action is filtered through the point of view of the movie's narrator, Mark Renton, a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because, well, all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison.  Although I don't use drugs (well, the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway), it's not exactly hard to understand Renton's reasons-in a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him, the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives.  Really, that's what the movie's about-the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness.  Renton's not that bad a guy; he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some Iggy Pop, and if his lifestyle causes anyone else (i.e., his parents) to suffer, well, that's just an unfortunate byproduct.  Besides, it's not like he's missing that much: the Scotland of Trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy, Detroit-esque post-industrial decay, and even the natural beauty of the local highlands isn't enough to overcome the cynicism that's overtaken Renton and most of his friends.  Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it.  Although Ewan MacGregor plays Renton in career-making fashion (too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre Star Wars prequels), Robert Carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing Begbie, an unhinged, beer-swilling psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him, intentionally or not.  Even though (or perhaps because) he's so violent and unpredictable, Begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone.  Even though I wouldn't get within fifty feet of the guy, I couldn't help but enjoy watching him, especially with Carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance.    Besides, in addition to what I've written above, how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees?  If that doesn't scream fun for the whole family, I don't know what does+dvd
A History of Violence: The Best Film (2005)+P+David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence" is the type of film that you may not know how will wind up in the end, or what will happen next, but from the chilling starting sequence featuring what is the most violent image of the whole film, you know it's a film that's ready to raise your hairs, maybe for sheer pleasure or maybe because it's an exciting experience. The film probably shouln't be qualified as a thriller, even if it is a thriller and it is full of non cheap thrills and emotions, but as the modernization of westerns. It is, after all, a western. The character portrayed brilliantly by Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, and as the movie unravels we see that's he's no different to the Man with No Name or to Will Kane, for he is just the "good" cowboy, the man that we route for, the man that we want shoots the other men. As the movie advances, the plot doesn't thicken or gets more complex. As a matter of fact it's tough finding a plot so simple, yet so compelling and fun. The movie is quite fun, specially for those who like their movies to be charged with mordant black humor, and violence served in both spectacular showdowns and straight shots of blown away faces and blood splattered frames.   The acting is another thing. It is the best acted movie of the year, featuring a sexy and absolutely spectacular Maria Bello, a spooky Ed Harris, who under some makeup seems like a man you don't want to mess with, and William Hurt, in a part no longer than ten minutes, but ten minutes that opaque any other film on the silverscreen. Add to that Cronenberg's direction, which filles every scene with dinamite, and every shot with visual flair and delight.  As the final credits are rolling we get the sensation that this is a flawless film, and as our eyes rehearse it over and over again, we get to the conclusion that this is a flawless film. Some may say that it has no sense and that it is ridiculous, but if you think about it Munich and Syriana, and L'Enfant and Red Eye and Casablanca and almost every other movie made had the same purpose: Just to entertain. That is after all the final purpose of films, and this one succeeds high above the ground. It is also the best thriller, western, comedy and drama that has passed on the screens on a very long time.+dvd
Nothing to marvel over.+N+I wanted to see this film in theaters. I am a Cronen fan. I admit. I wasn't really a huge fan on Viggo Mortensen. I never read the book, but somehow I was drawn to this film, indirectly.  So, I wait for the DVD. Which isn't such a bad DVD as it is a film. Firstly, there are no surprises. Any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer, the DVD cover, or the DVD ad. Viggo's performance as a whole, wasn't too shabby. Ed Harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie. So in this small, secluded town Tom Stall aka 'Joey, turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero. Although, it turns out Tom Stall wasn't much of a hero as he was a villain. That's about it. The movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet.  The sex scenes felt out of place more than anything. I couldn't stress that enough. I'm going to be blunt. They are too random. They are in bad taste. They are uncomfortable. They are very much disliked by me, personally.  And finally, the ending. The ending was probably the most empty finish I've ever witnessed. Tom Stall goes after his brother, takes care of him, drives back, and Sits down for a nice meal with the family. Three words. Fade to black.  I give this movie 2 out of 5 stars. For two reasons. Some of the action scenes were interesting, and Ed Harris. I would not recommend this film+dvd
Not what I expected+N+I read the only review for this item and ordered it, expecting to see a fantastic display of sound and some of the interaction of these artists with Mr Hancock as they created music, each colaborating to have a unique blend of sounds. Actually this is only a documentary showing this interaction, and as such is very interesting. But if you are looking to see an hear the full length videos of these great colaborations you will be disappointed, that is not included in this dvd. Only small samples are there for you to see. This was a real disapointmet because the quality of video and audio are fantastic.    +dvd
The film deserves NO credit. Disney thinks that people are too stupid to read the great stories that they changed.+N+I am so mad at Disney and their movie "Hercules" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.   Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this+dvd
A disappointment...+N+I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.  This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.  The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.    I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not.+dvd
ENDURING CLASSIC+P+Even though this movie has some "miles" on it...It never seems to be "dated"..the story is still full of suspense...and even though we have seen it several times..it never grows old.  We live in a small fifth wheel..fulltime and this is one of the movies we both voted to take with us for those rainy days!  A "must-have" for anyone who loves movies+dvd
More proaganda than documentary+N+Bottom line... 1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa. 2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.   3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish "GORE from BUSH".  Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right. +dvd
Prevention Fitness Systems Express Workout - Belly Butt & Thighs+P+I love this workout CD.  It is simple & I get a really good workout from it.  I like that they have three 10 minute segments & you can do them all or one.  The butt segment is my favorite section+dvd
Stunning visuals, Dismal premise and narration.+N+Visuals are stunning, editing is superb - so if you need a visual guide to the Bible, this is pretty good. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends.  Bruce Feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books, but the trip has an inherent weakness - Mr. Feiler is a skeptic. He is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes. For example, ascending the Mt. Ararat, where the Bible says the Ark of Noah rested; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place. He wonders - melting ice-caps? In other words, Bruce Feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the Great Flood!   If Bruce Feiler believes that there was a garden of Eden as the Bible says (his very first stop), then he must also believe that God made the heavens and the earth, as the Bible says! If HE can create the Heavens and the Earth by the Word of HIS mouth, HE can also perform miracles. You cannot pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the Bible is true in its entirety, or it is not. If it is not true, then it does not need Bruce Feiler's help to prop up its so-called "stories".   This aspect of Bruce Feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing.  Why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your Guidebook? More examples? Bruce Feiler suggest that since the Sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the Bible says crossed over from Egypt, therefore the numbers must be wrong. How about the Manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in Sinai? I could go on....but you get the point. After a while, this becomes very annoying.  If you are a believer, this is not for you. I would not recommend it for my children.+dvd
WOW+N+Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an "accidental death" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms.+dvd
2 stars for cameos+N+A dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the US and abroad. I was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen, but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target, I think it's just a shame.   The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin, but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight. The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many.+dvd
Worst BE we own+N+My son, husband, and I really do not like this DVD because (unlike other Baby Einstein DVDs) this DVD is too focused on cheap looking computer animation. There are very few puppet scenes, and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth. The music is pretty bad, too. I prefer the music of Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven. This sounded synthetic and computer-generated, not "real." I found this DVD to be boring and couldn't keep my attention or that of my son. My son (15 months) can't watch this entire DVD. He gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions  (which take up most of the DVD and are pretty fast in pace).  I was underwhelmed and wish I hadn't purchased this DVD. It is not like previous BE DVDs.  I suggest Baby McDonald, Baby Da Vinci, or Baby Mozart to those who wish to purchase a BE DVD. +dvd
Never available - don't bother+N+I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point.  I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted.+dvd
Don't buy this 1-Disc release.+N+I bought the Japanese 2-Disc edition from Amazon's Japanese site.  The only thing that is in Japanese only are the kiddy games everthing else is in English with removable JPN subtitles.  The JPN edition is NTSC and region 2.  If you only have a region 1 DVD player try to find a copy of the old Tarzan Collectors 2-disc edition release+dvd
Disney needs to get it together!+N+For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.  Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement+dvd
Born To Lose+N+Does Deniro even appear in this movie?  Talk about false advertising. +dvd
One of the Top 10 Horror Movies Ever +P+Deffenitly one of the best movies ever made in horror. The plot was deep and it itroduced the world into the best horror icon there is. Unlike others (Freddy) Pinhead had not changed his attitude. Loads of gore and people getting ripped apart. They even have a few sex scenesthrown in their. Clive Barker really knew what he was doing when he mad this movie. Go out and get this no or you will be sorry you didn't cuz this is a classic.+dvd
The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter+N+The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though+dvd
A Huge Disappointment+N+Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.  This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.  Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one+dvd
I don't get it+N+I really wanted to like this film, but I just don't get it. I have to agree with reviewer Marc.  If you love the type of European cinema which is slow, dark, and sinister, then you'll like this. If you prefer something more lively, you won't.+dvd
&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; Is Missing?+N+Then why bother?  This is terrible for the true Prince fan, Warner needs to come out with a better DVD compilation...  Truly disappointing+dvd
I too agree with Kenny.+N+This is the most pointless show ever. Seeing baby's fart and dogs biting crotches and people degrading themselves by making themselves look like complete dumbasses is funny? Have the brains of America been THIS simplified? This is a show that belongs on MTV- it has all of the traits an MTV show has: it's pointless, it's pointless, umm... It's pointless... And, well, it's pointless! If you wan t a show with humor (not to steal anything from Danny), watch the Simpson- the funniest show ever along with Family Guy. Why would anyone want to watch a show about people acting like complete idiots? MTV Rocks, maybe.+dvd
Hell City Shinjuku and Monster+P+The movie deals with an evil man known as Rebi Ra, who has summoned demons to help him conquer the world and destroy Shinjuku, a part of Tokyo with and earthquake. Ten years later, the city is a demon-haunted wilderness when Rebai attacks the World President+dvd
Unadvisable+N+I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson.  It was only in the title of the name.  I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material.  It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction.  Silly me, I should have checked the rating.  I "assumed" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson.  I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime.  By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience.  Watch at your own eternal risk+dvd
Film: 4 stars, DVD: 1+N+I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!  Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD.  I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.  Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.

Perfect prelude to the Terminator series!!!!+P+I would recommend anyone getting into the Terminator series should see this movie first.  Colossus - The Forbin Project demonstrates how computers and machines take over the world and for humanities first struggle to become free.  Very good plot and detail+dvd
Relive Childhood Memories+P+WWE produces good quality documentary DVDs (I can't always say the same about their raunchy live shows).  This is another well-made, interesting, and entertaining WWE DVD.    It brought back lots of memories for me.  A lot of the 80s gimmicks seem corny and overly tame by today's standards, but they seemed pretty dumb to me at the time, too, and I was just a kid.    One sort of sad thing is to see Bobby Heenan's commentary.  He doesn't sound or look anything like he used to.  He appears gaunt and withdrawn and slurs his words.  He says with a touch of sadness in his voice that he misses the days of going out there and entertaining the fans (realizing, I'm sure, that he will never again be a personality on any wrestling programming)+dvd
Motzart's Video collection?+N+I hate to part company with the other reviewers here, as well as the Amazon comments but this NOT a must have.  I am huge fan of New Order and Joy Division and think they are one of the most important modern western popular bands of the last, almost thirty years for all their well-known contributions to existentilism and furturism in alternative, independent rock. Basically inventing post-punk, being one of the inventors of the dance-music, electronica scene a decade before most other bands and accidentaly inventing "goth" music along the way.  Not to mention being excellent musicians with a very artsy, deep and humorous sensitivity.  But, because they are such a good band it is glarringly obvious that the "rock video" is nothing more than a corporate music business era chore that bands just have to do as part of the job.  Film critic Rodger Ebert once said the rock video is "empty."  Here, they aren't so much empty as New Order's music is so good, just pointless.               I find myself almost angry that a beautiful song such as "Ceremony" would have such a terrible video like this(incidently, I do not know what the viewer below is talking about...there is no original version of the "Ceremony" video...just this thing). An aweful, unwatchable piece of useless garbage featuring a fellow walking around with a trashbag on his head. I guess that is a reference to the thought process of music video directors. Not sure what else it could be. I could only stomach 40 seconds of this filth. I'm afraid after listening to this tune for more than ten years, both Joy Division's and New Order's...the images in mine and in other musician's heads will have to do. Unwatchable. Trash. The new "Tempation" video....embarrasing.  Watch their concert videos, go see them live or better yet, think for yourself.  There are a few winners..."Confusion" is a classic and a great video as well as little bit of music history.  "Perfect Kiss" is cool but I've seen it enough and life is short. "Touched By the Hand of God" is very funny..but ..again..life is short. The only thing I hadn't seen before and actually kind of liked was the Gina Birch "Crystal"..that was a slightly cool workday music industry bit. Not important art in anyway....but better than Franz Fernidad peeing on an art gallery wall like the Nazis used to do.  Videos?  As for the documentary on the other disc. This is much better but is almost 13 years old. There are some excellent Joy Division clips here. Why don't we have a full DVD of all the Joy Division footage in the world yet? You get many of the same videos on the other disc played in full again on THIS disco too..in case you're someone like me who hated them enough the first time. Some great stuff, a bit of live Joy Division, great early live versions of 'Blue Monday", "Tempation"..and yes.."Ceremony". The interviews are great as New Order speaks like real musicians and their collaborators are an interesting bunch making up a lot of what urban nightlife music culture has been from the late seventies until today on both sides of the Atlantic.+dvd
Great Documentary+P+I want my children to remember what happened on that horrible day; this dvd will greatly help. The events of September 11th are well documented from beginning to end.  I especially liked the fact that CNN did not try to politicize anything-- they just told the story based on the facts.  Well worth the price+dvd
This loosely disguised "show" is nothing but a mouthpiece for the liberal agenda of broken marriages, pedophilia, & infidelity!!+N+This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline.  At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.  This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.  By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.  Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.  To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.  In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony.+dvd
bad drama clothed in shabby eroticism+N+movie about 2 women trying to con a pro at seduction. Mediocre dialogue with same acting and plot. The eroticism is wooden and tepid. Shabby treatment even for a French movie. Yuck+dvd
Val Kilmer at his best +P+It was great, pure and simple just great.   Good triller, good surprises and great acting.   The entire cast was wonderful. +dvd
Under-rated...+P+Intriguing movie with as many layers as an onion.  There is also a surprising, rare commentary by star Val Kilmer (one of the most under rated actors of the day) in which he alternately teases and admires with warmth, director David Mamet ("Dav-eed Mam-ay"), as well as the Black Ops/Rangers-types he plays in Spartan.   Best to go into the film unspoiled and be surprised, several times over.  For anyone who loves espionage with a twist, this one won't disappoint+dvd
The Rock and  Vaughn stole the show+N+Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.   +dvd
ha ha ha great movie!!! ha ha ha!!!+P+greatly funny!!!  a must get!!!  hillarious!!!  wow and a ha ha!!!  i recomend this movie to all who love rock and to all who love comedy...and those who love both to+dvd
Lucy and Ricky+P+Over 50 years ago a show previewed.The I Love Lucy show.A show that would make history.I give this season 5 stars and would give 100 if it went that high.If you want a show full of fun and laughs, and the way television used to be before the anything goes generation took over.just set back and get lost in the way we all wish life could be again+dvd
Chomsky Views on Current Events+P+This documentary shows bits and pieces of a big speaking engagement of Chomsky and two talks he is giving to activist groups. The only thing was, the documentary was kind of short - like 1 hour and 10 minutes. But it was good. Here are some highlights:  - When the Russians invaded Afghanistan, the U.S. press gave sharp criticism to the Russians. However, since the U.S. press has a U.S. audience why doesn't the press tell Americans what is happening with their tax dollars and what they can do to fix their mistakes. An example at this time was U.S. funding for death squads in El Salvador and Indonesian funding for the massacre of Timorese. It is cowardly for our criticisms of Russians, when we as Americans have no control over them, but we do have control over what we do and ourselves.  - The media was most free during the mid nineteenth century, this was before media started getting advertising in it. Once advertising started to happen, media could not say certain things the advertisers did not like.  - Run up budget deficits by giving massive tax cuts that benefit the wealthy, then cut social programs.  Then eventually get rid of Social Security and public education.  Getting rid of public education and Social Security just eliminates solidarity and sympathy with others.    - If your pension is tied up in stocks - stocks go up when people lose their jobs, that is against your own interests and all worker's interests.  This Chomsky documentary was more entertaining than the previous made ones. If a person does not pay attention to foreign policy, they can still grasp the concepts and ideas that are presented in this documentary. This documentary provides plenty of ammo to help people think and get active. Watch it and have house parties or let a bunch of politically passive friends watch it.+dvd
New Edition Garbage+N+Thank you to the people out there specifically rating the edition. The "new" features really do suck. Let the movie companies know you're sick of this re-issue, new edition garbage, and everyone out there keep on giving bad reviews to these crappy "new" editions. Let the weasely bean counters in accounting know that their greedy grab for a profit margin will ultimately turn consumers off from buying their products period. It's certainly given me pause when it comes to buying a new DVD.+dvd
Pathetic Gangster Style Movie+N+I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time.  I couldn't disagree more.  I found this film to be a disappointment.  Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together.  When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor.  In "Road To Perdition" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing.  The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development.  I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks+dvd
One of the most overrated films of all time.+N+The best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and Scorsese's knowledge of New York personalities. But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets.  From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy.  Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking.  I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing "it's funny" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny+dvd
Excellent, easy, energizing practices+P+I LOVE these practices! They go so well with the longer Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. The A.M practice is my particular favorite, it really gets me going, I do it almost everyday, in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon. If I'm particulary rushed, I might repeat the A.M. practice, I like it so much. The P.M is pretty good, too; I get to sleep quicker when I do it.+dvd
What the hell were they Thinking?+N+Well what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn't what I'd expected. Those who'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right. The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care.  Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story. The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch. The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear. For those of you planning to buy this DVD, stay away. It's a huge rip off. It's just something to keep you waiting for Shrek 3+dvd
not worth buying+N+Being a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, I bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work. Nope, this movie is garbage. First thing I noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots. The acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous. Over all, it's not a movie worth buying.+dvd
Not quite ready for "ER"+P+Here's a stylish and dark little gem of a sci-fi/supernatural outing, with Kiefer Sutherland, William Baldwin, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts as really cool medical students who experiment with life and death. Sutherland especially sets the tone with verve, and he walks around dark, deserted city streets decked out like someone from a Duran Duran music video--the consummate big-city, white-boy graduate student.+dvd
Terrible Movie+N+From start to finish a total waste of time.  I viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman, we were all appalled at how desparate this "Pamela" was note to the director not all women waiting on God are that desparate.  The so called Christian principals in this movie were laughable.  At the end of the movie I found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time+dvd
No Show+N+This item was never received. Amazon's tracking system claims that it was shipped on January 20 by Canada Post.+dvd
The film deserves NO credit. Disney thinks that people are too stupid to read the great stories that they changed.+N+I am so mad at Disney and their movie "Hercules" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.   Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this+dvd
A lot of trouble for nothing.+N+The characters in this book and production are its downfall.  The young lady owner sees someone take her diamond.  She has access to this person; it is someone she knows.  Why not just ask this person to give the diamond back?  Why not ask "Why did you take it?"  Why condemn this person without giving him or her a chance to speak?  This stupid girl (Rachel is her name) soured me on the whole book!  This is not the way that people would really act in this situation.  Collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much.  If Rachel had spoken up, she could have saved others, like Sargent Cuff a lot of trouble+dvd
KILLING CLOWNS AND FURRY ANIMALS+P+In its fourth season, CSI focuses more on the crimes and their participants, although the regular cast does have some momentous moments:  Grissom's surgery results; his involvement or lack of with Sarah, who starts manifesting her own personal crisis; and Catherine finds a new beau and a new paternal figure.  As always, the series is ripe with intriguing plots, forensic facts, and crisp writing, editing and performances.  Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda continue to grow in their roles while Petersen, Helgenberger and Guilfoyle continue to provide the foundation of excellence for this always enjoyable series.  On to Season 5+dvd

DO NOT BUY the 3D Version...less than 15 mins total 3D+N+I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.    We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...  Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.  Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release+dvd
Poof!!!+N+Well, my gosh, what a waste of time, U2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes (u2.com members, ticket prices.)  I won't go on and on about U2 being sold out, where it all went wrong, all I know is that U2 are getting by and panicked when Popmart was'nt well recieved, mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it.  So the DVD... boring whats wrong with it  1. Crap editing, as others have mentioned 2. The band look bored 3. Bono looks like fat Elvis 4. Bono can't sing anymore 5. Was it really neccesary to have a camera in Bonos sunglasses? 6. Extras??? Two thirty second clips of Zoo TV and Popmart both of which they have'nt released on DVD and both of which are impossible to buy as VHS is extinct now. (Despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums.) 7. The credits are listed as a extra feature. 8. Plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album "All that you can't leave behind".   ....has its moments, but at the end of the day its the performance that counts, not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable!! camera editing.  If you want to have a collection of U2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add "Rattle and Hum" "Actung Baby" "Zoo TV live from Sydney" and "Popmart" VHS's to your collection, thats if you can dig them up from anywhere.  U2 have yet to release a decent DVD, dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth+dvd
The worst Pixar movie ever+N+I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you+dvd
The best new comedy on TV with a moral message to boot+P+Just when I thought TV networks had forgotten what funny was, here comes Earl.  This is absolutely the funniest new comedy on TV.

THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY A GOOD MOVIE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION+dvd
Pretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort+N+Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.+dvd
sorry I got it+N+could have been a truly interesting film, just plain simpleminded and annoying+dvd
The Best Trilogy Ever!!!+P+X-Men, X-Men United and X-Men "The Last Stand" are simply spectacular! The cast,the characters, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever!!!.I have seen lots of movies in my life, but nothing compares and comes close to X-Men.    +dvd
dvd -Love Comes Softly+P+"Oh my goodness!!!" If you LOVE a feel good, emotional roll-a-coaster, family movie. This is it!! This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It has all the elements of every emotion you can come up with. The actors are superb and you feel like your part of the scene. I have watched it 3 times and will watch it again. Just make sure you have a box of kleenex handy+dvd
Unique (one of a kind) Film+P+Here's yet another film I saw as a young lad. But this isn't just any western comedy...It's got that special something that only comes around ever now and then. Terance Hill does a great job as Trinity. For instance in the opening scene Trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans, which he puts away quite quick...I read on his website that he starved himself for 24 hours in order to do that scene. This is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy. I would also recommend Trinity's third film "My Name Is Nobody" which stars Henry Fonda. Anyway...if you like good western fun then I would say buy this dvd and enjoy+dvd
Don't hesitate to buy RENT+P+I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!  +dvd
You've got to be kidding.+N+This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie. +dvd
So............... Boring................+N+Here are some interesting facts relating to "Heat" and myself:  LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231 NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0 NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0 NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6   Truth be told, I've never actually watched "Heat" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really "Heat"s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)  And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film "Adaptation", and though it didn't specifically refer to "Heat" it totally applies.  On a related note, "The 3" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than "Heat", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out "Adaptation".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)     Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think "Heat" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years "Heat" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.  But til then, the hell with "Heat".  I'll just watch "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "The Departed" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than "Heat".   +dvd
Amy Tan's Wonderful Work brought to life+P+This movie has stayed with me since I first saw it almost 8 years ago.  I'm very happy to have found it to add to my collection.  This movie explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter. And though the story focuses on Chinese mothers and their American daughters, the struggles are timeless and so is the love+dvd
DO NOT buy this movie~ worst ever!+N+This is seriously the worst movie ever.  The last time I saw it was in the theater, and I still can't get over how bad it was.  In fact, it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy.... We didn't speak for six months after we saw it together!  I too wish I could give it no stars.... And obviously people aren't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002!  I can't believe you can even buy it on DVD+dvd
Neat little collection+N+This is a pretty good collection for the Mickey beginner. I wouldn't purchase it however if you already have the Walt Disney Treasures "Mickey Mouse in Living Color" series because all the shorts are on those DVDs as well+dvd
A Real Treasure!+P+I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include:     Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song "A New Argentina" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.     Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in "The worst Pies in London" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street     Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational "Before the Parade Passes By" from Hello, Dolly!     Yul Brynner performing "Shall We Dance?" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!     John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-"Hey There" from The Pajama Game     Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in "Kids" from Bye Bye Birdie     Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song "Willkommen". This song never gets out of your head!     Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: "All That Jazz" and "Nowadays". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.     Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song "Lullaby of Broadway" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.     Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform "Tomorrow" and "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.     Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-"Jellicle Songs" and the classic "Memory". It is stunning to watch.     Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- "Buenos Aires" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.     Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song "Applause" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of "hits home" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.     All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!               +dvd
Walt Disney Would Never Have Put His Name on This.+N+"The Wild" is under the "Walt Disney Pictures" banner, and even rated G, so I expected it to be a picture for the whole family, of which the studio is proud. I hoped it would put me in the Disney mood prior to our family trip to Walt Disney World.  Disappointed am I. It's mediocre and has just about nothing in common with the Walt Disney legacy. To be sure, it is not unusually offensive (the way the usually superb Ron Howard offended me with his witless and crude destruction of "Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas"). It is just irritating and amateurish in its writing and direction. For those of you who know something about animation, has no one informed the director "Spaz" (his self-chosen moniker) or any of the animators the concept of the "hold"? A "hold" in animation is when the movement stops for a moment to emphasize an expression or an attitude or a gesture. It is priceless when used well (and gives the animator a few frames worth of a break, besides). Perhaps the all time masters of the hold in animation are Chuck Jones (think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner), Tex Avery, and Bob Clampett during the golden age of Warner Brothers cartoons.  "The Wild" has a total of zero holds. Everyone and everything is moving twenty-four times every second from movie's beginning to end. Who can watch that? My eyes just couldn't take it. The attitudes and gestures were all there. They were just there ten times more often than any human mind could process.  But that could be forgiven if the story was clever, conveyed a meaningful theme and was told with clarity, drama, and humor.  Instead of clarity, every sentence of dialogue was written to sound ironic or sarcastic or "funny" or "witty," never actually achieving real humor or wit. It's hard to know what any character really wants if they never express themselves clearly and simply. (I suppose once in a while they did, but that was the exception.) There is no attempt to make the squirrel's romantic crush remotely believable, and the father-son theme is trite as can be. Finally, there is so much slapstick violence (characters get hurt a lot) that I almost question the G rating. It's a valid rating but the film is definitely too full of scares (like the far superior "The Incredibles") for anyone under age 7. (This is not new in the Disney tradition, as "Snow White", "Bambi", "Sleeping Beauty" and maybe "Peter Pan" are also too intense for the very young).  There is no less artistry required to make a kid's comedy animation than any adult movie. In fact, more awareness of one's all-ages audience is required to make it entertaining and meaningful rather than irritating, boring or traumatizing. The theme of "The Wild", trite as it is, has potential value but it's ineffectively communicated.  I think "Spaz" and his crew believed they had a film so full of roll-on-the-floor belly-laughs it would excuse the flimsiness of the story. Unfortunately they were mistaken. This was not a Pixar movie if you didn't figure that out yet. The good news is, Pixar is back in business with Disney and we can look forward to their consistently superior material, which has already started with "Cars"+dvd
it had potential+N+With great music and a setting that reminds you of "Vampire Hunter D" it sucks you into watching the series.  The plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing.  The animation is good, which is a must have for me, but it wasn't enough to redeem the series+dvd
if i could i would give it 10+P+There are no words to describe this movie.  The book is amazing but is does use many "bad" words in it.  The movie uses some but nothing drastic!!  This movie is the best.  What can you expect from such an amazing cast.  The developement of the characters is very well presented and this movie VERY LIKELY will make you cry, male or female.  After this movie you just want to watch it again and again.  Some of the scenes could be cut shorter but they also "make" the movie.  After watching the movie, you should discuss it with the people who watched it with you, it's interesting to see other peoples thoughts on this movie+dvd
Good film good film+P+I was just really able to appreciate this film.  Sure there were some lines that I didn't like and and I was a little unclear about some plot aspects and I wished we could have seen what happens to the characters after the film ended.  But overall, I really loved the message of the film and the originality of it.  This is a film about love, sexuality, and relationships.  It was really beautiful.  Most of what I must praise highest is the acting.  Every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered.  Corazza's is a VERY believable and truthful actor.  His acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what Matt needed.  Taylor was brilliant.  She exudes power and assurance.  And she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly.  She was perfection.  Allison was surprising convincing and excellent.  I say surprising because for a man dressed in woman's clothing, this is the first movie where I actually LIKED the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype.  Shannon was real person for me.  Boyd was absolutely excellent.  She seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art.  They were so lucky to get her for this.  She's a world-class actress.    This film was just really enjoyable.  I really found the writer's (Fraser) commentary to be especially interesting.  This film was daring, original, and well-directed.  A little unbelievable at points, but enjoyable none the less. +dvd
Oh, the things this kid does...+P+Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "sick" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: "Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it." That's the moral of the story, really.  "Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day+dvd
Well done movie...+N+... But is is not the truth. Since the wall fell, we have learned that old joe was right. Hey, I bet in a few years Clooney will make a film about how honest and truthful Bill Clinton was+dvd
You can get lost in this Bio-Pic+P+You can immediately feel that you are a part of history and even when you know their (Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera) story you still get surprised amused and amazed. I have seen their actual work and this film brings it back. For people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction. I found it interesting how Frida (Selma Hayek) and Diego (Alfred Molina) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them.   Also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of "Water for chocolate".  Many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate.  The colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film. I have only seen one other Julie Taymor directed film "Oedipus Rex" (1992) which also had this quality. Julie seems to know how to bring out thoughts that we do not know we have our selves and we see many things in a new way.  I started to buy the soundtrack but do not see Lila Downs on any of the tracks. And her singing was the soul of the movie.  Now it is time to read the Hayden Herrera (book) "Frida - A Biography of Frida Kahlo" to see how much is in this screen adaptation by Clancy Sigal.+dvd
Greatest American Hero - Utter Brilliance+P+I live in the UK.  Hardly anyone I know has heard of this show - REASON: UK ITV only showed Season 1 and some of Season 2 on Saturday mornings approx. 11am in 1987 and 1988 - quite a while after USA run.  I am looking forward to buying the remaining seasons as well, very pleased indeed.  Now - if we can have SEAON 1 of TV's BATMAN and all of STREET HAWK on DVD - life will be better still+dvd
what do you mean you LOST THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+i can still remember sitting down in front of the t.v. and watching the pilot movie as a kid and loving the idea of a superhero who was as lost about his powers as i felt about my 12 year old body at the time. funny and action packed this was a great show and i am glad to see that it has made it's way onto dvd. william katt,connie selleca,and the great robert culp star as the "team" of teacher ralph hinkley,bill maxwell,and pam davidson and they were a great team!     one night ralph is driving and spots a light in the sky,as does bill(culp as the funny non bending f.b.i. man) the light is a spaceship and ralph is given a "supersuit" with a book to tell how to use the suit(which he loses at once) and as he and ramrod stright maxwell join forces to save the world,ralph must also find out how to work the "suit"!     this is one of the best and most fun shows to come out of the early 80's and it was also one of the most over looked ones today. get this great action/comedy show and enjoy the tounge and cheek humor that is still fresh today.    "look at what's happened to me, i can't believe it myself,who could it be,believe it or not it's just me" part of the theme song(a top 10 hit and one of the best theme songs ever for a show+dvd
Very Poor Presentation+N+This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me.  The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene.  The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film+dvd
A Rewarding Investment (of time), but NOT A COP SHOW+P+The Wire is easily one of the greatest, if not the greatest, cinematic pieces of art ever.  Potential WATCHERS know this however, this is a show that requires a significant amount of commitment; do not expect to sit back and be entertained.  The show challenges the watcher and requires reflection on an array of intellectual levels.  At a minimum, the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots The Wire's creators masterfully placed for viewers.  The dull on the other hand will only see a show with cops and a group of unintelligible thugs while searching for the quick entertainment fix that can only come from brainless shows like Cops, CSI, or The Shield.    +dvd
What people refused to see then and now+P+I saw this movie also and loved it.    Questions:  Why do people feel the need to tell the entire story when giving reviews?  Just say what you liked about the movie give your critiques ONLY   Some of you folks told the whole d....movie.  Also to Acorn "jcorn59483"  Blalock is described as "Genius and Unbridled Ambition and    Taylor is described as "loyal and dedication"   ???   Did you see the same movie as the rest of us.  Or are you unaware of your own unconscious prejudices??   Also to another reviewer Did not Taylor have a Major contribution to the valve that saved the life of blue babies ???  Maybe I should see the movie again.  You gave the credit to Blalock and some other Caucasian Doctor  Only  ??    Racism and Prejudices are such complexities of the "American Life"  Some of us live it every day and say "What!... Not Me!  While others live and deal with it every day!  How obsurd to call the genius of Vivien Taylor "loyal and dedicated"  This man had No formal medical training yet he went toe to toe with a Doctor who was at the top of his field.  Who was the real genius here  !  +dvd
Painfully Bad+N+A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs. You know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you haven't even cracked a smile.  Good gawd, Dustin Hoffman sitting on the toilet?  Robert DeNiro breastfeading a baby? Foreskin dropped into a fondue pot?  Wow, a movie that hurt to watch.  It wasn't even worth renting for free from the public library.     +dvd
Great Italian Mob Movie+P+I just happend to rent this movie from blockbuster one night after reading the info on it. I was blown away! What a great movie the actors are highly underated and are now some of my favorites. Another thing that was cool was that the actor William Dameo played the voice of Paulie in the new video game Mafia and many of the same character names are used in this film that were from the video game. Tell ya what...Look out for the actors in this movie, all of them should be leading actors in the years to come. Get this movie, it will be one of your favorites+dvd
Needs even more Creativity+N+I had high hopes for Requiem of Darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it. Also, the characters looked very unique and intriguing. Unfortunatley, the beginning is very rough, both in content and speed of the show.   The plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories. He is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head. He meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers, and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy.  Unfortunately, the show is not as slick as the plot sounds. The first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling. It is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous. Throughout the episode, you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises. The problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who's who.   The second episode I found more enjoyable since it was unique. It is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman. The willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children. It even has a little plot twist, nothing extrodinary but still welcoming.  And once again, the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders. This is when the show became boring for me. I do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about, but I like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about. Also, the show's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the DVD.  I give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great. Unfortunately, the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show weren't the main focus of these first few episodes. Maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot, but I personally don't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk.  One last note: this show has very intense adult content. Don't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not. Actually, I personally thought the rating was too low for this show+dvd
Brilliant, season after season+P+Unfortunatly southpark above seison 4 is not availlable in Holland on DVD. So everytime a new season is released I rush to have it shipped from abroad. This season was really worth the waiting, again.  As always the makers of Southpark succeed to brilliantly mock society, recent events and stereotype the American way of life.  "Beef" between a south park dancing crew and the boys, the man-child Michael Jackson with a child on his own moves into Soutpark, people coming in from the future to work who somehow make you wonder what that reminds you of, the unevitable and hypnotising attraction of Wall-mart, the quest for ratings of rivalling TV shows , Paris Hilton with her own Stupid Spoiled whore product and al always many, many of Cartmans brilliant, ignorant, blunt, shameless, rude, spoiled , respectless behaviour.   To put it short : hilarious. But be careful! Don't watch this if a naked Cartman might upset you+dvd
Get This DVD!+P+I am a second grade teacher and always looking for creative ways to supplement my lesson plans on the planets. Children don't easily identify with planets, since they are spheres that cannot be seen in their daily lives. Children usually respond to the colors, but never really connect with them. Now, with "My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets" the planets all have faces, personalities, and the undivided attention of my class. The show transforms the planets into memorable characters. It really has helped my students to remember not only the names of the planets, but also detailed facts about them. I have recommended this DVD to our school district, for I feel that it should be part of the regular curriculum. The DVD is so wonderful that it can be enjoyed outside the classroom as well and give children a real head-start on learning the planets and developing a passion for astronomy.    +dvd
Does Amazon evan watch their movies+N+what the hell is this!!!   Don't see this movie at all.I don't know what these people are on    ,but don't believe their lies.the story goes when this kid and his mental girlfriend are in a motercycle accident and the kid's girlfriend dies so he brings her back with 2-4-5 trixon.get this know the zombies eat flesh(you heard me,"flesh"not brains but "flesh").if you own this movie take it out to the back yard and eighther shoot it with a BB gun or burn it+dvd
Great Workout+P+This workout will get you reslts.  I did it for about a month and was completely toned. I wasnt that out of shape to begin with but it certainly worked its magic quickly.  I would say its a bit difficult to get through... what I like is that even after youve done it for a month its still somewhat of a challenge to finish.  The areas worked are exactly where women need it, you wont be disapointed.  I dont mind her personally either.  Its a bit much but when your doing a difficult workout it can be a welcome boost+dvd
Absolutely hilarious!!!+P+I just saw this on Comedy Central today and laughed so hard I cried!! And I was sick with a cold and flu, too, but it was so good that, after it was over, my husband and I went out shopping to try and find a copy to buy so that we could see it without the editing and commercials. Found a copy to rent, but it's so good I want my own copy to keep! Couldn't find it anywhere to buy today, so I'm ordering it from Amazon now and thought I'd put in my two cents about how great it is. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams are too priceless as the 15-year-old best friends who stumble unwittingly into the Watergate mess in 1972. They are befriended by Tricky Dick, who gives them jobs as Offical White House Dog Walkers of his famous dog "Checkers" in an attempt to please them so they won't talk about what they've seen (they don't know what they witnessed anyway, which is what makes it so funny). The entire cast is first rate and I haven't laughed this hard at a new comedy (new for ME, I mean) since I first saw "Me, Myself & Irene". This movie isn't nearly as crude in humor as the latter, but as far as the writing and the comedic talents of the fantastic cast, it ranks right up there with any of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure to put you in a great mood!  :)  :) The simplistic premise of the movie could have made it go either way (either really great or really awful), but these actors made it fantastic to watch and must have certainly had a blast filming it. I don't know if the DVD has outtakes but I hope so; I bet they would be hilarious to see. I was holding my breath the last few seconds as I waited for the ending, hoping it was going to be worthy of the rest of the film, and was NOT dissapointed. Laughed my b**t off at the ending!! Give it a watch; if you love to laugh, and especially if you were a dreamy teenage girl in the 70's who covered her bedroom walls with posters of Bobby Sherman and David Cassidy (like I did!), you'll LOVE this movie. It's not just for 40-something gals, either; my 50-year-old husband laughed himself silly too!!+dvd
Hilarious Sleeper Comedy+P+It isn't much of a surprise that "Dick" did not garner much of an audience when it was released in 1999 on the 25th anniversary of Nixon's resignation.  A few years earlier Oliver Stone's unintentionally comic "Nixon" laid a box office egg as well.  This hilarious film deserves to be seen because it is just a laugh-out-loud riot.  The plot involves two oblivious teenage girls (Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams) who form a friendship with Nixon and are employed as his dogwalkers.  All goes swimmingly until they unearth tapes in the Oval Office that reveal that Nixon is mean to his dog.  The gloves come off at this point.  No man who can be mean to his dog deserves to hold the highest office in the land.  Dunst and Williams are bubblingly hilarious as the girls.  Dan Hedaya does a dead-on hilarious rendering of Nixon.  Alot of amusing cameos including Will Ferrell, Harry Shearer, and Dave Foley.  Great period soundtrack, too.  I saw this film originally at a repertory house on a double-bill with "All the President's Men".  Guess which film left a more lasting impression+dvd
Awful...+N+As a made for TV movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a Saturday afternoon that you watch because you don't feel like changing the channel, it was okay. As the sequel to GWTW or the screen adaptation of the book I enjoyed reading so much, it was appallingly AWFUL. The acting was weak, and the woman that played Scarlett was mildly attractive at best. It was a complete waist of time and money+dvd
Love it+P+First i have seen this movie a few times, also have it vhs.  I love all types of movies.  plus the shipper was faster than  the expected delivery date.  Again, I always have loved this movie, and i am glad i have the dvd...  Now if only the remaining titles on my list were to come out.. like The Spanish Main (Paul Henreid 1945), Against all Flags(errol flynn, 1952) and at swords point(Cornel Wilde,1952)and black sheild of Falsworth( tony curtis) My collection would be complete.  Thank you amazon!!+dvd
Best Show Ever+P+Hilarious.  Simply hilarious.  This show is genius, one of the smartest and funniest comedies ever.  I am shocked it was cancelled after 3 seasons and amazed that it is not more widely accepted as quite possibly the best show on television.  Anyone with a good sense of humor that loves ridiculous situations and randomness would love these DVD's.  I only hope that comedy central releases seasons 2 and 3.  There is a petition, everyone who's interested should sign, just google it+dvd
Really, truly, awful+N+In the film commentary, Director Robert Altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying, 'I don't know what it was about but I really liked it.' (That's a paraphrase). And I think that's the key to why this film is so bad: The director didn't know what it was about.    The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time.   Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it! The writer/director was confused!  A waste of talent, and a waste of my time watching it. It is one of those films I watched thinking it HAD to get better. It didn't.+dvd
Heartwarming, good for all ages+P+I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry+dvd
Great romantic comedy+P+She's All That is a very funny movie.  It stars Freddie prince Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook.  They are comic geniuses.  The story is about a guy who made a bet with his friends about making any girl that they want into homecoming queen. They give Rachel a hot makeover.  The plan was going smoothly until he found out that he is falling in love with her himself!  Find out how he makes her into the queen and have a relationship at the same time.  Overall- a great movie+dvd
Good clean fun for today's kids, too.+P+I purchased this set for my 10 year old son to watch before his first trip to camp.  He couldn't get enough of the stories!  He watched another episode at every oportunity.  I had intended to cut off the TV time one evening just before the "Snipe Hunt" episode, but he and his younger sister begged to watch just one more episode so they could find out what a "Snipe" was.  As a parent I found it refreshing to see my children enjoying these programs.  There isn't as much "political correctness" toying with the plots.  The boys at the camp are allowed to be boys, and must face consequences for their actions.  There is teasing and trick-playing, but no one is oversensitive to the jibes.  One boy (Marty) is guided through his fear of horses with both a firm and gentle hand.  I highly recommend this series for all parents, especially those with boys in the 7-12 year old range.  But, I must say, my 7 year old daughter loved it, too! +dvd
I love the SHOW, the DVD's are another story!+N+Hello I won't sell you on the show-it's one of my favorites, and you can read other's opinions there.  What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player.  So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable.  It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all.  We don't have this problem with ANY other movies.  SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK.  All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP.  What a shame.  GOOD LUCK+dvd
Remington Steele Series+P+This is the second "Remington Steele" that I have purchased, and I love it!  It is wonderful to kick back and watch such a stylish show, with its stellar cast.  All of them -- Pierce Brosnan, Stephanie Zimbalist and Doris Roberts entertain me from the time I switch on my television until I turn it off+dvd
Have You Earned Your Black Card Yet? +P+I got this movie for my husband, cause of all the movies he's never seen it. I told him he could only get his black card unless he has seen this movie. And he laughed from beginning to end of the movie.   I personally loved the movie, i have plenty of favorite lines that keep me laughin even when i say them.+dvd
If you think you've seen it before...+N+...you have. This film has been compared to "Logan's Run", "The Matrix", and "Coma", to name a few, but it most strongly resembles 1979 B movie "Parts: The Clonus Horror", probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Sitting through "The Island", I kept thinking to myself "Boy, this looks familiar." In fact, "The Island" is almost a complete, play-by-play clone (ba da ching!) of "Parts", right down to the outfits worn by the clones. There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of "Parts", which should be an open-and-shut case.  This film is set in a futuristic clone colonie, where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts. The clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility's employees, not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise (the Island). Of course, the clones allegedly going to the Island are actually being euthanized for their organs, their patrons having gotten sick. The movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise. Ewan McGregor is satisfactory in this role, his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge. His female counterpart, Scarlet Johansen, is pure eye candy, a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead (or even a major part) in a college play (the best performance is turned in by Sean Bean, the Evil Scientistï¿½.)There is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on, making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie, but it is not only nothing special, it is nothing original. Maybe worth a rental, but not much more+dvd
What a soundtrack. Too bad the movie couldn't keep up.+N+This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame+dvd
Awful Acting+N+I found this DVD real cheap and bought it. I really tried hard to like the movie, but I just couldn't because the acting was incredibly bad, especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city. Even the guys who don't have lines display bad performances.   An hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie. I broke this DVD and threw it out, something I've only done to 4-5 DVDs I felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth+dvd
A Classic+P+It's a beautiful classic made during our time.  If you love romance, this is a beatiful remake of a classic. Love the children's and Annette's rendition of the Beatles "I Will".  Dissapointed that the song is not on the original soundtrack. I bought the VHS version in 96 and lent it to my friends.  They all loved it.  They kept wanting to borrow and replay it - for the song; as well as for the beautiful everything that best describes the the movie.  The VHS is now kaput and I definitely have this in my list of the next one to add to my collection of DVDs. Hope you will enjoy it too+dvd
A Tale Told By A Teenager, Signifying...?+N+The premise - that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller.  I don't condemn the film's corollary either: that each change produces new, unforseeable tragedies.  It's the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot, its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities.      It is therefore fitting that the director's preferred ending is included here.  It is the perfect catharsis for teens who "...wish I was never born!+dvd
lots of visual style.......little substance+N+me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't+dvd
the producers were drunk when they made this movie+N+Most off the scientific facts are wrong. The earth's center is as big as Mars!!!!!! Come on!!!!!! Maybe as big as Moon. Under the Earth's ground is liquid magma. Its liquid because off the pressure, and its not possible to under it. The Producers obviously forget about food supplies, and oxygen. The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing+dvd
Not the same old WATP workout+P+I just did this workout for the first time and I have to say it was a refreshing change from the usual kicks, knee lifts, side steps and marching of the other WATP series.  It was interesting and fun.    If you are familiar with any of Leslies tapes, you know that there is constant chatter and it will sometimes get weird, and the queing will be off, but that is Leslie.  The moves aren't complicated, so you may miss a second or two, but can catch up easily. In spite of all that, I find her a motivating instructor and I guess that she is laughing all the way to the bank since she sells jillions of dvds/videos despite not being perfect.     +dvd
"flowers & trees" had a stronger plot line+N+silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from "little mermaid" thru "aladdin" and "lion King" and "beauty & the beast", crud like this only reminded one of the era od "the black cauldron".+dvd
The details are wrong, the big picture is inexistant+N+The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.    All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.    The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment. +dvd
gobbledygook & self-righteousness & pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie+N+there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek+dvd
unique+P+i found the movie to be very creative and unique. i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set-up for a play would be. i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words/message. there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed: greed; true love; spirituality; determination; self-esteem issues; and jealousy. i am not a prince fan, but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day, and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman, who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them (clever). i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic, morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won+dvd
80s Movies Collector+P+Graffiti Bridge is a great Movie,One of prince greatest movies,IF You like PURPLE RAIN! Give Graffiti Bridge  a try,you wont regret it,I have it on dvd :)+dvd
Chilling little satire+N+Although the script was written in the mid-1980s, "Bob Roberts" doesn't feel dated. Instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of American politics. The title character, Bob, is a conservative folk singer who runs for the U.S. Senate, but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe. What struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens. While I thought that the message of the movie was right on target, I didn't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film. It kept me at a distance from the characters and, as a result, I didn't care as much about them as I might have done+dvd
A Slow Spin in the Porcelain+P+I'll make this short and sweet.  I used to work in spin.  I did advance, which is creating media events for politicians.  In other words, for a time I was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information.  I'll let others speak to the eerie connections to Orwell's foresight.  I'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case.  That which is represented in this piece is true.  The observations are astute.  The prognosis is grim.  I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Watch it again.  Share it with friends. +dvd
Waste of time...+N+As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, I really wanted to like this film.  I enjoyed them in Kiss The Girls, and I expected another interesting film.  Their performances were the only bright spot, but they couldn't rescue this movie.  This film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream.  There was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible.  As many other reviewers noted (I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces), it was so very predictable.    I rented 2 films yesterday, and I had trouble watching both of them, for very different reasons.  The other film was "Monster", starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.  I almost couldn't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and I forgot that it was a movie.  It absolutely is a gripping story, and Ms. Theron richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she received for it.  Conversely, I almost couldn't watch High Crimes because it was so ridiculous.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one. +dvd
Meet John Doe+N+I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now+dvd
A Celebration of Hopelessness+N+I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic".+dvd
Well Acted But Hardly A Classic+N+I found the other reviews very interesting.  Yes, the movie is very well acted, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars but frankly the abuse was so horrific I found the movie barely watchable.    I admit that when watching a movie I look for something to entertain & escape into.  If I want reality, I'll watch CNN.  For that reason, while I know child abuse exists & think it needs to be acknowledged to end it, I don't really want to watch someone hurt children (& animals).  Maybe part of the reason I had such a problem with this movie was the fact that everyone talks about what a great children's movie this is.  It's only appropriate if your idea of a children's movie is "Friday the 13th".  The violence is WAY too intense to let children watch+dvd
Silent Running+P+This is a little cheesey but, the movie is a classic.  It's a rather touching movie if you focus on the plot+dvd
Pretty stupid and obnoxious+N+Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.   +dvd
Top Ten Food Movie+P+I spent two weeks cruising the Italian neighborhoods of San Francisco looking for a restaurant like the one portrayed so richly in this movie. And I found one! Unfortunately, as might have been predicted from the film, it lasted only a few months before folding.  There's more to Big Night than the food. It's outrageously funny, for one thing, a quality many reviewers seemed not to appreciate. The acting is brilliant; for once, everyone acts in ensemble. It's original, not quite any Hollywood genre. It's poignant, in emotional terms most people can find believable. Is it a GREAT movie? Dumb question! It's a movie you'll enjoy and remember+dvd
A timeless masterpiece on universal themes+P+Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be?  Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning "To live"). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to "live it up" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor.  Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, "The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same." Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy.  The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its "inner life." Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado.   Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is "The Mummy." Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed.  It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces.  Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or "Mr. K," as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar.  The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews.  Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them.  There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to.  It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa.  Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered "too Western" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this "Mr. K" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you "hate" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term "timeless classic.+dvd
Best of Judd Nelson+P+Judd Nelson has made some good movies and some not so good. I count this as one of his best. As an attorney "Stormy Weathers" he can't be beat. He will stretch the limits of courtroon etiquette well past the limit if it will win his case. This is by far one of the best melodramas I have seen. Not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time.   The beginning is very light stuff, but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity. John Hurt turns in a magnificent performance as Judd's client in a murder case. Judd can't decide if his client is innocent or guilty, but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system.  Fans of courtroom movies should enjoy this even if they are not fans of the 80s bratpack. Great directing and excellent cast make this a winner. A nice soundtrack and scenes in Boston don't hurt either. Good quality DVD but no extras+dvd
Profound and sad+P+I thought the movie was exceptional. It speaks of human tragedy- the tragedy that occurs on a daily basis- the sadness of everyday life and the small victories that we experience- however small. It speaks of regret- yet as is spoken, you can't change what has already happened----nor,can you take it back. I thought it was honest and the performance that Ryan Gosling gives is true and sad.  I give this movie 5 stars because of the profoundness and the sadness of this movie.  All of the characters are flawed and expertly portrayed and most definately worth the time.....Enjoy+dvd
BORING WITH BAD CINEMATOGRAPHY+N+I just read _The DaVinci Code_ in less than 2 days.  I couldn't put it down.  It was fascinating.  Then, I put this DVD on and everyone in my family fell asleep!  I tried to keep them interested and have the DVD help explain some of the underlying theories that I found so interesting in Dan Brown's book, but the "expert" interviews were sloppy and not engaging.  When I switched to the extras, hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book, the glimpses of Westminster Abbey and The Louvre were very brief while the Rosslyn Church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work.  I wish they would have held still a little bit and let us LOOK at the place!    I have seen many good documentaries in my life, but this is definitely not one of them+dvd
Pedigree vs. Filigree.  Filigree wins.+N+Period dramas are, by definition, delicate commodities: they're balanced on that, ahem, "razor's edge" between high brow and just plain fussiness.  I think "Howard's End" is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and English lace.  Milliners, set designers and Helena Bonham Carter's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one+dvd
i thought anthony minghella was incapable of making a worse movie than "the english patient" ...+N+oops, mine bad!+dvd
Basically a 90 minute PETA commerical.+N+First off, I grew up with dogs, I have an affection for dogs.  I even have respect for PETA and their effort to ethically treat animals.  That's a good mission to have.  But, that is a message that does not play well as this 90 minute movie.  I mean with quotes like this "Maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature."  just went too far for me.  This movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay.  The musical score was fine enough as was the melody.  If you want a better dog movie, go get something like Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows.  Both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion.  This movie is literally for the dogs+dvd
Felt guilty for laughing+P+I felt a bit guilty about watching this foul-mouthed movie, but I have to admit that I laughed myself silly.  But don't make the mistake of letting your kids watch this one. Despite the "Santa" name, it's definitely not for children. I use the "Would I want to watch this movie with my mother" test, and the answer is a huge NO+dvd
Great DVD!+P+DVD received ahead of schedule.  New DVD in original package, great picture quality; better that original verson. +dvd
Stonewall Jackson's Way+P+Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential "Stonewall" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of "Stonewall" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with "Stonewall" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.    In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.   I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.   It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall. +dvd
The InCrowd is out.....+N+Susan Ward,coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on TV, gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from AOL Films.    Director Mary Lambert tries and fails to give us a Basic Instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures, it looks like Warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with.  As the lack of film sets show.   If you like Susan Ward, then give this a movie a try, if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future, DON"T FIND IT HERE+dvd
Never achieving its goal+N+I'll be right up front and admit that I do not own this DVD. I hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact. But then I realized that if you're reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.  Frankly, the movie barely approaches a "B-Movie" status. It's only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.  The plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.  One glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn't advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.  To its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.  It was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.  If you're a collector of good film, this really wouldn't be part of your collection. To add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships, it would be very appropriate. Sadly, it really is good for only that one reason, as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years+dvd
"R"-Rated movie, NOT PG-13!!! Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+N+I've read the other reviews and I don't know what version they got but the DVD I received has more than a brief scene of David with his wife (breasts CLEARLY exposed)in bed. That scene alone would not be allowed in a PG-13 movie. There is another scene where David is viewing Bathsheba bathing. She is standing, completely nude and you can see everything. Then the camera pans in close for a "waist up" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body.  This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut+dvd
Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Movie+N+I apologize the the children's author for mis-using the title of a very good book, but it seemed so right!  Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal.  There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life.  Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much.  I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie.  They are the redeeming features of the whole thing.  But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue.  Read a good book about it!!  Sorry, Oliver, but it's JFK all over again.  Plausible, but just not the case+dvd
I thought I knew a lot about the movie...+P+...but the materials Criterion put together for this great two disc set shed new insight and light to one of the greatest chambara films ever made. Thank you, Criterion, for taking my email (and who knows how many others) seriously and for bringing this pristine and wonderful DVD transfer of a true classic. This movie should be in every serious cinephile's collection, and I highly recommend this two disc set+dvd
My dog Loved it!+P+I am not kidding! My dog just sat right in front of the tv and watched this movie from beginning to end! He really loved this movie a lot and likes to watch it when ever we do. Anyway I really like this movie! The actors are great! I liked this movie more cuz the star is from jurassic park back in 1993. And I liked the intire cat and dog spy stuff. This movie was great and I think you and maybe your dog will like it too+dvd
Stealth Fighter+N+Oh my God, I can't believe they actually released this movie onto video! ...I had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film....thank GOD it was on HBO (I actually thought it was an HBO  made-for-tv movie)...anyways, this movie was SOOO bad, I'm surprised that  the Air Force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this  movie..seriously..there's no plot and horrendous acting, but what can you  expect from a movie with the title &quot;Stealth Fighter&quot;?  Besides  that, the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny....like the  ending, I won't ruin it or anything (wouldn't that be bad! )......just  don't bend over to pick up your beer (probably #12 by that point in the  movie) because you might miss the whole ending...it's over that quick!    One example of why this movie stinks so bad: Ice-T WALKS onto an Airforce  base...decides to meander over to a hanger, knocks down a couple of  &lt;good&gt; guys that look like offensive-tackle-types...then just jumps  into a Stealth fighter (that happens to have the keys in it, and is fully  gassed up)...and flies away non-chalantly....and he doesn't even rap!   Anyways, might be good if you're inebriated and need a good  laugh....otherwise, avoid this like a port-a-potty at a Buffet  concert...like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy  from the Simpsons, &quot;Worst.....movie......ever! &quot+dvd
Lets see......Nope!+N+(2 & 1/2 to be exact) I have no ideal, why I've choosen to write a review on this particular movie. I'm not really a fan of comedies & after watching this I can see why. However, All in All, the film has been well made, and luckily doesn't divulge into valugarity & offensiveness like a lot of recent comedies of this sort have -well maybe a little but not a lot. The actors are all likeable - unfortuntely I can't say that with some of the characters they portray. Catherine Keener is one of my favorite actresses but she doesn't use her trademark sardonic wit and sarcastic humor like in a lot of her other movies (i.e. Being John Malkovich, Your Friends and Neighbors) but she still manages to come away from this subversive comedy with a well likable character. OK, not to spend to much talking about this film: With all there is likable about this movie, for some reason, it just didn't gel with me. Oh and by the way: I too know a few people like the character Steve Carell portrays in this film and you know what: THEY'RE ALL HIGHLY INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALS. Sure they lack social skills and the right relationship, but why - in this country especially - is that so F&cking frown upon. IF I HAD THE CHOICE OF BEING A Sexaholic Hearthrob & a vastly intelligent person, I would choose the latter. SEEYA+dvd
Please enter a title for your review+N+One of the most overrated comedy shows ever. Basically the calibre of a high school talent show. In a way it reminds me of Tom Goes To The Mayor, seemingly fitting into a comedy niche I don't understand which is more about being weird than being clever, but it seems like it's even more about being dull than being weird. I've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head. I think these guys took that a bit too much to heart. Maybe the fans see some subtle naunces I'm missing, but to me it seems like I could have written most of this material with little effort.+dvd
Excellent documentary+P+This was an excellent documentary.  I had never heard of this film, until I viewed it during a class. A must see..+dvd
2025+N+I don't think I'm going to be around in 2025 to give an accurate evaluation .I'f I'm still here I hope I still remember who neil young is, and I'm still rocking in the free world +dvd
Not brave enough+N+An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators:  I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of "Treasure Island."  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version.  It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of "Treasure Island" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them.  What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe.  Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is.  Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of "a seafaring man with one leg."  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there.  The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke.  The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a "thundering apoplexy" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from "death at the hands of the pirates."  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to "be like the little children in order to be saved."  To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave.  To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.+dvd
A "Cross" to bare+P+This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Everything about this film says "beauty". From the beautiful storyline to beautiful scenery this film tugs at your heartstrings. Mary Steenburgen is perfect (and yes beautiful!) as Marjorie Rawlings who seeks to discover her true calling in the Florida backwoods. The music is....well beautiful. I wish a soundtrack was available for this film, as I would buy it in a second. By the way, this film received a 5 minute standing ovation at Sundance. Why? Because it delivers the goods. If you are looking for a film to "fill your heart", you found it. Watch and enjoy. I hope I run into Mary Steenburgen one day (quite possible here in L.A.) as I want to tell her how great and beautiful she was in this film (it's important that she know!!!)   +dvd
Fairy tale movie +N+Both versions are pretty much the same quality, only one is B&W and the other in color. I can't think of a more childish or ridiculous story as this one. It's embarrassing even to tell it here. On a humoristic level I could stand it (like the Marx Brothers films), but this story is told seriously. The characters read their parts of the script, they don't interpret it, because it's impossible to be natural with such lines. Maybe some kid would like this film today; I doubt it+dvd
It is not special+N+This product is routine Yoga and is not something unique. It is exactly which you can find in other Yoga classes+dvd
beware noting to do with Jet li or once upon a time in China+N+Cant even belive it's not good. Amator night at the movies+dvd
This was one of the one's that inspired me to start breakdancing! +P+You can read about this movie on all the other reviews. I have nothing to add! I want to promote the 2 videos that helped me really start to dance like this though! How To Do The Robot and Step-by-Step, both available on Amazon. Check em out so you can dance like they do in this movie!+dvd
bleh+N+The movie itself is a snoozer.  There's a good amount of physical comedy, but the story just went nowhere.  However, the running commentary is hilarious!  When the commentary is funnier than the movie, you know the movie is pretty bad+dvd
Ah Getting there+P+It's good but it could be better. However, all the the new story lines aren't needed, it just shows how bad of a writer you really are when you must change story lines to give your writing team or person an edge. I still gave them 5 star+dvd
This Is My Favorite Of The Muppet Movies!+P+I like the Muppet movies and my favorite is the Muppets Take Manhattan which I found to be cute and funny. I originally had this movie on video, the pan and scan video tape and I also had the video tapes for the other Muppet movies but I gave them to my little cousins and then I bought the widescreen DVD for the the Muppets Take Manhattan and I coouldn't be happier with the DVD and now I just have to buy the DVD,s for The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper and the new DVD's for Muppet Treasure Island and The Muppets Christmas Carol. BTW: I didn't buy my Muppets Take Manhattan DVD from Amazon. I bought it in Walmart for 5 dollars+dvd
Read the book - it takes less time!+N+The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film+dvd
2 Whole Stars...I Must Be In A Generous Mood+N+Like the title says, I'm being mad generous by giving this movie two stars...it really deserves none. Subspecies is an excellent, 4-part series written and directed by Full Moon Studio's Ted Nicholau (Actually, the first three Subspecies are allright, but the fourth movie sucks in my opinion). However, Vampire Journals is nothing more than a feeble attempt to portray a different side of the Subspecies archetype.   The characters, scenes, and acting in Subspecies Part 1-3 were superb. Yet this movie has an insipid plot and the actors are novice at best. The vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors, and I was bored for the last 1/3 of the film.   Essentially, the plot...if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named Zachary, who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is. So Zachary (Whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire Zachary anyway?) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by Ashe, a fledgling of the main antagonist (Radu)of all the Subspecies films.  In addition to this, Zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named Sophia, who has been kidnapped by Ashe. Because she is a gifted musician...or something, Sophia is being forced by Ashe, a  fervid music lover, into becoming a vampire as well. Really there's not much else to go into, except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film. So unless you're a die-hard Subspecies fan, or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends, try watching Subspecies 1-3 because they're the best you're gonna get from director Ted Nicholau+dvd
"Fox Faith" get a clue+N+Peter Hartlaub of The San Francisco Chronicle sums up the film's lesson like this: "Keep disobeying your parents and eventually you'll get your way." and I agree with him. This film is touted as being christian, is marketed through christian distributors and even comes with a bible study guide. I, however, could not find anything "chrisitian" about it other than it was relatively clean..but to me just being relatively clean does not make it christian. I am a christian and I consider a movie as such when it portrays values such as; respect, honesty, and honoring your parents even when it doesn't seem fair. This film does not portray those values. If you just like horses and are looking for a decent film then you may like this one.+dvd
Eight Men Out+P+The film is fantastic for all baseball lovers, history lovers, and anyone who wishes to escape for a few hours.  No baseball fan should miss this one+dvd
Stick with import+N+Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though+dvd
Don't buy this compilation......+N+These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu.  However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this )  Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way+dvd
At last-they've got SpongeBob on DVD+P+Wow! Now people without cable can see some episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants! This DVD contains some popular episodes, such as "Texas" with the song "I Want To Wake Up In Texas", and the episode, "F.U.N." with the FUN song. The DVD also has the episode, "The Graveyard Shift" which would have been good for the next DVD, "Halloween.+dvd
Van Damme fans only...+N+I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away+dvd
disney's flubber+P+I think it is a great movie. I bought it for my grandson he loved it+dvd
Transvestite Speaks Out+N+Sadly... when Ann Coulter (a transvestite - or possibly even a transgender patient him/herself?) launched her patently absurd & lame attack on John Edwards' sexuality (never in question before Ann's pitiful attack)... she lost all credibility... even with her beloved far right. If she can't argue the politics then I suggest she simply shut up. For this reason... and so many others... I have absolutely no interest in anything further to do with Ann Coulter. She gives Conservatism a bad name+dvd
The devil's in the details+N+Mostly notorious when it was released in 1987 for featuring wholesome sitcom star Lisa Bonet in a sex scene with some nudity (and thereby supposedly offending Bill Cosby), ANGEL HEART has acquired quite a reputation as a cult film since then, some of which is quite deserved for its astonishingly beautiful cinematography and editing. Some of the compositions (particularly two repeated overhead shots of stairwells, one in Harlem and one in New Orleans) are among the most stunning of any film from the 1980s, and the set decorations are similarly out of this world. Though there's also Mickey Rourke's beautiful youthful face (pre-boxing injuries) to be gazed upon, there's really little else to recommend this movie, even if its big twist at the end catches you unawares: the film is basically constructed as a rebus, with various visual (seeming) non sequiturs keying you in to the big narrative surprise at the end. But the big horror moments have almost no suspense built into them, and the acting is fairly shoddy: O'Rourke gives a real hambone performance, and Bonet must be the dullest voodoo priestess ever to appear onscreen. You know what you're in for when the characters have names like "Harry Angel," "Louis Cyphre," "Toots Sweet," and "Epiphany Proudfoot"; even the beautiful look of the film can't overcome the shallowness and dispiritedness of the script+dvd
A step into the past. +P+i remember the good old days, watching labrynth or dark crystal as a kid. this is the one that started it all. i dont quite know why but from that time till today there has been no better devil either. great movie to remind you of those good old times. an absolutely wonderful classic+dvd
Amazon should not sell these titles+N+I believe the quality of this transfer (along with the one for Raise The Red Lantern) is so horrific that it completely ruines the beautiful experience of watching these Gong Li/ Zhang Yimou movies and should not even be offered for sale. Truly Ba+dvd
A Classy Document of a Classic Band+P+This is an illuminating glimpse into the music and song craft of The Band.  Composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer John Simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording "The Band".  This one is for music lovers.  Many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio, with John Simon, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix.  Absolutely fascinating stuff.  Having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years, it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated, with insightful commentary from the artists who created it.  Also fascinating, in more of a train wreck kind of a way, was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.  Both brilliant artists, but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of The Band's fame.  Rick's remarks on the loss of his best friend Richard Manuel left me with chills, knowing that not too many more months from this interview and Rick would be gone from this place as well.  Well worth the bargain price, this will be one of those rare DVD's that I actually return to again and again+dvd
Pretty good, 6 year old LOVES it+P+I've rented several of the Barbie movies with my 6 year old and this is her absolute favorite, so I'm thinking of buying it for her for Christmas. I doubt I'd bother buying any of the others, it's too easy to rent them, but this one stands out for us and she keeps asking to rent it over and over again.  Don't buy this if you expect to share the true story of Rapunzel with your kids; there isn't much here from the original, other than the long hair. But it's an entertaining story (especially if you're a girl under the age of 10!) and it teaches kids the importance of telling the truth and sticking by your friends even when it isn't the easiest thing to do. My daughter and I enjoyed the extras, too.  I've probably seen this one about 8 times so far, and I can honestly say as a parent that it's not bad: It doesn't have me running out of the room each time my daughter asks to start it up, and it doesn't drive me nutty over awful, repetitive songs+dvd
Finally, a 14 episode set from Funimation!+P+So looks like the guys at Funi are going to release 14 episodes from season four in a two dvd special edition.  Looks like we get the following, and if you don't believe me, go to the Tmnt website for hard evidence.  Here's what to expect acording to the press release from Funi.        Episodes include Still Nobody, The ancient One, Cyon of the Shredder, Prodigal Son, Outbreak, Trouble with Augie, Tale of Master Yoshi, Return of Savanti parts 1 and 2, Adventures in Turtle-sitting, Good Geens parts 1 and 2, and as for that 14th episode, could be Ninja Tribunal or Insane in the Membrane.  Maybe they'll go ahead with Insane, and just include the Tribunal episode in its own 14 episode release, if this one sells good, that is.  I don't see why they couldn't up the ep content to 15 and just go ahead and give us both.  But check the tmnt website for that press release if you're interested.  And looks like the price is pretty low too.  An excelent buy.  But your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine, folks.  Maybe as the sept 12 release date draws nearer, someone can confirm the last episode we're getting.  Oh and I forgot Samurai Tourists.        Maybe they'll go ahead and give us Insane in the Membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four.  And hopefully, we'll get Ninja Tribunal plus the 13 episodes that complete that arc at a later date.  Maybe by Christmas?  I hope so, anyway.        And do I really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four?  Well, I think I will anyway.  But if you're lookin for spoilers, you won't find them here.        Leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of Shredder and Karai last season.  And after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control, Splinter sends him to Japan to find himself with the help of Yoshi's old master, the ancient one.  But while Leo is gone, a new Shredder suddenly attacks the turtles, and Leo must return home and do battle with this new foe.  Well, maybe not a new foe, but a foe with an attitude ajustment though.        Also in this portion of the season, slime from agent Bishop's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers(see Aliens among us from Vol. 3.7: Hun on the Run) has mutated several animals near the turtles' home.  Its up to them to end this outbreak, but one of them is infected by one of the creatures, causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast.  Now the turtles must make a deal with the devil, so to speak, in order to have their brother restored.  Agent Bishop SAYS he has a cure.  But in order for Bishop to administer it, our heros must steal a valuable object for him.  They must invade the stronghold of the new Shredder and steal the Heart of Tengu, but there are darker forces at work here.  Even Bishop doesn't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world.        So save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in September! +dvd
Could have been put together allot better!!!+N+I'm a huge fan of Electronic Dance Music and anything to do with this genre; I've been to both the huge acts and the underground parties. This movie had good intensions, but the way it came together is a little lame. I recommend One Beautiful Day if you like coming of age movies to do with electronic movies.+dvd
Baseball's Glory Days+P+As I was 20 in 1961, and a Mickey Mantle fan,the film brought back a lot memories. Those were Baseball's glory days. It been going downhill ever since. I live near Chicago, and I wasn't aware of the extent of N.Y. bias against Roger+dvd
Two cute girls and a plan gone awry+P+I justed watched SAMARITAN GIRL tonight.  This Korean film, directed by Kim Ki-Duk, features Ji-Min Kwak as Yeo-jin, a high school girl who runs a small prostitution business with her friend Jae-young (played by the cute as a button Yeo-reum Han, acting here under the name Min-jeong Seo, according to Imdb.)  These two girls are best friends and seem to do everything together.  To raise money so they can fly to Europe, Jae-young comes up with the prostitution idea.  She sleeps with the clients and actually enjoys it, while Yeo-jin makes the arrangements and keeps the money.  Things go bad one day when two cops follow Jae-young up to her liaison in a motel, and attempting to escape, jumps from the window to her death.  Yeo-jin is distraught at the loss of her best friend and beset with guilt over having the money entrusted to her.  To alleviate her conscience, she arranges liaisons with Jae-young's clients to give back the money.  However, when her father, a cop on the vice squad, discovers what she's up to, things take a dark turn for both himself and his daughter's customers.  This film seemed like several in one.  It starts off as a story about the friendship of two school girls, turns into a tale of about guilt and redemption, and then turns into a story about revenge and a lack of communication.  I'd like to have seen more of the friendship (with more screen time for Yeo-reum Han), and some things seem rather far-fetched, but it's a thought provoking film and I liked it overall.  The film is presented on DVD by Tartan Video and has one very serious flaw that I've never seen before on disc:  for the last ten or fifteen minutes, there's a quite visible bar running vertically through the picture about a third of the way in from the left.  It's as though I was watching a broadcast with a weak signal.  I couldn't believe I was seeing such a thing.  Did anybody at Tartan look at this transfer before committing it to disc?  I'm thinking of writing them to say that, after seeing this, I must seriously question getting any more of their titles.  Otherwise, the film is presented at 1.78:1, widescreen enhanced.  The picture is okay but not great - kind of on the dark side, and certainly not among the sharpest that I've seen.  It is watchable, though.  I listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it sounded like a regular stereo soundtrack with no special audio effects.  An interesting film, and I'd like to see more by this director, but the transfer problem at the end is unforgiveable.    Ratings:  Film - 4 stars;  DVD transfer - 2 stars+dvd
It's a snore+N+I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on+dvd
Decent  "B level" science fiction+N+Entertaining but not in the same league as Star Trek, the new BattleStar Galactica, Buffy, or Roswell. Never explained why every alien they meet speaks English, especially as language barriers were important in the original movie. Some of the acting is wooden, especially Teal'C and Carter. However, Jackson, O'Neil and Hammond are well-acted characters. The plot lines do not bear a lot of scrutiny+dvd
If you've never been to a Wiggles concert...+P+You'll love this video!  Even though I've only been to two concerts, I felt a little cheapened watching this because it kind of slaps you in the face with how canned the whole Wiggles concert experience is.  We got this for my son's 3rd Christmas, and he has happily watched it a few times.  It's a great way to relive the concert experience!  The feature with King Mondo doing "Eagle Rock" is good, too+dvd
WEAK+N+If you want to waste two hours of your life watching a movie about the most implausible hooker in the universe, you are in luck.  Jane Fonda plays a call girl with a sensitive pimp and harmless businessmen for clients. She goes to a psychoanalyst on a regular basis to moan about her failed attempts to become an actress/model. All we see of her on the job is having sex with a few passive businessmen who meet up with her in high rise hotels and wait for Fonda to guide them through the act of sex.  Donald Sutherland stars as the world's mopiest detective investigating the disappearance of some offscreen character. Did I mention he is a man of few words?  Most of Sutherland's screen time is spent in mute staring and trying not to react to anything.  When he does say a few lines it is in a mumble that registers no emotion.  His investigation consists of going up to hookers and asking them if they would like to be interviewed by him.    99% of the movie is Sutherland and Fonda wandering around from one setting to another asking extras if they know something. Like a guided tour+dvd
Unique Kung Fu Delight+P+Steve Oedekerk (the writer of the film BRUCE ALMIGHTY) directed, wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof. Though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking, KUNG POW is genuinely remarkable, in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 Chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them. Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.  Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does "feel" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.  SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.) To further the bad dubbing effect, Oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera+dvd
I walked out of the Theater on this flick....+N+I was a Sophomore in HS and went to this cartoon with my cousins, What a mistake! I walked out and sat in the car till it was over.  It was awful.  I think it is sick that even grown ups think this is so amusing to watch cartoon characters have sex.  I wouldn't even rate it a "1" star.  More like Zero Stars+dvd
Incredible, Uplifting, and Inspiring+P+After watching "Tupac Resurrection," I found myself with a much greater appreciation for 2Pac's music.  I was also amazed how 2Pac's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if Tupac himself was narrating his own documentary.  Although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life (and death), it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2Pac's narration.    Tupac lived an amazing life, even if it was tragically cut short.  Tupac Resurrection, then, is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of Tupac or rap in general.  I watched this movie with my brother, who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all, and even he enjoyed the movie.  It is just that 2Pac was such a charismatic, intelligent, and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to.  And, this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life, from birth to death.  If you are a fan of 2Pac, this is a must-have.  As I said before, after watching "Tupac Resurrection" I gained an even greater appreiciation of his music.  Even for those that aren't fans of Tupac or even rap in general, I highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing, becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium, and then dies a tragic, early death.  The only thing I have left to do is quote Roger Ebert's review, because I really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says, "Let's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music, but might have it in you to see one. This is the one."  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Rap fans or not.  Tupac fans or not+dvd
grief and chagrin, outstandingly portrayed+P+This is a brilliant film, about a woman whose life is shattered, first by untimely death and then but the discovery of betrayal.  This is te best film of the trilogy by far, with outstanding performances by Binoche and others.  This is a real woman, who suffers and learns to renew herself, through art and love.  I was deeply moved by this film, totally drawn in+dvd
1 star if you own the extended version, 5 stars if you just want the movies+N+I, like a lot of others was kind of annoyed when I saw another issue out.  I own the extended and theatrical releases already.  BUT, I had to buy them to see the "Never before behind the scenes documentary". To be honest, I wasn't impressed.  A few funny things, but all in all...I could have lived without it.  It's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason.  The Extended version extra material is so far superior.  That's my opinion. But like me, you may just have to have it! Shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us! If you don't own the movies and are generally not into the extras, this is definitely a good way to go,  You get both versions and in a very smart package+dvd
An Excellent Suspense/Thriller (And Baroness Curtis Is HOT!!!)+P+This is a very good Suspense/Thriller about a mother played by Jamie Lee Curtis who abandoned her family and now she wants custody and access to her sons. Ms. Curtis gives a sensual and yet chilling performance in this movie as the Sociopathic mother who will not stop at anything to achieve this goal. Ms. Curtis' Father is Tony Curts who is Hungarian just like my Father was and I must say they do make  beautiful daughters from that country. This movie ROCKS and so does Ms. Curtis who is now a Baroness in Real Life+dvd
A Production of Peerless Quality...+P+Denholm Elliott superbly essays the role of John Le Carre's spymaster-detective GEORGE SMILEY with verve and intellectual panache. Alec Guinness(who immortalized the iconic,laconic scholar-aristocrat Intelligence Officer in Le Carre's masterpiece TINKER,TAILOR,SOLDIER,SPY)finds a worthy peer in otherwise peerless production. MURDER explores the better and baser qualities of human nature comprising relics and affectations of British class hierarchy.Joss Ackland is repugnantly fascinating as embittered,narcissistic pederast whose pretensions(and Miltonic sense of "injured merit")court disaster and encapsulate cultural and political decadence.  A MURDER OF QUALITY is PM political fable that touches Shakespearean(Dostoyevskian)depths both tragic and darkly "comic". Smiley and former WWII Circus/MI6 colleague,Alisa Brimley(played with characteristic acumen by Glenda Jackson)are heroes of "the greatest generation". In their nation's "finest hour",they fought and won against forces of barbarism and EVIL. But TODAY the Murder of Quality...in resentment;pettiness;and politics of envy and entitlement...sweeps across The Western World. John Le Carre's British Public School epic dramatically comprises consequences of "living"-off heroism and sacrifice of others while wallowing in Hollow man/woman self-pity and(ironic to the max!)self-apotheosis.(7 stars)      +dvd
A nice film by Lasse Hallström+P+This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  "My Life as a Dog" known in Sweden as "Mitt Liv Som Hund" is inarguably Hallström's best known foreign language film. Though he has done other films they are American or British made. "Chocolat," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and "Something to Talk About." He is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous Swedish pop group, ABBA.  The film is about a 12 year old boy in 1950's Sweden. He is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill, his antics prevent her from recovering, so he is sent to live with his uncle. He meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople. He often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is.  The film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas Sweden and some fine photography also. It remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards. It won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the AMPAS. Though it is described by many people as a family film, it got a PG-13 rating in the US. Mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue. There is a half second of full frontal female nudity, though non-sexual, it still may be a cause for parental concern. The other scene involves material that I feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it.  The special features on the Criterion DVD include Lasse Hallström's first film, "Ska vi gå hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt?" which translates to, "Shall We Go to My Place or Your Place or Each Go Home Alone?" This film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children.  There is also a theatrical trailer and an interview with Lasse Hallström. The liner notes also include a special notation about the film by Kurt Vonnegut.  Fans of Swedish cinema will enjoy this release+dvd
The Fresh Prince Has Been A Bad Boy+P+It only took me 8 years, but I was finally inspired (by Will Smith recently filming "I Am Legend" right in my neighborhood) to see Enemy of the State. And it was a good 2 hours and 10 minutes of time well spent.  Will Smith is on a roll...has been on a big screen roll ever since Bad Boys (1995). It seems that he always plays the same character: confident, smart talking, tough, funny. But the redundancy works...every time. It worked in Enemy of the State too.  Like a lot of other Will Smith movies ("Independence Day", "Men in Black", "I, Robot", "Hitch"), Enemy of the State is a thoroughly entertaining movie that keeps you in your seat. It's got a great story with some great actors.  And post 9/11, the subject of government surveillance is even more on topic. Can anyone say, "The Patriot Act"?  Enemy of the State is classified as a thriller. A thriller is supposed to be exciting, full of suspense, intrigue and mystery. Enemy of the State does not disappoint.  A worthy rental.+dvd
Really great fun!+P+I picked this up in VHS at a video store for 99 cents, figured it would be an okay piece of entertainment. Boy, was I surprised! This is an excellent bit of comedy, beautifully acted, wonderfully edited, totally enjoyable entertainment! The dysfunctional family dynamics are hysterical, the young people are attractive and funny, the plot twists are very unexpected, and it's simply beautifully done. Don't miss this one! +dvd
Excellent Shipment & Product is Fine Too!+P+I appreciated the tracking information and purchase confirmation. It was a speedy delivery and I had no problems with this one (1) item+dvd
beauty and the beast! the most touching romance of all the disney princess collection+P+this si without a doubt the most moving of all the disney princess movies I've seen. The ending of this movie had me in tears. When i first saw this movie i though the beast really had died and it was too late for him and then it turned out that belle's love for the beast brought him back to life and broke the evil spell that was cast on him by the enchantress. the ending couldn't have been more perfect. I'm so glad to own the dvd. The picure and sound quality is perfect. I now have the entire princess collection on dvd. Thanks amazon for carrying these out of print titles+dvd
Content weak but video is interesting+N+ABC dives into the Kennedy killing with this video showing how the lone-nut Oswald did the killing alone, just as the Warren Commission said he did.  The main focus of the video seems to be to show why all of the conspiracy-theory people are mistaken and misled.  Unfortunately, the content is sufficiently weak that the video's ability to persuade will be limited to those who are completely unfamiliar with the facts.  It's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like:  1) the Parkland Hospital doctors in the ER who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of Kennedy's neck, an exit wound on the back of his head, and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film, 2) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of Kennedy's wounds, 3) the second bullet fired by lone-nut Oswald passed through Kennedy's body, through Connally's body, and lodged in Connally's leg, later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the Warren Commission, 4) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard, hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll, and seeing the limousine momentarily stop, 5) Oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in 6 seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots, 6) Oswald decided not to fire when the Kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him, had traveled several hundred yards, and was moving away, 7) Oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in 90 seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots, 8) fire a bolt-action rifle 3 times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin' test given hours later by the Dallas PD, and 9) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting, when the president came driving by.    If none of these things are a stretch, then you will find ABC's work highly persuasive.  Otherwise, you will start to wonder why ABC is cranking out this kind of stuff and...perhaps...even become a conspiracy nut.  Even if you do lean towards the conspiracy point of view, though, you will find this video well-produced and interesting. +dvd
Over Done+N+"Over done" is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a "stolen" video camera. +dvd
Five Early British gems+P+This box set contains five Ealing Studios comedies from the fifties that are just great examples of this genre of films. I had seen Whiskey Galore and a Run for your Money before so the other three were new to me. I liked the Titfield Thunderbolt the best and the Maggie the least, but all are fine movies with typical English humor and good casts (Look for Charles Hawtry of "Carry On" fame in Passport to Pimlico). The set is a bit pricy, but if you love the British comedies of this era, it's not to be missed+dvd
big move, great cast.+P+With a very interesting script, and a group of high caliber actors. it is always an imposible not to make a great movie.- Kevin Spacey,Russell Crowe,Kim Bassinger,Danny de Vito and all the others put together a classic in this type of movie+dvd
Terrible+N+We struggled through this - luckily we didn't pay to see it. (My stepdaughter owns it, and lent it to me.) A waste of time+dvd
NOT RECOMMENDED FIELDS+N+PASSPORT VIDEO, a North Hollywood, CA, outfit, in their search for quality, match that other outfit, ALPHA Video, for getting their hands on old, beat-up, third or fourth generation 8mm prints of films.  The sound track is fixed, but the picture is dreadful, not remastered or brought up to date at all, which, with our technical equipment is possible!  They have simply put these very old junk prints on DVD. The price is high for this mess.  There ought to be a law against putting out this kind of quality on DVD, I won't put the word for it here--I'll leave that to George Carlin--BUT! don't buy it+dvd
Not so good!+N+I tought that this movie was going to tell you the real secrets of Air Force One, but it only talks about the story of the airplane since Nixon, and then it just tells you that it is cassified everything about it, so not so many details. I didn't like it+dvd
a beautiful portrait of humans+P+I really think this movie is great, but I don't think most people would. The love story between Jeremy Davies and Milla Jovovich is just so sweet and quiet. To be honest, I think that was the best thing about the movie, the realtionship of these two characters that was so moving. This movie just portrays the fragility and emotional complexity of people so beautifully+dvd
An Awful Adaptation+N+The costumes were great....but this movie did no justice to the novel.  "Cousin Bette" the novel is excellent , "Cousin Bette" the movie, is dreadful.  I understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie, but these changes were awful and they took something very important (the Baroness) away from the story...  If you haven't read the novel, you will probably find this movie to be decent.  If you have read the novel, be prepared to be very disappointed+dvd
great movie..hddvd worthless+N+Goodfellas is a classic "cult " movie and there is no doubt about it.But sorry when it comes to talk about High definition the rating goes to 2 stars maximum. There is nothing to be amazed in the HD transfer of this movie because purely and simply there is no HD such a 3D lookalike pictures,deep contrast  etc... It seems HD need today's technology to  render effects.  In comparaison  "Ray " is rendering all the amazing good things of HD in pictures and sound+dvd
What only 7 discs?????+P+Make some room on your DVD shelf next to your Yankeeographys because MLB Productions have a hit on their hands.  They answered the 2004 Boston Red Sox box set with a Yankee compilation that was second to none.  While the Red Sox set included only the 2004 World Series the Yankees collection includes some of the greatest World Series Games of the Joe Torre Era.  The Red Sox set is guaranteed to last 86 years so it should keep the Sox fans happy for a long time.  This set includes five complete World Series Games, all of which are Yankee victories of course.  And if that wasn't enough, in addition to the complete games there are two bonus disks.    As exciting as the complete games are, unfortunately it doesn't include John Sterling and Michael Kay like the YES Network Yankee Classics do.  It does include the original national broadcasts, which has commentators that feature Bob Costas, Joe Buck, Tim McCarver and Joe Morgan.  The picture couldn't be sharper and it does seem to be a full featured DVD as opposed to some past releases.    The full games included 1996 Game 4 which features Jimmy Leyritz leading the Yanks back from a 6-0 deficit to a 8-6 extra inning triumph that tied the series at 2 all.  The next game is another come from behind victory.  The third game of the 1998 series features the Bombers beating San Diego ace reliever Trevor Hoffman.  The third complete game is another game three, this one again against the Braves that features a walk off homer by Chad Curtis.  Mariano Rivera took a win this time around instead of his usual save. The forth complete game DVD is a Game 5 series ender against the Mets in 2000, the first Subway Series since 1956.  The Yankees won it in the top of the ninth on a single by super sub Louie Sojo.  Mike Stanton got the win in relief of Andy Pettitte.  The loss went to former Yankee farmhand Al Leiter.    The final complete game while a Yankee victory is unusual in the fact that the Yankees lost this series to the Arizona Diamondbacks.  What made this game unique was that this was the 911-year and due to the suspension of baseball that year at midnight of that game it became November.  It was the first baseball game played in November.  And Derek Jeter homered in the bottom of the tenth thus becoming the first "Mr. November".    The two Bonus DVDs are worth the price of admission on their own.  They include all the MLB World Series videos plus a plethora of bonus footage that includes Roger "Rocket" Clemens 2000 ALSC game 4 masterpiece. Other inclusions are highlights from Gooden's No Hitter, David Cone's and David Well's Perfect Games, Jeter's ALDS series saving flip, and many other highlights by names like David Justice, Jim Leyritz, and Paul O'Neill.  There is abundance of behind the scenes footage that includes locker room, interviews and press conferences and much, much more.      The packaging is a Trivia Buffs delight as it is full of boxscores, highlights and facts.  It will jar your memory reading the cases alone.   These disks are a must have for Yankee fans.   As soon as I posted the banners I saw many of you pre order these fine DVDs.  So what are the rest of you waiting for?    +dvd
Great movie!+P+The movie isn't your typical American hero type war movie. Like the characters that develop through the movie+dvd
Wellman Adaptation Lacks Suspense...+N+After watching the fabulous bonus features on this DVD (a biography of William 'Wild Bill' Wellman with observations by Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter, another bio of "Track" author Walter Van Tilburg Clark, a look at actual mountain lions and their habitat, and more), I realized I held a 'minority opinion' of the film, itself, compared to many of the reviewers you'll read, here; I think it is stagy, lacks the sense of dread and palpable suspense of the novel, and doesn't 'hold up' as well as most of the director's work.  A tale of a dysfunctional family at it's boiling point, and the impact a nearly primordial panther has, in changing their lives, the characters, with the exception of always watchable Robert Mitchum, as the domineering middle son, are all either boring, frustratingly indecisive, or downright unlikable. Oldest son William Hopper, best-known as 'Paul Drake' in television's "Perry Mason", is the dreamer, who 'bonds' with the environment, but lacks the instinctive power to defeat the cat, and never comes across as more than wishy-washy; bitter spinster sister Teresa Wright offers a one-note portrayal that soon becomes grating; youngest son Tab Hunter is so wimpy that you quickly lose interest in him; Philip Tonge, the loquacious alcoholic father, whose drinking problem, in the novel, is tragic, here becomes a stereotyped comic drunk, with hidden bottles of liquor providing 'comic relief'; Diana Lynn, as Hunter's girl, tries hard, but never seems more than a minor character in the proceedings; even legendary Beulah Bondi, as the greedy, Bible-spouting, mean-spirited mother, seems to simply channel her 'bad mom' portrayal from the "What if?" sequence of "It's a Wonderful Life". Worst of all, ex-Little Rascal Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer, encased in phony-looking 'old age' make-up to 'pass' as a 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man, looks neither believable, or comfortable in the role.  With a farm set that looks patently artificial (and obviously on a sound stage), the outdoor scenes, shot at Mount Rainier, must take up the slack; sadly, despite the creativity in using high contrasts to make the colors achieve a 'black and white' look, the book's greatest asset, the constant, frightening 'unseen' presence of the malevolent cat was, to me, never achieved, despite a Mitchum monologue as he gradually succumbs to helpless fear; in fact, Hunter's final confrontation with the cat is handled so 'routinely' that you can't understand what all the fuss was about!  The film was a big letdown! +dvd
Oh, sorry, I must have been snoring.+N+The Butcher (Edward Gorsuch, 2006)  And here we have, yes, another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie. Bad acting. Increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule (instead of straight kids having sex, there's a pair of lesbians, who must, of course, suffer gruesome ends-- this isn't a spoiler, as the first occurs in the extended opening scene. So the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring. Silly, anyone?). Awful, awful script. Incredibly predictable plot twist. Yeah, there's really nothing good to say about this movie. Some wag on the IMDB boards called it (forgive my paraphrasing) a bad remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre combined with a bad remake of The People Under the Stairs, and he's right. +dvd
great b grade horror!+P+I went into watching this film a little aprehensive. I love horror movies but 99% are usually never scary in the least bit. (usually they are just very fun to watch) This movie was creepy as hell and has a high amount of tension that continues to build. It actually freaked me out which is very hard to do. this film and malevolance are the only 2 horror films to give me that gut feeling of fright that I crave from this genere of movies in about the past year or so. My dog even started growling at the tv and barking being the savage gaurd dog that he is. If you love horror films than this one is a must see, the story is very similar to and is basicly a mix of wrong turn and the texas chainsaw massacre, and they pull it off very wel+dvd
What in Hell?+N+What in Hell is wrong with the AH sets? Why do we have to buy the same movies that are REPEATED the each box set. It's bad enough that we suffer at the hands of studio's that keep adding supposedly &quot;newly found&quot; extras. I Love extras but being &quot;Force to get the new material each time is outraegous.I have three versions of Star wars and two or three of the Godfather.Several of the same movies are repeated in the box sets.Watch out,you are being taken advantaged of.  Bummer . . . +dvd
Wears well+P+I first saw this movie on release as a teenager, and thought it was a great scary movie. The main reason I bought it now was to get a hold of the great Jerry Mulligan soundtrack.  The whole family have enjoyed the film now, and leaving out the 70's gear and hairstyles, its a great thriller+dvd
Wonderful CD~UNBELIEVABLE DVD! +P+Listeners familiar with SMILE CD are aware that it's Brian Wilson's vindication as one of few genuine artists to emerge from popular music phenomenon called(BLUES had a baby and they named it...)Rock'n'Roll. After transcending Fun/Fun/Fun epoch of The Beach Boys(perhaps America's greatest touring group)Wilson's PET SOUNDS legend began.GOOD VIBRATIONS promised emergence of stellar American composer to match Copeland,Gershwin and Berstein.Then came relatively brief era (ars gratias guitarists)of flash guitar soloists[Hendrix;Clapton;Beck;Page;Santana;ending with Knopfler~Roger McGuinn--like Dylan--remains poet minstrel,no mere axeman.]where Wilson's work was dismissed as "kid stuff".Few musicians recognized Brian Wilson had transformed the recording studio into an INSTRUMENT of"infinite"possiblity;and had employed magnificent vocal and instrumental harmonic layering in radical fashion unappreciated and inimitable.(With writers like Van Dyke Parks he began constructing worthy lyric-literature.)Psychotic crash came.Drugs;intra-battles with Dad,Mike Love & Capital quenched the creative wick;Wilson seemed destined to remain Beach "Boy"para-gone.   Hints found in hymns like 'TIL I DIE brought a new legion of listeners and musicians(THE WONDERMINTS)to the rescue.The rest is  history.His wife Melinda and men like Darian Sahanaja and Jeffrey Foskett brought Brian & his music back to life culminating in SMILE. It's experience to challenge listeners and reward all but the most close minded. In this DVD video even the skeptical can enjoy a performance of popular music to rival classical works of by-gone masters transcending "THE CONCERT"show as art.You don't have to like it,but you MUST admire its verve and joyeous daring. Reviewers have discussed the DVD package;extras;and techinical quality.Unconvinced might recall observation by Dylan regarding Brian Wilson's deafness in one ear: "He should donate the good one to the SMITHSONIAN."SMILE~DVD is triumph of musicianship, techno-artistry and HEART.Amidst dreck commonly applauded(in lit. --cf:Da Vinci Code--music;film;painting)this "road-not-taken"of accessible,wondefully happy music is Ars Populi to make all but most jaded pseudos SMILE.         +dvd
BEYOND INSPIRATION+P+Being from New England, it is easy to say that this to me was one of the greatest things that ever happened, ever, the amazing 2001 season from the N.E. Patriots. Even if you ain't that into sports, maybe just inspirational films that put a huge sh** eating grin on your face... this is a DVD to own (at least to check out..) I of course was issued a copy of this after the Superbowl win in 2002, being from New England, but only dug it out recently to view it. Besides telling the story in detail about the season, game for game, it is also produced very well, by using the real NFL film footage, that is much more in depth than what we all saw on TV back when it happened. Right on the sidelines with the players, you get to watch (half the time you can see that they are almost as amazed with themselves as we were) I guess I should spare the story, because it is written in every other review here, and really its much better shown on the DVD, but to remember the state of the team at that point...  Last place underdogs the WHOLE season. Even as the team barrel rolled and got bigger and better, game for game, no one believed they would do it (maybe us New Englanders did, but we were still crossing our fingers pretty damned hard).. but everytime the stakes got higher, the team got hotter (not to mention a few divine miracles, like the enormous hurricane during the Raiders game) You just gotta watch this thing, and see how crazy the team really got, spectacular moves all over. This is one of those sports stories that should grace the big screen... a story you couldn't make up. Rock on PATS!   P.S. Regarding the tribute to 9/11, god bless to all.... but I REALLY hate U2+dvd
Bob Newhart Season 2+P+I would HIGHLY receommend buying this set!  A true classic tv show continues with it's second season!!!   A MUST HAVE for any classic dvd collection!!  Go back to the 1970's and enjoy!!!+dvd
Wonderful Memories+P+I love this movie, and not only because I am a senior and relate to this era,a wonderful story,wonderful music,and kids of all age's can watch and enjoy. My son can verify that+dvd
Uncut Funk +P+If you are looking for and need special features and clips that are as slick as any music video being produced in 2007, then I'm sorry to say you will be disappointed with The Mothership Connection Live From Houston.  For everyone else, what the DVD chronicles is P Funk the way it sounded and was performed each night in the mid-1970s; you just never knew who may show up to make the concert just a bit more funkier. By the end of the show, the opening act - Sly and The Family Stone - along with Bootsy Collins and members of his Rubber Band are in on the funkified jam.  Recorded in 1976, it was at a time when concerts weren't being chronicled on a nightly basis for possible future use. I would wager that a member of the stage crew decided to capture the gig on tape and it was gathering dust in a vault somewhere before the audio was enhanced about as well as it could have been for release.   What makes this a special gem is the "rough" nature of the video. The band and guest performers were not on stage knowingly making a movie; this is a tour date with all the power, energy & surprises that George Clinton delivered each night to the audience. That in itself makes the DVD an important part of any music collection.      +dvd
Among The Worst Movies of All Time...Avoid It Like the Plague !!!+N+I knew going in that this would not be a masterpiece of filmmaking, but always the optimist, I naively assumed that it may have some redeeming virtues. I was wrong. Every second watching this abomination is a second wasted. The script, acting, direction, sound, cinematography, plot, etc. are just plain awful. Indeed, the overall quality is so low that it cannot be explained simply by a lack of money or talent....it is like some awful inside joke played upon the audience. Don't fall for it. +dvd
A Disgusting Film!+N+This movie absolutely disgusted me!  It's a hideous thinly disguised sado/masochist film.  Whoever produced the movie needs to get some help.  Way too much time was spent showing us the sexual details involved in these horrible murders as if the film maker savored the acts.  It almost seemed like a porn film.+dvd
Four Feathers is a rousing adventure story+P+this is the 7th time this movie has been made and while it may not be the best it is certainly a worthwhile film to watch especially for the spectacular battle scenes. We were fortunate to find a great site to buy it on www.hardtofindrecordings.com as they have it seems every film ever made whether in print or not. I highly recommend both the film and the website+dvd
Read the book instead+N+Just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children; movies have ratings for a reason.  This movie is rated PG-13, which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children.  In this case, it is crude humor. What I don't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience, and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience shouldn't see it+dvd
Movie is great - This DVD release is HORRIBLE+N+Don't buy this.  Seriously.  Someone is bound to release a better version.  This is PAN AND SCAN, cropped at 1:33, and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape...Like a 3/4 inch VHS.  There are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film. And no it's NOT the print.  The film is fine.  It's the transfer.  cheap, cheap, cheap.  The compression is abysmal (notice the obvious scan lines on the titles) and the sound is piss poor.  How is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the US?  Disgraceful+dvd
Blu-ray screws us here!+N+The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie+dvd
Great film, lousy DVD+N+I'm really tired of the shoddy DVD manufacturing used by many studios and distributors.  This is a great film.  I have it on tape.  I was thrilled to see it'd been released on DVD.  I love Italian knock-offs of American films (STREET LAW seems inspired by DEATH WISH), and I'm a Barbara Bach fan.  So I bought this STREET LAW DVD brand new, as soon as Amazon offered it, without waiting for the price to go down.  I unwrap the pristine-looking DVDm pop it into the player, and after a few minutes it pauses.  Then it pauses again.  It pauses constantly throughout the film.  I mean at least once a minute, often several times a minute.  Pause, pause, pause.  Most of the pauses are brief, some last several seconds.  I eventually took out the DVD, cleaned it, but it didn't help.  I suffered through 50 minutes of this film, then gave up.  VHS was a decent format.  Tape had problems, but nowhere near as bad as DVD, with all the skipping and scratching.  (And Google "DVD rot" -- see what comes up.)    Still, changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we'd already bought, so I guess it makes sense for them.  I don't know whether I got a bad copy of STREET LAW, or if this DVD is part of a bad batch, or how widespread the problem is.  But beware+dvd
It watched it on fast forward!+N+Except for two cuties: William Zabka and Dana Ashbrook! Especially Dana who constantly having a hard-on+dvd
Rock bottom+N+From a lifelong lover of L&H films, zero stars, unless negative numbers are an option. These films are lousy through and through, and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them. They are painful to watch and about as humorous as Henry Daniell playing Doctor Moriarty. In deference to the two funniest men who ever lived, these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon Stan and Ollie after Roach sold their contracts.  If you really like Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc L&H set from Amazon.uk. It contains all their shorts (sound and silent) and some of the early movies. It also contains  the foreign language versions, in which L&H and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in Spanish, French, etc. Further, it includes different versions of certain titles.  For "Bonnie Scotland" and "Fra Diavolo," get the separate 2-disc set in NTSC. You'll have to purchase a region-free, PAL converting DVD player, but they are widely available in the United States and will play anything. (Don't buy a cheap one--the good ones are hardly expensive.+dvd
This is still relevant stuff+P+If you want to know why it is such a big deal that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series, you should check this out.  It neatly summerizes all the facts and superstitions that surrounded this team for 86 years, not including the 2003 season.  Watching this on HBO made me a Rex Sox fan over a year ago.  Consider this a condenced first part of a trilogy that includes "Still, We Believe", and whatever Red Sox Championship DVD is soon to come out+dvd
traded how long ago??? and still whining...+N+you forgot 2004.   4-0.  see ya ruth. don't let the door kick you in the *ss on the way out.   signed, the boston red so+dvd
Must-have for Cards fans!!!+P+This DVD set has all 5 games with Detroit, and games 5 and 7 of the Mets series. Of course, commercial free with great audio and video. World Series victories don't come around often, and this set offers a great way to preserve those memories. I have been watching replays of these games on Fox Midwest, but twenty years from now (when the Cards have wrapped up 5 or 6 more WS victories thanks to coach of the year 2021 Albert Pujols) these games will still be preserved for me, long after they are regulars on cable TV. The bonus DVD is neat too, with interviews from many on the team. A lot of funny stuff, with people spraying champagne all over eachother while trying to interview. Good, candid stuff that you don't get to see during the course of a regular season. If you or your loved one is a serious Cardinals fan like I am, this is a must have!!!       -Dav+dvd
Roundtree Shines in Landmark Role+P+The private eye, the mainstay of American cinema, was usually the domain of the Humphrey Bogart types.  Richard Roudtree's John Shaft added more than pigmentation and turtlenecks to the genre.  Roundtree brings an incandescent suaveness and coolness to the screen whether he's browbeating the bad guys, swatting racial insults like they're annoying gnats, or charming the ladies.  Shaft is a classic screen character.  It's unfortunate that "Shaft" is not a classic film.  That can be attributed to a ho-hum storyline involving a Harlem kingpin hiring Shaft to free his kidnapped daughter from Mafia thugs.  With the exception of Shaft, few of the characters in the film transcend the one-dimensional or the stereotypical.  It's on the sheer star wattage of Roundtree that "Shaft" rises above the mundane+dvd
Not So Super+N+In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.  Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:  Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.  Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.  Once said "continent" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.  Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?  Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.  The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.  Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!  I could have made a better movie with my camera phone.+dvd
A Spectacular Movie+P+Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.   The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: "It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles."  Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.   If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.+dvd
Jack's Best Work+P+I can't remember when I saw this one on the big screen.  It was not long after Easy Rider and we had the idea that this Jack Nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70's counter-culture.  He did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting I had ever seen. He out-classed the James Dean's and Marlon Brando's, but not with ease.  Jack was workin' hard, switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood Romeo in five-minute intervals.  No, make that changeable temperament every five seconds, truly an artistic milestone. Throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by Karen Black, sexy and hillbilly; Jessica Simpson, eat your heart out, and you have the couple of the year, 1970.  Jack's father is one of those evil patriarch's that hurt their kids bad, pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love.  Consequently, the siblings are brilliant and eccentric.  The daughter is a frumpy dope.  The older son is a violinist with a neck injury, and then there's handsome Jack, shiftless, moving from bed to bed, crossing the country, a boozing bum.  Back in the Vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life.  Did we have to get a job and get married?  Was everyone in a particular cubbyhole, mail in the funeral?  Hence, we had the counter-culture, drugs, long haired hippies, sexual openness, and shiftless lifestyles. Bob Rafelson's film gives you that, but mercifully, with subtly.  That last scene at the gas station says it all.  I think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing.+dvd
I have not yet received the DVD+N+I have not yet received the DVD, and I contacted the customer's service last month. They sent me a new shipment, but I am still waiting for it+dvd
Ripping, fantastic, classic satire! 4.5 stars!+P+I recall first watching this movie with my ex-friend and I took a trip down the coast. I wasn't really expecting much, pretty much just another slapstick, stupid comedy. But to be totally honest, this movie is really awesome! "Hotshots," ought to have you rolling around the floor in some instances. But first, a look at the "storyline."  Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the son of a famous air ace who died um...tragically in an F-15 crash landing and a terrible mix-up regarding moose hunting season. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a flying wonder. This briefly sums up the main "story," but there are many other smaller stories including that of Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) and Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) who fights his own personal war against the terrible ailment of Wall Eye Vision. That aside, Topper Harley must find out what really happened to his dad and help both his friends and himself to achieve their dreams, even if it goes to ridiculous proportions.  You may think that this is a movie that merely takes the piss out of movies like "Top Gun," "Full Metal Jacket," and "Kickboxer," but...well, you're right. But the satire is clever (yet decidedly idiotic), and it certainly succeeds in making just about everything totally ridiculous. Don't expect realism, objectivenes and logic in this movie - that's not the point of it. It's there as a satire, and really is a classic satirical film of the 1990's. The appeal of "Hotshots" is the sheer stupidity and absurdity of many of the events that take place in the movie, and of course, if you've watched the movies that are being ripped off, you'll really laugh your head off.  The best character has to be Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges). He performs the role of a supposedly "hardened" war-veteran and a man who has seen much conflict with great gusto. It just goes to show that some vets get more violent, others more angry, some sad - and Benson just gets dumber. He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)  All in all, "Hotshots," is a moronic, silly, yet extremely funny and witty slapstick comedy. If you like Monty Python style humour or just love classic slapstick, this movie is undoubtedly for you. Otherwise, if you like intelligent comedy, stay the hell away from "Hotshots." It's not meant to be intelligent, so remember that. But at the end of it all, it'll always be a classic slapstick, silly comedy! Buy it, rent it, steal it today+dvd
Outstanding film for then and now.  But about that title...???+P+As with the other reviewers of this film, I must agree that in its restored and complete form, this is an outstanding film.  The supplemental material is also quite interesting. The themes in this film are just as relevant today as they were when it was made.  Most anything else I could write would be redundant with what others have written.  I will admit that at points I felt the film dragged a bit, having made a point but not moving on.  Maybe I am just too much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today.  One thing I find curious about this movie is the title.  Since the main character is not Colonel Blimp and is really a much deeper character than the cartoon character, I wonder why the film was given the name it was.   I wonder how many people went to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character.  My minor quibbles aside, this is really an excellent film and worth seeing.+dvd
ADAM SANDLER + MOVIE = REALLY BAD CRAP+N+2 bad movies on 1 dvd ***YAWN*** NEX+dvd
Great For What It Is+P+This is a movie that stands on it's own without being a remake. Like the 'Dawn of the Dead' movie in early 2000, this is kind of like a retelling of sorts; The key plotline generally remains the same, but there are some nice changes and unexpected turns as well. I thought the acting overall was really good; Ermey was def. the best surprise here, and the movie had a very sleek look to it that actually complimented it's content. The same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake, and there are some very nice nods to the original; The part w/Leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me..But make no mistake: This movie is brutal in it's violence, and there is alot of it. And while not really 'scary'(except for Sheriff Hoyt...YIKES!!!), this is one intense, horrific ride. The comment on the box read "If you want horror...this IS horror!!".  For once the box speaks the truth. Plus Jessica Biel spends the whole movie is a semi-revealing tank top, so that never hurts as far as I'm concerned..+dvd
A Star Is Born+P+Received it very fast and very happy with the DVD. Well worth the money+dvd
Dreadful+N+Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it+dvd
What's Love got to do with it?+N+Women in Love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve.  To its great credit this Ken Russell film is faithful to the D. H. Lawrence novel upon which it is based+dvd
I've got issues with this DVD, but hey....+P+I'm giving this DVD four stars because the sound is good; it's excellent. I'll overlook the fact there are times he's singing, but the microphone ain't quite there. It's obvious Marilyn Manson puts on one hell of a show. This DVD is rockin', in that sense. Just remember, teeenie boppers, it's theatrics. Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and others, in the late sixties and seventies, did this sh--. Manson ain't nothin' new. It ain't like Satananic theatrics are scary anymore. This DVD borders on a three star rating. It's just that he does put on one hell of a show.  Marilyn just isn't all that and a bag of chips. His theatrics are good, but it's hard to take a man, in a thong like S&M type outfit, seriously. Oh, when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous. I'm sorry. Smellin' his butt with his fingers just gets comical.  I still give it the four stars because I like his music, and this DVD sounds good.  The editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song. Sure it's well done, but it ticks me off when bands do this. Bad Religion did it; but, my lord, how much money does this band have and they release this kind of DVD? It annoys me.  I probably should give this DVD three stars, but it does rock. You just have to get over the fact Marilyn looks like an idiot. He lacks that toughness to pull off the look, if that's possible. If he walked into a bar lookin' like he did with the thong leather pantie crap, a woman would kick his butt...You can reference a Guns 'n' Roses review of mine, I believe even Axyl Rose, in his cute little shorts, could kick Marilyn's butt...  I know that wasn't politically correct, but it's true...  Screw it, I should give it three stars, but the show is flippin' fun..+dvd
Boys Will be Boys !+N+I enjoyed this film , but it has nude childern and I did not think it was needed in the story +dvd
An excellent film with a wonderful pace+P+This film is as slow as a day in your own childhood but with plenty to do and see in the nothing of it all. The vivid transparency  from which the director coaxes  all the many simple details is astonishing. This sort of cinema must be very hard to bring together as almost no one can really pull it off. The Japanese director Ozu was the master of it.And this is about as close as can get to a modern version of him. It's really about the events of two brothers in  childhood  and I can't say enough good about it.  I have seen it twice and I can only imagine it getting better with successive viewings. The only sort of awkward bit for me was when nature talked back in the guise of woodland hags etc.. but I never thought nature needed a human voice to speak for itself+dvd
An Incoherent Let Down+N+After an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe, I had such high hopes for season 4. Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point.   The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: "Alright! I get it - You're evil!" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found.  Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah.   Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds ("Dude, you just saved a puppy!"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley.+dvd

Dissappointing+N+I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.    I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film+dvd
Roger Ebert WOULD love this movie.+N+Come on, folks - it's $7 for a reason.  I was so bored I almost cried.  Why didn't they take the money they wasted on a horrible film like this and go feed an African city for a day+dvd
A sad story; typical werewolf flick in that matter . . .+P+"Ginger Snaps" is an interesting werewolf flick, in that at first we're not quite sure if maybe it isn't just hormones that is making Ginger act so strangely.  But her sister soon learns the truth and sets out to try to cure her.  I don't want to give too many details - I'm certain other reviewers have - but I will say that I liked this movie.  It isn't among my very favorites, but it is a good, solid werewolf horror flick with a few new twists that make it very worthwhile to watch.  Like all traditional werewolf movies, it has a terribly sad ending.  But if we wanted to laugh, we'd watch "Teen Wolf," now, wouldn't we+dvd
It just never gathers steam.+N+Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter.  In fact it was a little boring.  Plus, what language are these folks speaking?  I know it's English, but it might as well be French.  The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable.    Not much to like here.  Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple+dvd
Why waste the cash+N+This is a poor excuse of a movie. The actors are less than right for these rolls. I will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash...+dvd
A very, very bad movie+N+I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.+dvd
Not History+N+This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't.   Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good. +dvd
Pretentious, boring, political, un-real+N+Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.  +dvd
The Narrow Margin+P+A "B" movie that scores a solid "A".  Lean, sharp little thriller packs more thrills and suspense than movies with ten times the budget. Some of the dialogue and delivery go over-the-top, but this only adds to the film's vinegary flavor . The real winner is the story, which holds enough surprises to keep discerning viewers on point throughout. Film noir devotees should pounce on this, and the full set it comes from: Film Noir Classics Collection- Vol. 2+dvd
Pushing the boundaries of traditional documentaries!+P+Ron Mann is a Canadian filmmaker who specializes in documentaries about alternative culture; be it comic books with Comic Book Confidential, a famous dance craze with Twist or marijuana culture with Grass. His latest film, Tales of the Rat Fink, playfully profiles Ed "Big Daddy" Roth who helped popularize the customization of cars in the 1950s. Roth saw automobiles as much more than just modes of transportation but rather blank canvasses just waiting to be adorned with his stylish artwork or to be rebuilt from the ground up in his own unique way.  Mann does a fantastic job of taking us back to the `50s with period music and plenty of archival footage. However, his documentary is far from traditional as he has Roth narrate his own life but voiced by actor John Goodman. Mann also gives several classic cars their own voice as they tell their own story and how they contributed to hot rod car culture. It's an unusual move that takes a little getting used to but for those who have seen Mann's other documentaries it is merely a natural progression of his idiosyncratic style - kind of like Roth himself.  Mann animates still photographs and instead of having someone drone on about the different kinds of paint jobs, shows it through stylized animation techniques and footage of cars being customized. Throughout it all, he has Roth's most famous creation, Rat Fink (his answer to Mickey Mouse - a bright green mutant rat - whom he had grown tired of and created a symbol of everything that was cool and dangerous about the hot rod culture), bridges each segment via animated interludes and accompanied by the surf music of the Sadies. Tales of the Rat Fink does an excellent job immersing us in the custom car culture, how it came to be and its distinctive characteristics. This documentary takes a nostalgic look back at a time when cars had their own distinctive look; they were works of art - something that is missing today in our current homogenous culture. Its unorthodox approach may put off some but it does mirror the gonzo the look of Roth's artwork and takes it away from the stuffy confines of traditional documentaries.  "Big Daddy Lives!" is a rare, archival interview with Roth who talks about how he designs cars and the criteria he used to do this. This extra provides fascinating insight into the man and his work.  "Ratfink Reunion." To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rat Fink, Roth and Von Dutch did a customized paint job on a car together. It's great to see these two artists doing what they do best.  "Big Daddy's Garage" features galleries of his rough sketches for t-shirt designs, stills from the 2006 Detroit Autorama that featured a collection of many of Roth's classic cars, samples from the Rat Fink comic strip, and other artists' interpretation of Rat Fink.  "Interview with director Ron Mann." A friend turned him onto Roth's work in the 1990s and in 2000 he decided to make a film about the man but when he died suddenly in 2001 Mann shelved the project. A few years later, he got the idea to tell Roth's story from the point-of-view of his cars.  "Deleted Scene" is a brief clip that shows the Rat Fink merchandise explosion with model kits, t-shirts, hats, etc.  Also included is the theatrical trailer.  Finally, there is a music video for the Sadies who provided the music for the documentary. It's animated and features Rat Fink with members of the band+dvd
Must Have For SG1 Fans+P+The movie that started it all - Anyone who loves SG1 needs to have this movie+dvd
Water-logged+N+Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.  In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)    The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.   Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.  +dvd
Musically Thrilling, but Video Record of this Immaculate Show a little disappointing+P+I remember this show very well.Just as the sun dipped out of sight the stage lights went on and the band blasted into "Pearly Queen" and "Medicated Goo" and it was like muscial heaven hearing this stuff actually played live (after hearing it so many times on CD). The only way to really experience TRAFFIC is live and this tour was the last chance to do that (now that Wood and Capaldi are both gone).  TRAFFIC's sound remains unique, its never really been imitated. And this band has never received much radio attention (save the occasional  "Dear Mr. Fantasy") and though everyone knows who Steve Winwood is, a lot of people still don't know TRAFFIC's music. But thats fine with me, they are like a well kept secret and this allowed us fans to be able to actually afford tickets to see them when they came through our towns in the summer of '94.  Another advantage of this bands notoriety-lesness is that none of these songs sound dated. In fact much of the TRAFFIC catalogue (with the exception of a few psychedelic numbers on their first two albums)sounds timeless (I'm thinking here especially of the JOHN BARLEYCORN and WHEN THE EAGLE FLIES albums). Masterfully played and highly evocative folk and jazz as well as good ol' blues-based rock does not date. Hearing these styles played next to each other as well as mixed together is as exciting as music gets. I must say,though, that the sole number played from their new album FAR FROM HOME called "Mozambique" sounds a bit too much like SANTANA. That doesn't mean its not a good song and I love SANTANA but it didn't make me want to buy FAR FROM HOME.    I was not a first generation TRAFFIC fan but I became interested in the band in the early 90's so this tour came along at just the right time for me. I've never been a Steve Winwood fan and his solo stuff just seems weak and souless to me. I would say his solo stuff sounds like a watered down radio friendly TRAFFIC or a TRAFFIC without the imagination but to my ears his solo stuff just doesn't sound like TRAFFIC at all.  With the SPENCER DAVIS GROUP and with BLIND FAITH (and a live DVD of BLIND FAITH is now available as well) and especially with TRAFFIC, however, Winwood made music that is absolutely unique and has that unforgettable magic to it that few folk/rock/jazz/blues groups or groups of any kind ever capture.   This was really a great show, and the art work that was displayed behind the band was perfect, mysterious and a bit surreal though in a very appealing way, so the show was evocative to the ear and the eye.  Plus it was summertime, outside, and a river flowed quietly behind the stage as the band played.  I don't think I stopped grinning through the whole set.   That said I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD as it just didn't match my own memory of this show.  The filmmaking here is just plain amateurish so as a collection of great songs this works, but as a concert artifact I think its much less succesful.  That amateurism might have worked had the filmmakers simply employed handmade cameras for that would have created an improvised spontaneous feel to go along with the spontneous improvised music. The filmakers should have taken a more subdued, as well as maybe a bit more avant-garde approach, but, instead, the filmamkers got busy and decided to decorate or trash a perfectly good concert video with some unforgivably cheesy and painfully obvious special effects and visual metaphors (traffic lights, time-lapse highway travel, traffic)which were nowhere near as subtle and evocative as the graphics that adorned the stage. These 'special' effects were just not that special, and they give the video all of the visual mystery and excitement of a local televison commercial.  The idea, apparently, was to share with the DVD audience the feel of traveling with the band but the filmmakers seem to forget that what we want to watch over and over is not the interviews and sound bites and jump-cuts to band members getting on tour buses or hanging out in hotel rooms(unless its a band that is doing something that we want to see like say the Stones in '72 ) but these guys when offstage just seem like ordinary guys who are not really interested in tearing it up. The music itself is what counts, the musicians say so themselves, and thats what we want too, the music. Lets face it Winwood is a genius onstage (so long as he's surrounded by great players that allow him to jam) but a dynamic off-stage presence he's not, so he's just not that interesting to follow around. Capaldi, on the other hand, has great camera presence and his character and humor really come across. His mugging for the camera is on occasion pretty funny. But, on several occasions, the filmakers cut-away from musical jams in progress in order to give us more of this stuff and this is sheer madness. When you buy a live album or a live DVD (especially one of a band that is known for its awesome jam potential) the one thing that you do not want is for those jams to be interrupted or edited or interefered with in any way. This music is sacred so light up, enjoy, and leave it alone. Really not cool of the vidoegraphers to cut-away mid-jam ever for any reason!  Note to future concert vidoegraphers: keep camera focused on the band, watching them play is plenty of entertainment. If you want to cut-away occasionally to show crowd shots thats fine so long as its a shot of a dancing girl soaking-up-the-music-and-sun, but no cut-aways that involve cutting songs short (as these filmmakers do in the middle of "Glad"). Also probably would have been best to leave Jerry Garcia out of the "Dear Mr. Fantasy" sequence, Jerry just wasn't feeling the song, so why do we need to watch Jerry not Feelin' all that Alright. I love Jerry but I don't want a video record of this particular moment which was not one of his best.   I am guessing that this DVD was the work of more than one filmmaker because occasionally it does achieve that ground level and grassroots feel that we want from a live performance that we attended and have more than fond memories of.  Of course the people we see at the concert on this video are not the ones we saw when we were there (our own absence from the procedings is maybe why concert videos always seem to be mssing some key ingredient) but it is nice to be reminded that part of the concert experience is what happens before the show, and what happens offstage in the audience during the show while sitting on the grass among strangers who are nonetheless feeling the vibe along with ya.   No better show opener than "Pearly Queen" and no better show closer than the TRAFFIC version (complete with long drum build up) of "Gimme Some Lovin'".....lots of good stuff inbetween as well..."40,000 headmen" & "John Barleycorn".....  At the show I saw I do seem to remember hearing "Empty Pages" and "Dream Gerard" in addition to the rest of the set list on this DVD. So, what's up videographers?  By the way these performances sound virtually identical to the live versions of these songs on WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN and that is not a bad thing since that is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. If you are new to TRAFFIC and don't really want or need a concert DVD but want to experience the live TRAFFIC then WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN is the way to go. CANTEEN has "Pearly Queen" and "Medicated Goo" as well as "40,000 Headmen" and "Dear Mr. Fantasy" and Gimme Some Lovin'" but it also has three Dave Mason songs so you get "Feelin' Alright", "Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave", and "Sad and Deep as You."+dvd
Politically correct retelling ruins the message.+N+Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).  So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!  But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.  The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun+dvd
The party+P+This movie is a must see for all Peter Sellers fans.  Not much dialogue but very, very funny. +dvd
broken .+N+The breakdance trio are back . this time around they're trying to stop the demolition of a community center. And at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly's - Lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone's  - adolfo quinines - feelings towards Kelly and turbo's - Michael chambers - love interest .   If the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and  bad costume design . even ICE T sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents.  But , If you liked the first movie , like me , then you can't resist  buying this sequel. at least you'll see turbo's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly's not that bad acting .  Otherwise avoid .+dvd
One of the better poker DVDs, just a little boring +P+This DVD is pretty good, but the reviews I had read led me to believe I was really going to get an amazing batch of pro secrets. The DVD is good and she does tell some things that you probably haven't heard anywhere else. I am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the FBI and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table. I really thought those two areas were exceptional. It always seems like common sense after you hear it, but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information.   A few downsides to mention: She discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent. I only play online, so this stuff didn't help me. Also, when she discusses a tell, she performs it herself as she talks about it. When Lederer discussed tells in his DVD, he had actors play them out in a scenario, which I thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember. The DVD never leaves a poker table with her just talking--which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times. Had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little, I think it would have been better. Basically, the DVD gets a little boring after watching it a time or two.   Wrapping up this review, you have Annie Duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table. It might not be the most entertaining DVD you ever buy, but there is some good information on the DVD. Definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time. If you only play poker online, you can skip this one and wait for her online poker DVD. It should be a better choice. If you play some live poker, I think you'll definitely want to know the information on this DVD. It could really make you more dangerous at the tables.+dvd
just not really funny+N+If you aren't really into jokes about the difference between black/white, sex, drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you.  I had seen other stuff by Pryor I always liked but this time I never once really laughed out loud. It was dissapointing, good thing he has so many other good stuf+dvd
I hated this movie+N+I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits+dvd
pretty good Fantasey!+P+To tell you the truth i had never read the book before because the libary always has other holds on it but i went ahead and wacthed this movie with my sister and younger brother we were hoping we would enjoy it despit bad reveiws, so it turns out we liked it, my sister said it's seem's more of a remake of lord of the rings (as everyone else does ) the dragon was wonerfully done we liked the fact that it had a mind of it's own. Ed Spellers did better than i thought for a newcomer, i always enjoy Jeremy irons (exepct for the really bad D&D)the only miscast really was John Malvoich as the evil king i just think he didn't fit well, overall a pretty good fantasy not a classic but good enough for me.( it's my 3rd favariet dragon movie besides dragonheart and dragonslayer i highly recommend those)+dvd
Pleasant and Satisfying Film+P+After watching too many critically acclaimed movies which left me at the final credits feeling like petrified wood, I'm now allowing myself to rent and enjoy movies that I formerly shunned because they received poor reviews. Happily, I've progressed through that stage. I've learning that what a professional critic likes and what I like do not always match. I really enjoyed this movie. I admit that some of the satisfaction I got from viewing this movie came from the sight of the young male actor's attractive physique. At least it helped me understand the main character's temptation. I could imagine myself in her place. If only life was fair, I would be. If you're in the mood for light laughs, and a bit of poignancy, rather than the highs and lows of a dramatic roller coaster, this film will not disappoint+dvd
24 Season 1 - 5 Review+P+If you like suspense and action, great plots you should watch this series.  Really well done.  I always have a few DVD's with me - I spend a lot of time waiting in the car while my kids are at practice!  I get boared reading so I watch videos - this one is the best! +dvd

A collection of films you'll find nowhere else for the serious film history buff+P+If I was getting a gift for TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne, and I knew he didn't already have this DVD set I would (a) be very surprised and (b) buy it for him. This DVD set is for film buffs who aren't satisfied with the essentials that everyone knows about - "Birth of a Nation", "The Jazz Singer", "Frankenstein", etc., which are great films, but don't tell the whole story of early cinema. The set was organized by Bruce Posner and runs to some nineteen hours, and is an astonishing achievement. The set consists of seven discs each of which explore a different aspect of early cinema.   Among the films included are Douglass Crockwell's "Simple Destiny Abstractions", plus some animations with some very good detail on the level of Windsor McCay. The 1928 version of "The Fall of the House of Usher" focuses more on displaying some complex optical work than the story, reducing Poe's tale to only ten minutes in length. "Night on Bald Mountain" is an example of pinboard animation, in which a film is made completely using shadows from a pin screen. This technique continued to be used for decades. Suspense - a 1913 melodrama in which a housewife and her baby are nearly attacked by a knife-wielding drifter - is included because of its split-screen techniques. However, it is also interesting as the beginnings of what became the psycho-thrillers that exist to this day.  For the budget conscious, the disc entitled "PICTURING A METROPOLIS, New York City Unveiled" is the only disc available for individual purchase. This particular disc is great for history buffs as well as film buffs for all of its views of New York City life during the period from 1890-1940. The New York City disc moves from early footage of the city, including the Edison Company's famous and poetic Coney Island at Night, to Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's well-known Manhattan, to some work by Rudy Burckhardt, the film-maker, photographer, and painter who was also one of de Kooning's earliest friends in New York.  There are also some films financed by the depression-era WPA. Among them, Elia Kazan makes an appearance in a rather odd socialist movie about the poor of New York. There are some pictures sponsored by Labor Unions that offer 'alternative newsreels' that expose illegal business thuggery and a reactionary murder cult known as The Black Legion. Entertainment figures that are later blacklisted for their political beliefs and actions also make an appearance here - most notably, Paul Robeson, an actor often forgotten because of this. Robeson can be seen narrating a film on organized labor in this collection.  The disc entitled "The Beginnings of Ciné-Dance" has quite a bit of variety, but is still clearly delimited, opening with Annabelle Moore's "Butterfly Dance" and offering near its end David Bradley's Peer Gynt of 1941, starring a teenage Charlton Heston.  Some of the best material on the set is from Hollywood, probably due to the larger budgets involved. Included in this category would be some of the original montages of Slavko Vorkapich that were done for some MGM movies. This includes a bit of film in which the entire Napoleanic war appears to play out in just two minutes. Also included is Vorkapich's opening montage to "Crime Without Passion" in which three banshees fly about and terrorize the streets of Manhattan. The Ernst Lubitsch "touch" also apparently includes montages, and there is an excerpt from 1926's "So This is Paris" that shows a flapper dance in montage. It does a good job of conveying the wildness of the place at that time, which is part of the central theme of the movie. Also included are Busby Berkeley's numbers "Lullaby of Broadway" and "By a Waterfall", which are light compared to the other pieces with their more hidden deeper meanings.   I could go on forever describing the contents of this DVD set, but these were the pieces that stood out the most to me, anyway. The label of "Avant Garde" does not really fit this collection as we know the meaning of the term today. After all, there is work here by the Edison Company, D.W. Griffith, and a host of other people who have secure places in mainstream motion picture history. The "Avant Garde" label is more of an indication that film as an artform during the time period covered was inherently avant-garde just because it was new. The quality of the video is quite good considering the probable shape of the originals. I personally love this set and think it is well worth the price+dvd
Ace of Spies, King of Hearts+P+Sidney Reilly really was an international man of mystery and no-one really knew him including his wives and fellow spies.  Sam Neil was incredible as Reilly. He showed a man who was elegant, charming and yet so ruthless you could almost see the ice in his veins. He doesn't have a problem with killing and he doesn't have a problem with leaving an incompetent agent behind either. He was a womanizer who could be the ultimate romantic in one scene then simply walk away in the next. One of the most touching scenes in the series is when Reilly's wives and sweethearts all clamor for news of him. He's treated some of these women horribly. One he's turned into a hopeless drunk but they still can't get enough of him. In another scene, one of his conquests calmly faces death rather than betray him. After her death Reilly, the series implies, carries her earrings, the only thing he has left of her on him for the rest of his life.  Reilly has been called the grandfather of the Jame Bond character because by the time young Ian Flemming came along Reilly was a legend in the British spy world. Flemming denied this but Reilly's relationship with his spymaster is very reminiscent of Bond and M and of course there all those women.   Everything about this series is great. The acting is all top notch, the costumes are perfect, the music, especially Romance of the Gadfly, Reilly's theme is unforgettable. This series came on TV when I was a kid and I would rush home every week to get all my homework and any other chore done so I could watch Reilly in peace. It was worth the trouble then and it's worth it now+dvd
Not exactly the "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".+N+After seeing the overhyped "American Gothic", I must say that I came away disappointed.  What you have here is a movie that was constructed in the mold of the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" where you have some unsuspecting people coming up on a crazed homicidal family.  Unfortunately, the family really comes off looking goofy and silly more than dangerous and deadly.  I would certainly rather come upon Ma and Pa's family than Leatherface and his family if you know what I mean.  "American Gothic" does a decent job of painting a crazy family portrait for sure, but Ma, Pa and company just do not exactly strike fear in the viewer's heart...they just are not that formidable as far as their prowess as horror movie villains.  The kills are not too bad, but certainly are not anything to write home about.  The acting is okay and production values are not too bad for a movie of this nature.  I just did not like the way that Ma and Pa's family came across to the viewer...they come across more weird than horrifying, more eccentric than anything else and not exactly dangerous.  Don't get me wrong...obviously, they killed some people, but I was not convinced in the manner in which this was done or in the family's disposition as brutal killers.  Also, I felt that the ending was rather weak and very predictable.  I guess they just do not make them like they used to anymore.  In short, the way I look at "American Gothic" is that if the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a FIVE STARS horror movie, then this movie, comparatively speaking, is certainly worth no more than ONE STAR...it is what it is folks!  +dvd
An Excellent movie+P+Passion's way movie is based on the Novel "The Reef" by Edith Wharton. The American novelist Edith Wharton spent most of her professional life in Europe. "The Reef" exemplifies her close observation of Americans in France, their inner lives and social conflicts.  On his way to France to see his beloved, the widowed Anna Leath (outstanding perfomance by the always beautiful and talented Sela Ward), Charles Darrow (Timothy Dalton-former James Bond) receives a telegram telling him not to come due to an "unexpected obstacle." As time passes and he doesn't receive an explanation for the delay, he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation.   As he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to London or to press forward, he encounters Sophy Viner, a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended. She is on her way to Paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career. Darrow, who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer, finds himself manipulating Sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison. He is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty.  Four months later, Anna Leath eagerly anticipates Darrow's arrival. During the walk they had in the garden, Anna expresses her love for Charles.  Anna: "I'm not a naive young girl. I know...of course I KNOW...but there are things a woman feels...when what she knows doesn't make any difference. It's not that I want you to explain--I mean about that particular evening. It's only that I want you to know the whole of my feeling. I didn't know what it was till I saw you again. I never dreamed I should say such things to you!"   Charles: "I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!but now that you have said it.... the only thing that matters is that we are here together and I want you to be my wife."  Anna is also excited because her stepson, Owen Leath, wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic, old-fashioned grandmother; he wants to marry Anna's daughter's governess, who is none other than Sophy Viner.  Darrow and Sophy's secret is safe with one another, yet Darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant Anna wants him to support Owen's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities. He tries to convince Sophy that Owen is not right for her. "You'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours," she says "not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact." She is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions.  This is a outsanding movie for people who appreciate understanding the complex nature of human behavior. The movie finishes with these lines:  "What I meant was that when you've lived a little longer you'll see what complex blunderers we all are: how we're struck blind sometimes, and mad sometimes--and then, when our sight and our senses come back, how we have to set to work, and build up, little by little, bit by bit, the precious things we'd smashed to atoms without knowing it. Life's just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits."   Overall this movie is a truly outstanding movie with excellent performances.   +dvd
EXCELLENT!  Very uplifting, 5 star performances, Top Music+P+Neil Diamond is BRILLIANT in this performance, and moreso with the musical score.  Excellent, excellent show, you'll want to watch again and agai+dvd
The decade of the women on the top!+P+The social convulsion of the seventies affected all the layers of the family; many men simply gave up and many women had to face the life with major realism and mercurial energy. The pivot in this sense might be found in the legendary cult movie of John Cassavetes: "A woman under the influence", but the raising of such talented actresses on stage such as Jane Fonda, Glenda Jackson, Catherine Deneuve, Rommy Schneider, Hanna Schygulla, Liv Ullman, Julie Christie, Vanessa Redgrave, Sally Field, Jill Clayburgh, Diane Keaton, or Ellen Burstyn were far to be a mere casualty; they responded to a vision of a world in crisis at different levels, emotional, affective and existential.         Jill Clayburgh (one of my everlasting favorite American actresses) will undertake the exigent task of facing her own life after his husband walks out on her.  One of the top American movies of the Seventies!  +dvd
Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere+N+Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.  This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.  Blecch+dvd
FABULOUS!!!+P+Is there a better Hollywood musical? I don't think so! Julie Andrews is phenomenal!+dvd
Absence of Romance+P+Not a remake of the 1947 detective film with the same title, this one stars Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts as two competing Chicago newspaper reporters who meet while investigating a mysterious train crash.  They eventually untangle a conspiracy involving corrupt scientists and cancer causing goat milk. The film is intended as an homage to Howard Hawks' comedies like "His Girl Friday" and "Bringing up Baby," but due to the seriousness of the crime and lack of chemistry between the two leads, midway through starts feeling more like "Silkwood."    Husband and wife team Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers previously milked the forties screwball comedy formula with "Father of the Bride," but there are too many unsettling red herrings and not enough real love to make this one worth struggling through+dvd
Not for the half-hearted Eurythmics follower like me...+N+I must admit that virtually as soon as I bought this DVD (out of curiousity because many other reviewers are in the &quot;gotta see them live&quot; camp) I wondered if I'd done the right thing;  when I played it I SO much wanted to justify my purchase but alas cannot;   there is energy, yes, but little variety - all musicians apart from Dave S are subordinate &amp; the performances, to me, are formulaic;  I almost cut it off after the first 6 tracks but skipped forward to &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; &amp; &quot;There must be an Angel&quot; &amp;, thankfully found some comfort in the familiarity of these &amp; the (few) songs which followed.  Bottom line:  fine for true fans but not for the half-hearted+dvd
Don't waste your time or money!+N+This movie doesn't even deserve a *star*. Lousy movie.......instead of Lost Junction, it should be called LOST TIME+dvd
The Men who Fought for the Honor of Saving America's Worst Actor+N+After its disturbing and frighteningly chaotic opening sequence, this film swiftly degenerates into another typically stupid, arrogant AMERICAN war film.  Spielberg is a great director, and deserved praise for the opening sequence alone, but what could he do with a screenplay that is little more than a boring melodrama with stereotypical characters who all die in increasingly gruesome ways.  Without the massive buckets of blood, why would we want to watch?  This film is NOT reality, and the fact that it pretends to be reality is offensive to me.  Hollywood's God-complex is its undoing.  Okay lets all pat ourselves on the back one last time for being "brave" enough to revel in the glorious bloody pulp of war.  In my opinion, this film is like a horror film with a bad plot.  Imagine having to fight, bleed, and die all kinds of horrific ways for the honor of saving Matt freakin' Damon.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go watch the ending of The Departed again.  There's a movie with an ending that will leave you smiling+dvd
A rip off of Scarface and the Godfather+N+This movie is a clear rip off of Scarface and The Godfather. In fact the story is essentially exactly the same as The Godfather with the Scarface coke empire thrown in. The only difference is that there is the cops view of the events that go down and of course the fact that all of the main characters save one are black. Despite the fact that this movie is a blatant rip off I did enjoy it mainly because of Wesley Snipes acting. Other than that its been done before and been done much better+dvd
I found it...tiresome....+N+My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French.  In English, its unbearable.  Slow?  At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes+dvd
Charming and Fun+P+My 3-year-old daughter loves Max & Ruby. The somewhat patient big sister, Ruby, spends her time with friends and Bunny Scouts, while her little brother, Max, spends HIS time finding ways to cause mischief. Based on books by Rosemary Wells, these short stories are fun, sweet, and gentle viewing for small children.  The DVDs have an auto-play function, which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child. The show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than 30 seconds or so. When the episodes are all played out, it goes back to the menu and restarts.  While TV/DVDs should not be used as alternatives to good parenting, the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home.   I HIGHLY recommend "Max & Ruby" of any title. They are all wonderful. [My husband even gets a kick out of Max's antics.]  -C.W+dvd
Seinfeld will always be the best comedy that was (and still is) on TV.+P+If you've never watched Seinfeld, and are definately from Earth, then you have to start watching it now. If you've seen it, as practically everyone who likes comedy has, then you know that season six and seven are two of the best seasons that they made. You definately want to own the set for years to come! When you are sitting there after a hard day and you need to cheer up, what better than Seinfeld to do the job and leave you with a good feeling+dvd
Sleazy and trashy+N+Reason To Believe has got to be the worst movie I have ever sat through. Non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting. I am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay. There really is no reason to see this movie. Totally disgusting. Why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension!!!+dvd
Super fast delivery!+P+Great seller & the DVD came in perfect condition.  Thank you+dvd
If You Enjoyed "Ju-On: The Grudge" . . .+P+. . . then this film may be for you!  Like "Ju-On: The Grudge," "Ju-On 2" presents a series of interconnected vignettes. Though the non-linear presentation can sometimes confuse the viewer, it takes only a moment to realize the correlation between the last portrait and the next. So, be patient;)  This film has a bit of a postmodern spin (which many horror-film scholars may enjoy).  One of the main characters, Kyoko Harase, plays an actress known as "The Queen of Horror." She is taken to the infamous Saeki home to give a television interview about her own experience as a horror actress. It is there that she is marked with the curse (in a fairly unpredictable way!!) And, there that true horror enters her own life.  To the joy of many viewers, Toshio figures prominently into "Ju-On 2." Though the make-up on Toshio is a little flat (unlike "Ju-On The Grudge") his acting is still pitch-perfect. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that Yuya Ozeki (who play Toshio Saeki) did not understand the part he was playing in earlier films (simply as a result of his tender age). He has now refused to watch his own films and his parents go to the premieres alone:) (You can discover this information on the American version of "The Grudge" in Takashi Shimizu's commentary).    Some reviewers seem hyper-critical of this work. Yes, the film has some missteps, but they are easily overlooked. If you watched and enjoyed "Ju-On: The Grudge" then try "Ju-on 2" . . . you might be pleasantly surprised!  +dvd
crackling humor and sad ending makes a great film+P+after seeing brokeback mountain, i decided to see more of ang lee's films and came upon this gem that perfectly shows the same type of sad melencholy used in brokeback. the film takes place in the 1970's and centers around two family's the hoods (consisting of kline, allen, ricci, and mcguire) and the carvers (consisting of weaver, wood, and that one kid) who go through many events that boil together one night during an ice storm.  the husband of the hoods is having an affair with weavers character, the kids are exploring sex and drugs, and allens character goes from shop-lifting to cheating on her husband too. the film plays out in two parts, the first hour or so is mainly a comedy while the last hour plays like a drama that leads to a very sad ending. truly a great ang lee film, must check it out if you loved brokeback+dvd
Totally Underrated!!+P+This is a fabulous &quot;feel good&quot; movie.  I've watched it a dozen times and it's still a favorite to pop in the VCR when company comes calling.  This movie never got the publicity it deserved so it's pretty much a surprise when I play it for guests.  Then, everyone wants a copy.  I probably would never have heard of it myself if my mom hadn't been an extra in it.  It was filmed in Winchester Bay, Oregon where my mom had a gift shop+dvd
The weakest season?  I think not!+P+Season 7 has this stigma attached to it that it is the weakest season out of all the seasons of Friends.  I have no idea what these people are talking about.  Yes, some episodes were better than others and some plotlines were tedious, but I still thought this was a great season.  The main theme of this season is the planning of Monica and Chandler's wedding, but there are many storylines scattered throughout, such as Rachel's romance with her assistant, Joey returning to Days of Our Lives, the brief return of Phoebe's scientist boyfriend, and Ross learning to play bagpipes.  This season will have you in stitches!  Here's a list of my favorite episodes from this season:  The One With Phoebe's Cookies The One With Rachel's Assistant The One With the Nap Partners The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs The One With All the Candy The One With the Holiday Armadillo The One Where Rosita Dies The One Where They All Turn Thirty The One With Joey's New Brain The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin The One With the Vows The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding  Next is the season where Rachel is pregnant!  Can't wait!   +dvd
eastwood great as always, everything else.....eh+N+Being a big Eastwood fan, I bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night.  Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles.  Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always.  This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous.  After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband?  I mean, no one says a word to him.  And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing?  Are you kidding?  I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break.  This ain't no academy-award winner.  Eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey+dvd
calling this the worst horror movie is kind+N+this is movie is A NICE BIG PILE OF WARM DOO DOO.THERE NOTHING ENTERTAINING ABOUT THIS FILM HORRIBLE ACTING AND SERIOUS OVER ACTING ARE JUST THE BEGINNING TO THIS MESS.NO STORY TO BE FOUND SUPER BAD SPECIAL FX .I MEAN U CAN SEE RAW MEAT TOSS ABOUT AND THE NEW GUINEA ZOMBIES LOOK LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS U FIND IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA.AND ADDING STOCK FOOTAGE IS PLAN LAZY.I DON'T KNOW IF THE PERSON WHO DIRECTED THIS STILL ALIVE IF HE IS HE SHOULD BE MADE TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S MAKING FRIES FOR LIF+dvd
0 STARS:  Not a horror movie, therefore not my thing.+N+"Chopping Mall" is styled like an 80s slasher, but is in fact, not a horror movie.  In actuality, what you get with this movie is more science fiction/action with some cheesey comedy as well.  Simply put, "Chopping Mall" doesn't work as a horror movie because the killers are machines and therefore the element of evil is completely lacking which is not conduicive to a pure horror movie.  In fact, one could argue that this movie is more or less like "Maximum Overdrive" or maybe even "Runaway" (in a sense), only not as good because those movies, while technically implausible, actually made some sense theoretically speaking, unlike this most unfortunate piece of rubbish known as "Chopping Mall".  I do not recommend "Chopping Mall" if you are looking for a horror movie or an 80s slasher flick as the movie is in all fairness a dark yet "total farce".  Instead, I would recommend "He Knows You're Alone" as probably the best of the relatively unknown 80s slasher/horror movies+dvd
Poor video quality+N+I purchased this product to benefit from dvd technology.  The reviews on the website led me to believe that this product was somehow updated, or upgraded for use with dvd technology.  Last winter, I ordered the video, which is is like a pirated version, with very low resolution.  If I could, I would return the two dvds I purchased.  I feel ripped off and stuck with an inferior product.  I love callanetics content.  Amazon should be urging this company to provide new material.  It's no help to see a sticker on the dvd I purchased announcing new products in Dec. 2006, which is when I purchased two inferior Callanetics dvds+dvd
Dutch Colonial never looked so bad+N+I've never heard of the "Bell Witch" before, and this movie didn't really get me interested enough to care.  Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek must have needed a payday real bad to appear in this clunker: parts of it are so unintentionally funny that they should cut and spliced into the next "Scary Movie" they make.  The director, I guess, didn't realize that a lot of people have seen that movie "The Exorcist".  (Remember?  With Linda Blair?  Oh yeah!) The scene that was bust-a-gut-laugh-till-you-vomit was when the girl is picked up by her hair--you can actually see a wire or something for a minute--and dangled in the air.  It looked so unbelievably fake that I began to see this more as a comedy than anything else.  Is the entity so mad that it wants to glue the hair of young girls together (maybe a deleted scene has her waking up covered in spitballs).  The ending, however, and what is implied about Sutherland's character is not one bit funny and struck me as unnecessarily morbid; also, the performances and general plotline before can't support an issue as serious as incest or child abuse.  I guess at some point this was so obviously a clunker to everyone in the crew that the decision was made to throw something really sick into the plotline.  It didn't save the movie.  The only creepy scene is the ending.   +dvd
Addictive viewing. Brilliant presentation+P+We came to the West Wing late and from a country outside the USA. We have found it compelling viewing with some episodes that used all aspects of cinema so well they went far beyond the usual TV fare. Watching them all back to back from this box set you can have some quibbles such as unueven character development at times (people do things very much 'out of character' occasionally) and everyone has the same sense of humour (which I've never found in a workplace). But I think these things were more noticeable watching them all at once. In a long series such as this the writers could be forgiven for drifting and forgetting from time to time. The acting is almost uniformly excellent. I'd like to particularly applaud the packaging of this box set. Its a compact way of presenting 45 disks and is very appropriate to the series -a blue leather folio with files for each season inside.It also has several lavish accompanying booklets. Clever and appropriate marketing. The price was fine too - reasonable 'per season' cost as sold by Amazon+dvd
good cinamatography+N+The movie was well filmed.  The plot and dialogue while possibly accurate was dull and boring.  One of the worst war movies I have seen.  I own it but not for long+dvd
Liked the better the 2nd and 3rd time I watched it.+P+I have to admit that my expectations were high for this movie and I was initially disappointed.  The plot was unrealistic and the ending far-fetched.  Since I had bought it, I watched it again and found that it was one of those movies that needs to be watched more than once because the enertainment is in the one liners and very funny scenes.   Watch it again.  It is hilarious.  -gooosfrab+dvd
Fun to Watch!+P+Lighten up, fellow reviewers!  ANGER MANAGEMENT is lighthearted comedy--not neurosurgery.  I had zero expectations going into this movie, but as soon as the hilarious plane scene unfolded I found myself watching with an ear-to-ear grin on my mug.  I've seen Adam Sandler in numerous movies (and hated most of them), but as humble, wishy-washy Dave Buznik, Sandler is at his low-key best.  Buznik is the last person to have an anger management problem, but following a fateful series of miscues (and hysterically funny miscues at that) he is ordered by a judge to attend an anger management course.  And this is not just any old course:  This is a course led by the unorthodox and dysfunctional Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson's inherent creepiness is perfect for this role).  Nicholson and Sandler play off one another in grand fashion; the goofy therapist pushing the mild-mannered Buznik to the edge--and beyond--is mucho fun to watch!  An added delight to this campy comedy is the plethora of camoes, including John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson (also hysterically funny), Rudy Giuliani, and New York Yankee greats (and ex-greats) Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.  ANGER MANAGEMENT is pure fun, complete with milquetoast ending and wacky Nicholson facial expressions.  Enjoy! --D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING +dvd
Thompson the terrible+N+Why do I dislike Emma Thompson so much as an actress? Aha, I know why -- she can't act. She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal+dvd
Blah...+N+I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me+dvd
Just isn't very good+N+I'm a big fan of Joe Dante and I love Martin Short, but 'Innerspace' is just too high on concept and low on just about everything else. You know the tendency for even many great comedies to somehow "require" a villian sub-plot? Well 'Innerspace' not only falls victim to that, but the "on the chase from the bad guy" scenario propels the film. I guess you could call it "adventure", but there's nothing interesting or exciting about it. Short does what he can here and there, but most of it feels like made-for-TV filler material... honestly.   I don't know... Dante is a creative genius, but this is his most lacking IMO. Sure, this is one flick that has brilliant special effects and doesn't ever overplay them, but you almost wish they'd had, because at least something interesting would be happening. 'Gremlins' and 'The 'burbs' had awesomely unique concepts but, by and large, maintained a degree of freshness around them for their running time; 'Innerspace' can't survive for any real length of time.   The concept of the film is great, no doubt, and the actual execution of the fundamental mental/physical relationship between Short and Quaid is pulled off with valor... which is strange, because it's the superficial aspects of the film that fall on their face. I guess that makes sense; Dante is an imaginative nut, and in the face of a drab script and story, he doesn't know what to do+dvd
buy this DVD/CD it is worth it+P+This DVD/CD combo is a very worthy effort by Coheed and Cambria. It includes all of their hit songs and they are a joy to watch live. The only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the DVD is sub-par. This doesnt mean that it is bad, it just isnt the kind of quality I would expect from a big time band like Coheed and Cambria. Even though the audio isnt that great, I still watch the thing all the time. The best part of this package is the CD that comes along with it. This is worth buying this product alone. I suggest putting the CD on full blast and watching the DVD on mute. All in all I give the DVD 3 out of 5 and the CD 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4. This should hold anyone that needs a Coheed fix until they put out their next C+dvd
Ok for British sex ed vid on AIDS, other than that....+N+I found this video to be a real snoozer. While the title "My first time" suggests a sexy look at guy's first experiences, nothing could be farther from the truth.  This video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases.  While it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid, if I knew that sex ed is what this video preached about (i.e. how to use a condom), I would have passed.  This video is produced in England, and for an American, the accents can be distracting.  My recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex, get this video.  If you know the ropes, pass on this one+dvd
Excellent DVD transfer.+P+I was comparing this season with similar DVD's that were in the same years, even much later, and I must say these DVD transfers are top notch. Hard to believe this show is 40 years old. The color and sound came out great. No one should be complaining about the quality of the transfers, A+dvd
Pointless+N+The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring.  The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing.  The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other.  Not my idea of a good time+dvd
pathetic+N+terrible! dialog non existent. Need to run this with subtitle on to  make a feeble attempt to hear the actors+dvd
BOGUS....+N+It says 1-6 pack. but I only had 1 to 5 seasons (DVD's) in it. do not ever buy from this selle+dvd
I Liked It......+P+Nothing new but well done.  An angry spirit torments a group of friends then causes their deaths one by one.  I really enjoyed the ending in this movie. +dvd
Interesting Collection+P+This is an interesting, odd little collection for Karloff fans.  I don't think you'll be disappointed although the "Boogie Man..." is a little odd+dvd
Eyes like olives...+P+This film is either the stupidest movie ever made or one of the best.  I laughed for the first 30 minutes, virtually without stopping.  The rest of the film is also very good, I was just tired.    The concept of taking an old cliched film and morphing it into a spoof of the entire genre is brilliant and very well executed here.  Hope that they release a sequel.+dvd
Simply put: Not Funny+N+While surfing the channels one night, I happen to stumble upon Mind of Mencia. I attempted to get into the show, and actually watched a few episodes, but barely got more then a slight chuckle. I usually love Comedy Central, but this effort by Ned "Carlos Mencia" Holness simply isn't funny.  I'm not going to go into detail about how he's really Honduran/German and not Mexican, or that he's been accused by several other comedians of stealing material, I'll simply comment on what I saw. And what I saw simply lacked comedic value.  He's often compared to Dave Chappelle, but Dave Chappelle's racial remarks are made in a very smart, interesting, and often unique manner, and Chappelle show didn't need to be racist to be funny (like the Rick James skit)  Mind of Mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into: White people do _________, while Mexicans do _________.  Its just not funny+dvd
Hollow. Terrible.  One Good Line Quoted Here.+N+The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.   The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with love."   This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.   Well-made period romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book. +dvd

SUPERB LOOK AT THE EMPTINESS AND MADNESS OF STOLEN LOVE+P+Written by playwright Noel Coward, directed by David Lean, starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, and set to the impassioned music of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2, this is a story about two people living quietly dull lives, married to equally dull spouses, who suddenly find someone interesting to share a brief encounter with. This masterful film shows how hungry normal, ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting, and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with. The normal avenue for such a relationship would have been their own spouses; but they are unable to find it there, somehow. So they find it one day, accidentally, illicitly, secretly, dishonestly, soul wrenchingly in a stranger. Now these quietly dull souls become quietly desperate souls, as they realize that stolen love comes with a price, and that what had promised to bring them boundless happiness is instead bringing them more sorrow than they have ever known before.  I found many parallels in this movie with other quietly desperate people that I know: friends of mine who have tried to find happiness illicitly, secretly, dishonestly in work, sex, alcohol, drugs, co-dependent relationships, etc. I think this movie has a powerful message for our times. It is not about a love relationship that was doomed because of a stricter social and moral code than we have today; it is about the emptiness and madness of stolen love of any kind. I love the way the film ends, with repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation. This film is a timeless gem.  Waitsel Smit+dvd
More Fun than a Barrel of Crack Babies+N+Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.  The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This "problem" became an asset later.  The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.  It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.  In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.  Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.  If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this+dvd
One of the best in one of the worst eras of Doctor Who+P+Mark of the Rani stands out in the Colin Baker Doctor Whos.  It's direction, music, writing and acting are all superior to most of what we saw in the sixth Doctor's sadly short reign.  Colin Baker actually behaves like the Doctor in this one.  For instance, rather than strangle Peri, he is above all concerned with her welfare.    Add the Bickersons, also known as the Rani and the Master, and you've got a rollicking adventure with strong science fiction as its base.  Pay close attention to the dialogue and you'll see another hint from the Master, in his very precise insult, that the Doctor's half-human.    Extras are numerous informative and inventive.  The DVD transfer is astounding.  The audio quality is meliflous.+dvd
Jungle Book 2 Did not Have To Be made Limited Issue Is 100 Times Better+N+Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time.

This Sequel Is Not So Bad. It Is Only Unnecessary.+N+What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?  To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.  But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.  But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.   After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.  To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel+dvd
IT ISN'T TEXAS!!!+P+This is probably my most favorite movie ever, but I would like to point out to all the people, including the official amazon.com review, that IT ISN'T TEXAS! The movie was filmed in Kern County- specifically Bakersfield, California. Nowhere in the movie does it imply that it is Texas, and in fact locals will recognize many landmarks from the 70's, including I think it is 19th Street with the Hub (where we all bought western clothing and boots), the pawn shops, and the porn shops. The turn-off where Bobby gets caught up playing a piano on the back of the pick-up truck is to Shafter, CA, one of the small dust-bowl era farm towns in Kern County. The bowling alley was Freddy's Top of the Hill on Union Avenue, where we all went bowling in high school. Bobby works not in the Texas oilfields, but in the oilfields, now for the most part non-producing (although the oil supposedly is still there, just being held for economic reasons), that are located out near Taft. Now that that is cleared up- the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion Nicholsons' best and most raw acting, without the goofy cliche crazy Nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work. His scene with his father before he leaves is pure, open, painful emotion- and one of the best performances on-screen of any actor, ever+dvd
This movie is by far the worst but...+N+If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after  scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring+dvd
I really like this one ;-)+P+To be honest, The Firm isn't one of my favourite series.  Often, there are instructors not giving clear cuing and they can be out of time.  For some reason, I decided to give this a go and I'm glad I did because it's one of the better workouts of theirs. There is lots of variations in movements and music so it's kept fresh and interesting.  For once I found the cuing very very precise and right on time.  The instructor, Alison Davis, not only cues well to let you know what's coming up, but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique.  The mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and I've found results already.  It's a little over 50 minutes all up, and all you need is two sets of dumbbells.  It's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level.  It's fun and I like to do this once or twice a week along with my other routines and dvds.  I thoroughly recommend this+dvd
I think some reviewers are missing the point+P+I understand that the Holocaust is a sensitive subject to people of all ages, races, religions, gender, and so on. It is important that the world understands how and why this happened, and i commend all people who make an effort to recast and teach the world the terror that so many were subjected to. Yes, we all know Robin Williams to be the slapstick comedian which has brought tears of laughter to our eyes instead of ones of compassion. But like  Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful, Williams brings to life a character who tries to lift the spirits of friends and strangers who are looking for one thing, hope. Whether Williams' character was real or imaginary, the human spirit can never be completely wiped by tyranny and oppression. 10 million people, including 6 million Jews were systematically killed before the Nazi's were finally stopped. Some died as fighters, some gave their lives for others, and some gave just simple acts of kindness, good will, and love. Each one of them were heroes of their own kind.  William's character told lies about Russian troop advancement to give the Jews of his Ghetto the will to survive and resist. Like real life heroes such as Rauol Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler, Mordecai Anielewicz, Hannah Senesh, and thousands of others who risked their lives for others, this is a story of a good man.  Maybe this movie was not an exact interpretation of its predecessors, books or movies, and yes it did have some hollywood-like moments. But oeverall, a tribute to the men, women, and children who shall always be remembered and never forgotten+dvd
Great film performed  by a great cast.+P+This first scene of this film caught my attention immediately, it was sort of telling me "Sit tight and pay attention Jenny." "Sólo mía' is another film about gender violence in the family. It adopts a totally different attitude to the subject matter when compared with Icíar Bollaín's film which is at once more subtle in its telling.  `Sólo mía' shoves the nitty-gritty between your teeth so that you can choke on it: some of the scenes are too explicit, one might argue, and are numerously frequent; in `Te doy Mis Ojos' the hard subject matter is more carefully handled.  However, Paz Vega, who starred in `Lucía y el Sexo' (qv) the same year, put in a recommendable performance as the badly beaten and tortured young mother; Sergi López as her husband plays his part well, though at times seemed to over forcefully portray his performance, thus almost beggaring belief. It should be said that his role was very tricky, to say the least. I feel that Luis Tosar carried off his performance in `Te doy Mis Ojos' more convincingly, with better balancing between the extremes of tensions and feelings.  The rest of the cast form a good back-up to the leading couple.  This film also points an accusing finger at the legal system, in which hypocritical legalities and aloofness does little - or nothing - to help solve this horrifying situation so evident today in so many headlines in Spain today. Something has got to be done: more than 70 women were killed in `gender violence' in Spain in 2003. At the end it's a great film, I truly admire European cinema that doesn't sugar coat their films. Highly recommended.+dvd
Pilates for 50+ with Amy Brown+P+This is one of many pilates dvds I've watched.  The 20 minute one for beginners (the only one I use) is quite good.  Amy repeats important directions repeatedly and gives gentle reminder not to strain lower back or neck and to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.  This beginner set has been a very good starting point for me and she's right, I can feel my core getting stronger.  The 20 minutes go fast and  you learn what your body can do and build from there.  I would have liked a better view of the second person, the one I was following when Amy suggeted an easier version of the exercise, but you won't go wrong buying it+dvd
I Haven't seen it yet+P+I haven't seen this movie, but i am very happy that finally another Hal Hartley film hsd come on DVD, i just ordered it today, and i sure hope that later other Hal Hartley films come out on DVD, i will later send a letter to Sony Pictures to realese it+dvd
Too much+N+After watching this film I decided to be scientific and use the process of elimination to determine how someone might have been able to appreciate it since I hadn't.  Aesthetics is, after all, a subjective experience, so a little objective rigor brought to bear on enjoyable experiences others might have had watching this movie should theoretically enable me to expand my own repertoire of aesthetic responses.   The first way one could not have found enjoyment watching this film is by being seduced by the exotic locales.  Yes, there was a pan that lasted for about a minute of a pretty Czech village, but otherwise the Newtonian law of cinematics has once again been confirmed, and here's the proof:  In the Bollywood movie, Humtum, a scene that was meant to occur in Paris was filmed on the Museumplein in Amsterdam; so the equal and opposite gaffe was bound to be committed somewhere.  In Hostel, scenes meant to occur in Amsterdam have been filmed (jarringly) in Prague.  And just like they did with the Americans in Borat, I can imagine (in the cynical frame of mind this movie put me in) the filmmakers telling European colleagues and extras, "Don't worry, it doesn't matter - we'll never show this in your country." Well, it eventually mattered to the fratboy who wanted to bring slavery back, and it should have mattered to the filmmakers. QED.  After also eliminating direction, script, and acting as potential means for appreciating this movie I started to worry.  Yes, much thought had obviously gone into making this thing; but the Dusk-To-Dawn pleasure/pain structure and obscure references didn't mesh well with the low-budget sinister spin on European Vacation.  Worse, the unfortunate juxtaposition of beautiful naked flesh and extreme torture in this film exerts a pernicious influence on the psyche of the viewer - surely that couldn't have been intended.  And then, like being shot by a diamond bullet right through my forehead, it became clear that I'd completely missed the point.  This is a message film, and I'd been stupid not to pick up on the movie's lofty ambitions.    The next challenge was to decipher the message, and I tell you this is the part that took the most time.  At first I suspected a sort of buried agenda to keep Americans from traveling outside their country.  The lesson seemed so clear that sublimely beautiful European temptresses want our dollars, but they will 1) mock us at every opportunity for not being cool in an effeminate, European way, 2) shield their true intentions by brazenly conspiring against us to our face in their unfamiliar native tongues, 3) have an almost psychic rapport with thuggish male fellow-countrymen who intend to punish us for having both the motive (wanting to have sex with beautiful girls) and opportunity (lots of aforesaid dollars and girls with loose morals) to steal their women, 4) ultimately sell us over to be tortured because they'll do anything for money (those loose morals again), and 5) succeed in their nefarious plan because the rule of law ends at the US border.  But this interpretation sounded paranoid when I played it back, and I suspected the ultra-violence of the movie had once again influenced my state of mind.  What if this do-not-leave-the-US message was really the unintentional result of some other process at work in the filmmakers' master plan?  So I started listening to the commentary track for more insight, but it was really irritating and I couldn't listen to the whole thing.  They've apparently re-coined the expression, `bully', which must be a sort of Teddy Roosevelt macho thing.  Their country's recent actions around the world have made many Americans feel self-conscious and unloved abroad.  It's unrealistic to think all the issues caused by this will be resolved so soon after the trauma.  Americans have a very pronounced sense of national identity, and we should expect some confused, troubled people doing things that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves.  Also; paying women for sex has a long history, and I wouldn't think to question its place in society.  However, like all those things we're taught from childhood are wrong, paying for sex sets off a complex chain reaction of deep, conflicting emotions.  It's not always pretty to see these emotions being worked through, and unintentionally choosing film as the medium to do this was probably a mistake.  Having exhausted all other reasonable avenues, I've come to the scientific conclusion that the only way to appreciate this movie is to share the sensibilities, sensitivities, and neuroses of the filmmakers; and I find these to be distasteful.  This film helps to mark a key boundary of aesthetic territory, and like the man said: "you never know what's enough until you know what's too much."+dvd
The first of the truly great seasons of Seinfeld+P+After two somewhat experimental seasons, Seinfeld really began hitting its stride in this third season. It's really a tribute to the talent that was in front of and behind the cameras on this show that they tweaked the formula for two seasons until near perfect comedy and chemistry was achieved.   In "The Library" we see how the writers make everything come full circle in this show. One of the best one-episode characters in Seinfeld's history, the Library Detective is an hilariously stubborn old fashioned man who confronts Jerry about a missing book from 1971 that was never returned. Jerry goes to see his girlfriend at the time to see if he returned the book, only to find that he had not. Meanwhile, Kramer meets a pretty librarian and George sees his brown toothed underwear pulling gym teacher, who now is a bum living under the steps of the NYC Public Library. The old man hasn't changed much, and he gives George yet another wedgie.  Also, the library book turned out not to be just a red herring, as it turns out the homeless gym teacher has hung onto it all these years.  "The Red Dot" is a hilarious example of how George cannot just leave well enough alone - he always has to push everything to its limits. Elaine gets the long out-of-work George a job at the publishing company for which she works. Everything would be back on track for George, but he just can't resist having sex in the office with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady takes the encounter more seriously than George does, and George is afraid she'll tell his boss of the encounter and get him fired. He decides to give her a gift, a cashmere sweater that has been deeply discounted because of a tiny red dot on it that is supposedly too small to see yet each of its recipients spot it almost immediately, including the cleaning lady. She informs on George, and he is out of work once again.   The season finale, "The Keys", sets up the Emmy winning fourth season. Kramer has been abusing his house priveleges in Jerry's apartment too much, so Jerry revokes his spare key privileges. Realizing that he has broken the "covenant of the keys" gives Kramer the realization he is now free to break out of his routine. Kramer takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor. Jerry gave his spare keys to Elaine, then when he needs them, he goes with George to Elaine's to search for his spare set, since George has Elaine's spare keys. What they find is Elaine's show-biz project, an episode of Murphy Brown that she has written. Elaine finds the two going through her stuff and in turn revokes George's spare key priveleges. Kramer finds adventure as he journeys across the country to LA where he gets a bit part on Murphy Brown playing her secretary. The next season picks up on the gang trying to locate Kramer in California.  I highly recommend this season as the first season of Seinfeld where everything seems to be clicking both storywise and character-wise. It's not a show where you need any background from previous seasons, since, after all, it is "a show about nothing". However, I found it helpful to view the first two seasons first to see how everything came together+dvd
The Show is Great+P+I love this show it's my favorite show on Saturday afternoon but it's sad that they cancelled this show now I have nothing looking forward too on Saturday afternoon only work but that's it. I love Brennan he's the coolest with his Electricity Powers aka as the Elemental. Then there's Emma but she had left the show in Season 3 her Psyonic powers were cool. Then comes Jesse and that new girl I forgot her name haven't seen the show lately. Then there's Shalimar I like her powers but it's not my favorite out of all these peoples. I can't wait for Season 2 and Season 3 to come out in Box Set because buying it seperate cd's costs alot of money+dvd
yawn...........+N+Hi. Actually I didn't buy this movie, I watched it on Nickelodeon. And it's sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. I almost fell asleep just watching it. I can't believe I used to like these dolls. I bought a Mall Maniac Madison doll a few months ago, now I'm thinking about selling it on Ebay. Bratz are much better, and prettier. I mean, have you seen the My Scene Bling Bling dolls? U-G-L-Y. Alot of people say Bratz dress like sluts, but they don't. My Scene dolls are the ones who wear halter tops and mini skirts almost showing their *ss. I haven't watched the Bratz movies, but I'm sure there much better than these. Don't buy this. PLEASE.  Br@tz Girl   P.S.- Sorry to any girls who like My Scene dolls. It's just my opinion. Please don't be mad+dvd

Best Gang-stars+P+The most complete and humane gangster movie ever packaged. Immersed in news reel style contextual storytelling, with plenty of character driven entertainment. It is astounding how many popular songs of the day are in this film. Cagney is superb and the most likeable "gangster" you could imagine. Most of the characters have a story to tell all of their own+dvd
A magnificent performance of Trane's masterpiece+P+Branford Marsalis' new recording of Coltrane's masterpiece, A Love Supreme, is superb on many levels.  If you're a fan of Trane, and even just luke-warm on Branford, I'm confident you'll find this to be a very worthwhile purchase.     Competent but lesser musicians playing ALS would try to channel Trane and the classic quartet.  Not Branford.  He is a mature artist with a fully-realized style.  He sometimes lovingly quotes Trane, or puts his own spin on a Trane riff, but he is clearly his own man on this recording of A Love Supreme.    Jeff Tain Watts understands the essence of Elvin and Elvin's contribution to ALS.  But, like Branford, Tain is his own man here.  He's great as a sideman, and plays a great solo at the end of Resolution.    Joey Calderazzo - an outstanding pianist who has done excellent and original work with many of today's top jazz artists - falls into McCoy mode in his first solo, but then plays like himself in his second one.  Both are great solos, but I think it shows a real maturity and confidence to be yourself rather than emulate the masters when playing their great works.   The bassist, Eric Revis, is very good, but I'm partial to Robert Hurst's performance on Branford's earlier recording of ALS.     It's worth comparing that earlier performance to the new one.  Branford first recorded ALS ten years ago for a CD compilation called "Stolen Moments:  Red, Hot & Blue".  That version is much shorter - only about 25 minutes, compared to the full-length version on the new DVD/CD combo.  On the older version, Branford's quartet went into the studio, didn't rehearse much (they were all fine musicians and all knew ALS), and started the tape rolling.  It is a wonderful performance, and well-worth having in your collection.  But it sounds like they are not trying to record anything original, just to have a fun time playing Trane's music.  (Be warned, though, that most of that CD contains acid jazz & hip hop.)   In contrast, the new recording does have a bit more of Branford's personality and interpretation.  For example, the chord changes in Acknowledgement are clearly different than on Trane's original recording - not so different to be annoying or trite - but different enough to let you know that Branford has something new to say.  Plus, in the 10 years since the earlier recording, Branford has grown from a very good but young musician to a true master in his own right, and this is evident on the new recording.      The sound & picture quality are PHENOMENAL.  I have about a dozen concert DVDs covering various genres.  This is easily the best sounding & looking of them all.  My TV/DVD player is plugged into a mere bookshelf stereo (albeit a good one), and the sound was SUPERB.  Then, I took the DVD over to a friend's house who has Dolby 5.1 home theater sound, and my God, I thought I was in the club with the musicians!   The picture quality matches the sound quality.  I viewed this DVD on a high-definition wide screen TV, and it was really quite thrilling.    The DVD includes a bunch of interviews.  First is a 30-minute interview between Branford and Alice Coltrane.  She talks a lot about Trane, his music, his relentless pursuit of perfection, some reminiscing about when he wrote ALS, and she and Branford have interesting exchanges about the nature of jazz and other topics.  Then there are a bunch of shorter interviews on various aspects of ALS, including some with Michael Brecker.  I think the interviews are insightful and add value to an already great disc.    Finally, there's a brief segment called "Branford Casual" that shows Branford walking around town, working out at the gym, practicing some classical music on the soprano, rehearsing with his quartet, and misc backstage tour footage.  Neat, but not essential.   Amazingly, you get all this for the price of a CD.  And the package includes an audio CD of the concert performance as a bonus!  +dvd
A look into the life of Dale Earnhardt+P+Not being from the South, and only regularly watching Nascar beginning in 1997, my opinions may not quite be as objective or fact vs. fiction as others.   The movie gives us a look into the legendary NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.  Starting with his upbringing in a small mill town by a tough as nails father who dies in his prime, Ralph, who races the dirt tracks.  It was rumored that noone could ever beat Ralph when he raced.  The story gives us an insight into Dales life up to his tragic Death on the track, while along the way showing us all the people who were a part of his life and a part of what made him be who he was.  From his father, to other racers, his wives and kids, and his special friendship with another driver who perished on the track, Neil Bonnet.  It also shows his reaqaintance with his first son, Cary.  Dale is perplexed to learn that Cary also worked in the same mill that his dad and him worked in, making Cary a 3rd generation mill worker.  It also has a great depiction of Dale Jr., how his stubborness as a teenager is met with a wall of eqaulity from his father, and how the two ended up racing together in the end.  Barry Pepper does an excellent job, I feel, of playing the role of the great racer.  The cast was done superbly for this movie and given their limited budget, I have to give ESPN a "2 thumbs up" for their effort in bringing us a great story about a great individual of our time.  I always had the assumption Dale was a bit of a jerk, a grump, well this movie not only proved that wrong but showed me that the whole track can be filled with grumps when it comes to racing for the next dollar or meal.  Dale Waltrip is portrayed as an arrogant instigator to Earnhardt early in his career.  The second to last scene in the movie leaves us breathless as it shows the 4th turn on the final lap of the Daytona 500 that would ultimately be Dale's last race.  The final scene in the movie, outside of the mill, was very fitting, I won't give it away so watch it!   +dvd
Heartwarming and good for an evening in.........+P+For anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they "gave away".....for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way...have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better...or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when "feeling" was what life was all about, this movie should be right up your alley.    It is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times.......and still like it+dvd
Pretty bad cheese+N+The first 5 minutes was OK. After that, this TV-movie started using all the cliches of...a TV-movie. A bad one.  These cliches include: 1. Many references to babies both on and off the plane. 2. Young love as apparently-orphaned young adults ponder their future together. 3. A supposedly very drunk man becoming rowdy and argumentative, yet showing no real signs of being drunk though much was said about the volume of his drinking. 4. An unhappy man dictating some thoughts - then eventually joyfully reconsidering his comments and throwing the tape recorder away. 5. The expanded time frame, where events that would normally take perhaps a couple minutes dragged out for 1/2 hour - in this case the final descent of the plane. 6. Simplistic explanations of some "technical jargon" for the benefit of only the audience. 7. Voice-overs of the thoughts of some of the characters as they are about to land.  There were also some bad lapses of reality. These include: 1. The claim that the airplane had never been test-flown or simulated when out of gas. 2. Having some sports cars whiz by only feet away - on a wet surface no less - from recreational hot-rodders parked on the abandoned runway who are working on cars and milling about.  3. The apparently stupid teen who can't hear his father yelling and waving at him from 30 feet away to get the hell off the runway as the plane is about to land on him. The worst for last...    4. No one even attempts any crash position during the landing. 5. After landing, the pilot and co-pilot sit there for 10 seconds and contemplate the minor amount of smoke coming up through the console. Note there is no actual fire whatsoever... 6. After all the passengers slide down the rear slide, the co-pilot and other crew slide down, and gather right at the bottom of the slide rather than, say, getting off the runway away from the plane. Only the pilot remains on board. He lingers in the doorway, then decides to go back into the nose again. Why? To fight the nonexistent fire. Egads! He is now overcome by smoke. We wait and wait for him to reappear, but gosh, he doesn't. So the crew must climb back up the ladder to rescue him. Finally everyone gets off the plane. Everyone cheers and congratulates the foolhardy pilot.  The End. Except it's not. There is a freeze-frame on each of the characters with a caption telling what happens to them in the future.  I wanted to give it at least 2 stars but in all honesty I can't.    +dvd
DVD mars an otherwise okay film.+N+This looks like a shot-on-video low-budget effort.  A young woman gets involved with a drug dealer/murderer who's sent to prison.  She helped him almost escape, resulting in the death of a cop, so she goes into hiding as a club dancer.  Eight years later, her past comes back to haunt her.  The film is decent enough to merit 3 stars, but I'm deducting one because of the dreadful DVD.    What's so bad about it?  I'm truly annoyed by DVDs that keep viewers as a CAPTIVE AUDIENCE, forcing them to sit through production credits or FBI warnings, unable to fast forward.  It's an insulting time waster for the audience.  But CARLITA'S SECRET takes it to new levels.  The DVD opens with about a minute of production credits and FBI Warnings, followed by a 5 1/2 minute promo short that one is FORCED to watch.  No fast foward allowed, nor does the Menu button work.  Altogether, over 6 minutes of crap that one must sit through before the film.  Then after the film is over, before you can go back to the Menu, you have to sit through the same 5 1/2 promo short YET AGAIN.  Hey Maverick Entertainment, there's a REASON DVD players come with fast forward and Menu buttons.  It's so that WE THE VIEWER can decide what portion of a DVD that we PAID FOR we choose to watch, WHEN we choose to watch it.  Instead, every time I want to watch this film, I have to sit through your promo crap.  Shame on Maverick Entertainment for stealing the viewer's time like this.  If you get this film, you may want to pop it in the DVD player well before you plan to watch the movie.  Pop it in and then get some snacks or whatever so you won't be forced to watch the promo crap.  That should be a choice, not something DVD distributors force down on a captive audiece+dvd
Boring and unfunny+N+I love Leslie Nielsen especially the Naked Gun series but this movie is just awful.  No belly laughs.  No laughs.  Maybe a chuckler here and there but that's it.  Save your money+dvd
A classic movie beautifully restored for sight and sound!+P+I remember the first time I saw this movie.  My mom took me to see it at our  local theatre and it was 1961.  They even had an intermission so you could get more popcorn!!  I just loved the movie and when I was older (was only 10 when I saw movie) read the book as well.  So of course when we saw this beautiful edition on sale at our local electronics store I had to have it!!  It is just amazing what they can do now to "clean up" the sound so the scratches and static on older VHS/DVD formats are gone and it sounds just like it did in the theatre.  I was also extremely impressed with the re-colorization they did to bring back the green in Viven Leigh's eyes -- she really did have the Scarlett O'Hara eyes -- that was lost in the older versions.  The story is uplifting and sad at the same time.  It was a time in the South that is often forgotten.  It is also a story that you can't place in the context of today's world or it would seem silly or racist or violent.  However, Margaret Mitchell, the author of the book it is based on, DID romanticize the South a lot so you do have to take the storyline and so forth with a least a pound of salt!!  For me the most unforgettable performances are of Butterfly McQueen and Clark Gable.  If you've never seen this movie, it is well worth watching just for the visuals and those two performances.  Wonderfully restored+dvd
Joan of Arc+P+I love the movie Jean was a great actor along with Joan and her family... I highly suggest that you watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Also if you watch it screen it for children under 13, as it has a lot of violence with some scary scenes... such as Joan being burned at stake... Also Jean is there... +dvd
Not a Bad First Experience+P+Having moved overseas when my son was 8 months old, I have been pretty oblivious to what Blue's Clues was. Now that he's 18 months, I ordered this DVD to help him learn about shapes and colors. It's not a bad introduction to the world of Blue's Clues. I remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of Barney and I found Blue's Clues much more palatable. As for my son, he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes. It does keep his interest so definitely a winner+dvd
Drivel+N+I don't like to brag, but I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of movies and whether they're good or not.  I wasn't expecting a blockbuster of a movie, or anything, but MY GOODNESS, this movie was awful!  One could ask themselves, "What's wrong with this movie?" But the answer itself is the very broad question, "What isn't?" Ashley Judd plays strong, sexy women very well, but she does NOT convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate. Not only is Judd's character not believable, the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many "places" to plant their seeds is just stupid. There are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this, and I recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film. Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel+dvd
Just a cute, romantic escape!+P+Forget about trying to take this film seriously - just let yourself go and have fun!  It's billed as an Ashley Judd film, and she's great, but truly the whole key hinges on the chemistry between Ashley and Hugh Jackman, who is absolutely adorable in this film!  They are magic together.  The premise is kind of weird and hard to believe, but as I said, just have fun with it!  Greg Kinnear is good, too, but the way, as is Ellen Barkin.  But Hugh makes the film+dvd
first season of voyage to the bottom of the sea+P+This item, volume 2 of the first season had two defective episodes that would not play all the way through.  The rest of them were cool.. black and white, but action filled and fun+dvd
First Season and Still the Best+P+The first season of Seaview was the best and Season 1, Volume 2 has some of the series best episodes.  Mutiny, Doomsday, The Invaders, The Indestructible Man, The Buccaneer, The Human Computer, The Saboteur, Cradle of the Deep, and The Enemies are top-notch.  I've always loved Seaview's incredible monsters and Mutiny's giant jellyfish is a sight to behold.  The threat of nuclear war is realistically portrayed in Doomsday.  I still get shivers up and down my spine when Robert Duvall opens his eyes in The Invaders and when the robot stalks Patterson and Kowalski in The Indestructible Man.  Only Seaview would have an episode about someone bold enough to steal the Mona Lisa.  This story (The Buccaneer) works because the villian is believable (a touch gay by today's standards but that's why the story works) and the relationships between the crew members are emphasized.  In The Human Computer, Seaview is controlled by a computer that's supposed to replace the crew.  Star Trek did a similar story but Seaview's is better because only Crane and an enemy agent are on board and the sight of these 2 men stalking each other on the deserted sub have great impact.  By far the best episode for me is The Enemies.  With it's crazy cold war politics, Crane and Nelson against the bad guys, and that wonderful room where people on one side seem gigantic compared to those on the other side, how could this episode miss.  As always, the special effects, the black and white photography, and Paul Sawtell's wonderful theme make Seaview one old series that's worth visiting over and over again           +dvd
Not too bad, but not too good+N+I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed...+dvd
Beauty and the Beast+P+It was great to see that they have the Cannon Tales on DVD now!  My daughter and I used to watch it together when she was an adolescent and now she is going to be a mother herself.  I purchased this so that my grandchildren will be able to view the movies that their mother watched when she was little.  A fairytale with the stars+dvd
Much needed and appreciated...+P+While this might not be for everyone, it is something to behold. I happened upon the 'O' show, as she spoke about it (wayback when) and I was very intrigued. Before that episode ended, my order was being placed for the DVD version, here. I purchased the CD version, after watching the movie. It was beyond words (I found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie) and I'm incorporating the Secret in my life as well as my family. I listen to the CD version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work, at night. It has helped me immensely and I'll continue to do so. I'm so very glad that I decided to check here for the hardcover book...hooray, the price has been reduced...yipeee! I'll get that as soon as I'm done with this review. Thanks Rhonda Byrne and aloha from Hawaii+dvd
Eh. Not really.+N+Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (Jonathan Liebesman, 2006)  In the documentary that serves as one of the DVD extras for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, a number of the movie's connections talk repeatedly about how their goal for this movie was to push the envelope with the gore. One even says that the people who went to see Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) will go to see this movie and expect the violence to be kicked up a notch. Well, folks, I just saw the unrated version of your movie, and I've only seen the rated version of Hostel. And I hate to break it to you but, well, even cut by the censors, Hostel blew you out of the water.  For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty-two years, a quick plot summary: there's a very odd family living out in the middle of nowhere. When the main local business, a slaughterhouse, closed down, it took most of the population with it-- save this family. (The fact that the slaughterhouse is still in operation in the original film, and there are neighbors in some of the original canon films, seems to have completely escaped screenwriter Sheldon Turner [The Longest Yard].) As with any TCM movie, there must be a batch of clueless teenagers, here two guys-- Eric (Tru Calling's Matthew Bohmer), on his way back to Vietnam, and his brother Dean (Zerophilia's Taylor Handley), who's planning on ditching the war and heading for Mexico-- and their girlfriends, Bailey (Diora Baird, recently of Wedding Crashers) and Chrissie (The Fast and the Furious' Jordana Brewster), respectively. There will also be a lot of revving chainsaws.  Now, I readily admit I'm one of the people who didn't recognize the brilliance of Tobe Hooper's original vision for a lot of years after I first saw the original film (close to twenty, in fact)-- thank you, DVD commentary, for pointing out so many things I'd missed my first few times around. I'm still not sure it deserves the classic status it has come up with since, but it's a good, solid piece of work, groundbreaking for its time. There hasn't been a single film, canonical or no, following it that's lived up, but the straight remake Marcus Nispel popped out with a couple of years ago has been the best of a bad lot. Unfortunately, it looks as if the sequels to the remake will have the same relative quality as the sequels to the original-- worse. The acting is wooden, the direction pedestrian, the special effects pretty good but nothing special. But what these guys were after, they tell us, was something really over the top. They were striving not to make a good movie, but to make the mother of all splatter films. And, quite simply, even within the Hollywood machine, they were well upstaged by Hostel before they even started filming. *+dvd
Not that funny+N+I was expecting a glimpse of some of richard's funniest acts. the DVD does not do that. It merely interviews people who knew him and give you a glimpse about his career with some takes from some of his stand up shows.   I was under the imppression that I am purchasing a DVD that shows some of his funny shows, stand ups and maybe a DVD of something new about richard. (A never before seen show or something like that)  Never the less, He never fails to be the funniest comedian that ever lived.  +dvd
BEAUTIFUL LOSER+N+You may ask yourself immediately into The Black Dahlia, why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match, that goes on for several minutes, between two L.A. police officers. What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder.+dvd
negative stars for this one+N+This movie starts out with an incomplete back-story, 500 years before the main story.  But, unless someone is well versed in the Bible, or the Torah, the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment. It jumps to the main story for a few minutes, then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs, but it's still not clear what is going on.  The description says Hadassah hid her religion, but it's not as hidden as you'd think it would be.  Over and over again, she and her uncle talk about being Jews, the housekeeper calls them Jews, their friends call them Jews, and there are even more flashbacks to Hadassah's childhood showing how she grew up Jewish.  She even reads from a scroll of a Biblical tale to children in the market.  If this is how she hides her religion, I'd hate to see what she'd do to flaunt it.  Actress Tiffany Dupont tries to give Hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world.  She's a teenager longing to explore her roots, and the world at large.  This would go well in having teens relate to her, but the dialog gets in the way.  The writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the Bible.  The complex dialog is spewed out, sometimes as quickly as possible, without any real inflection.  This causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable.  And, unfortunately, even the more seasoned  actors stumble over the formalized wording, further distancing the viewer from the story.     If you're really into Biblical stories, then maybe you'd enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic, it's best to look elsewhere.  (I could only endure a half-hour.+dvd
Better or Best?+P+A very good video even though it is not scripturally correct in a few  places. One has to remember that it is based on a novel and not directly from the Bible. Magnificent scenery, excellent character selection, and very well produced. This is a video suitable to be shown to christians or non-christians alike+dvd
Good disk as advertised+P+Product arrived on time and in EXCELLENT condition. My compliments to your vendor for his honesty and integrity+dvd
A Favorite!+P+This is one of my all-time favorite movies!  The atmosphere is dreamlike - expressed in the boy's sleepwalking and the unrepressable subconscious - a thing that communism disavows.  Thus, the boy's very being becomes an expression of natural defiance toward the coming communist regime under Tito and its spirit-crushing regime. A classic flic.  Highly recommended+dvd
Excellent performance VERY POOR VIDEO EDIT!!!!!!+N+As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream...+dvd
Everbody Loves Hook!+P+If you need to buy a gift for a kid from ages 3-93, Hook is a good movie to purchase. It was great seeing Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman battling it out in NeverLand.+dvd
This movie is why Fairy tales should not be revisited+N+Fairy tales are written the way that they are written for a reason.  And when greedy producers and actors and directors realize this maybe the world will be a better place.  The characters in Fairy Tales aren't suppose to grow up. They are written for certain age groups and are moral lessons about concequences in life and how she/he's life will change depending on which choices that one will make and direction she/he follows+dvd
Disappointing+N+Unfortunately I have to express a degree of disappointment on this film released on DVD. Whilest I enjoyed the acting & storyline, I was extremely annoyed on the number of scenes which had been deleted from the main film and shown as additional scenes within the main menu - for what purpose I don't know - it just seemed to leave gaps in the film which certainly detracted from the enjoyment. I remember seeing this film many years ago and rated it one of Rock Hudson's and Julie Andrew's most cherished performances - however the deleted scenes really robbed it those memories+dvd
The only things preserved are a few names+N+As far as a shoot-um-up with the obligatory car chase goes, this movie did it quite well. And like many of the other "1984" machine churned out films for the proletariat, the title and a few names bear the only resemblance to the Ludlum story. Quite a few of the characters that give this story depth and mystery are left out of the movie completely.    Now let's not compare this quickie in shoot-up land with the well thought out book "The Bourne Identity" by Robert Ludlum or the much better portrait of the story in the Mini-Series "The Bourne Identity" (1988) starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith; then we can enjoy what is left.   A sailor on a fishing trawler spots a human body in the water. After retrieving it we find it is alive. Helping this stranger back from the near dead we find a couple of bullet holes and a mysterious capsule under his skin. The capsule displays what the fisherman recognizes immediately as a Swiss bank account. The man can not remember who he is. Now we follow along with his journey to Switzerland and find out if he will recover. In the mean time someone is out to kill him. Why?   +dvd
Fitness Seeker+N+While the content of the exercise program is good, the production quality is abysmal.  The sound swithces from normal to very echoing, dim and "under-water" sounding every third sentence.  The visuals flicker, and alternate from color to black and white.  The filming is very unsteady, as if the cameraperson is just a beginner.  I contacted the company and they sounded very unconcerned about these problems!  Because of this, I am reluctant to purchase another Living Arts-Gaiam product+dvd
Corny, Predictable, Blah.....+N+Don't bother with this unfunny, predictable, boring, pedestrian, fingerpainted drivel.  The piggy stole the show+dvd
Baseball Mysticism - Give us a choice+P+My all time favorite sports movie next to "PRIDE OF THE YANKEES" and "HOOSIERS". The only criticism I have is that they should have made TWO ENDINGS. The "upbeat one" used in the Hollywood release and the " gritty downer ending" as read from the final pages of the book. And let the viewer choose before watching the film. I'd still pick the one used by Hollywood but it would have been nice to have Malmed's literary ending also.+dvd
Pretentious+N+I like some avant garde filmmaking, in particular animation, ex. Norman Mclaren, Harry Smith. But I feel like these Brakhage films are a farce of what an art film is supposed to be like. The filmmaker seems to take what he is doing so seriously that it goes into parody of an "art" film.  I've seen college level work and home movies that are more insightful and entertaining.  I had the chance once to see Stan Brakhage live in New York to screen one of his newer films a few years back. It was a film he shot in Vancouver of the beach, and, seriously, it was like watching somebody's home movies of the beach. Then afterwards he goes into a discussion about the film and how it represents him dealing with illness and life and death. He was so pretentious and full of himself I had to laugh. The emperor has no clothes+dvd
DVD documentary+P+Such a raw account of the people and destruction of New Orleans from huricane Katrina. Done extremely well and touches on areas that I wasn't aware of. Personal accounts from the people who went through the hurricane and footage I have never seen. Had to own it after I saw it - an excellent unbiased record of history+dvd
Requires Active Viewing Participation+P+This is a singular masterpiece in film making but totally unlike anything, even for it's day.  By today's attention deficit disorder standards, this film is really really odd.  But no doubt it is a masterpiece if the viewer is willing to put the effort in to catch all the nuances because this is a film of nothing but nuances.  Tati himself is just one of many participants.    There is a plot of sorts dealing with a group of female American tourists and the one women who is the odd duck among them.  She meets Tati and they spend the night together dancing at a night club and see in the dawn at a coffee shop.  Various bits of business are constantly swirling around them and you could view this picture 10 times before seeing everything.  There are many jokes but they are gentle visual puns.  Don't expect belly laughs, just a wry but amazing view on modern life.  As is standard practice for Criterian these days the extras on disc two are spectacular.  The documentaries on Tati's life and this film are brilliant and helped me understand his art and this film much better.  A gentle film with brilliant use of wide screen (this film would make no sense pan and scan) you need to fall into the picture to enjoy it.  But there is an endless wealth of material to enjoy+dvd
Stick with Suspiria+N+I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria. I like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work. It does have all his imagination but not his style. Pick it up with Phenomena and maybe youll like it but I doubt it+dvd
Good '80s action cartoon+P+We have here 12 episodes of the classic TNMT series based on the comic books by Peter Eastman and Kevin Lair.More characters are introduced:Letherhead the Florida swamp alligator,Usagi Yojimbo a rabbit samurai from another dimension,Lotus the female ninja and Metalhead a turtle robot created by Krang.There are more than 190 eps.If Lionsgate continue releasing volumes with 12 eps each 15 or more will be necesary to include all the seasons.Will be better release  full season sets with 30 or 40 eps each one.Hope they can hear this+dvd
No Form of Escape+N+With a pacing that only Tsai Ming-liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy "House of Sand" steps into the genre best described as the Foreign Doldrums. Moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we didn't get along too well. The entirety of the movie takes place in the Brazilian desert, a place that we movie fans rarely get to see. However, as you may have guessed, not a lot happens out there. There isn't even a weeping camel out there to keep us company. We watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere (no explanation given) and then dies, stranding everybody else there for three generations. I know, how can I criticize a plot for not having any developments (other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt!) when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters. And to that I would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film.  Pretty much everything goes as would be expected. People walk around bored, some of them die off, there are some minor romances, and everything looks beautiful. About ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and Aurea, the crazy man's wife, desperate for anything that moves, strikes up a love affair with one of them. He promises to take her out of the desert, but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening. Throughout more soldiers will arrive, and the females will always view them as tickets out of town, there to be seduced and exploited. Do I believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny? Maybe, maybe not. In the end the point is made that living in the Brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon, to which I would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart.  Another minor complaint I would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles. It would be fine, in a "Three Times" kind of way, had they bothered to label the passage of time. Instead I was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave. There is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber, but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew. You have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this, and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off. "Rain" and "Elephant" leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique. These characters really may have been marooned out in no man's land, but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away. I wasn't lucky enough to have seen this in theaters, but I would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk. Awe-inspiring cinematography does not make a movie. . .and here is my proof. **1/4 +dvd
It's a PERFECT example of today's horror movies+N+Which isn't a good thing. If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed? Please, give me a break.+dvd
I agree, this is a great intro to Tai Chi Push Hands+P+I've always wondered what Push Hands was - this video explains that in great detail and teaches how to learn in a very gradual manner. I got my copy last week (...)  Im glad I finally found this DVD, because it shows exactly what I was looking for - I once saw two women 'pushing hands' in the park and was fascinated, but have never found a video on the subject until now. Nice sound and picture, and Dr Yang seems to be a very nice teacher+dvd
Reflections of Amish Life.+P+I was born and raised in Mansfield, Ohio--now living in Anaheim, California--last 40 yrs.--a gal I work with-her sister just bought a home in Stow, Ohio--which is near Ohio's amish area--living in Mansfield, Ohio-I grew up doing Sunday family car rides to the amish area of Ohio--I have my own videa of the amish train ride from my last visit to ohio--I wanted another video for my gal at work to watch and appreciate what her newly located to Ohio sister can see of the amish area,  so purCHASED ABOVE VIDEO SO COULD SHARE WITH GAL AT WORK--SHE WAS AMAZED WHAT A RELAXING LIFESTYLE AMISH PEOPLE HAVE--WE TOOK A MINI VACATION WHILE WATCHING ABOVE VIDEO--THE ORDER ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION. THANK YOU+dvd
very poor quality+N+I watched this and would have probably liked it if the people who made this video had taken the time to produce a decent product. The lecture volume swings from low to extremely distorted and at times cannot be heard much at all. It was very disappointing considering the price and during the lecture Will Henry had slides that he presents with use of a laser pointer and you have no idea of what he is really showing to you or pointing to on those slides which are also barely legible on the video. My advice would be to pass on this one it isnt worth the time it takes to watch even if you got it for free.+dvd
Robin Hood (Disney Classic)+P+Its just one of those movies you like to have in your library and I love good old classic cartoon movies.  Such a fun movie to watch and enjoy with the family+dvd
Loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding+P+This movie pictured a sizable segment of the U.S. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement Mediterranean family. Many Italians I know  said that it could have been their family. The movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted. I enjoyed the wry humor.   At the beginning I was prepared to hate her father. He was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual. And the women of the family were so cynically manipulative. It did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid. He had only the best in mind for his family, and that included his daughters, and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the United States.  One other detail pleased me; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world. Not only do they learn academic things, they meet wonderful people from other cultures there, fall in love, and marry them.  The photography was wonderful and the acting was superb, especially since  the movie was made on a tight budget.   This is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.  +dvd
Well....+P+Jason Scott Lee is gorgeous.  All the rest is commentary+dvd
For your own safety, make sure you know where the emergency exits are at all times"+N+I did not expect much from this comedy, I just wanted to have a few laughs. I knew that many critics hated it and advised the viewers to stay away from it. Well, they did not like "Meet the Fockers", either but I had a great time watching it. They praised "Something's Gotta Give" to the high heavens but I wanted to kill somebody while suffering through so called "one of the best comedies of the year". They universally agree that latest Woody Allen's comedies suck - and I believe that they (Woody's comedies not the critics) are funny and enjoyable. Plus, Jane Fonda came out of retirement to make "Monster-In-Law", her first movie in 15 years. I saw a few weeks ago Fonda's "Barbarella", one of the silliest and campiest movies ever made and I liked it a lot, mostly due to Fonda's charm.   I watched "Monster-in-Law" last night and I found it uninteresting, boring, and irritating. The worst quality - it is not funny. Forget about laughs, I hardly smiled at all. I almost fell asleep - its 101 minutes seemed like eternity. Every twist in so- called plot was predictable, every joke -stupid, the ending - sappy and mediocre. In one word, the movie was a mess with only one redeeming value - Wanda Sykes (Ruby) as Fonda's personal assistant. Both, J.Lo and JF tried hard to do something with the material but it just did not work. In the perfect world, if Woody Allen had written the script and made the movie with three of them, Fonda, Lopes, and Sykes - we could've had if not a masterpiece but a wonderful and funny comedy. Alas, we are not in the perfect world and this monster is not scary, it is just pathetic.   +dvd
one of the 80's worst action movies!!!+N+bottom of the barrel action with one of dolgh lundgren's worst preformances(so you know it must be really bad) as a soviet officer sent to kill an african leader. when he gets there he changes sides and helps the african people against the soviets.     sounds much better than it really is ,the action is flat as is the whole movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! skip it!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
Dolph Lundgren's  version of "Rambo"+N+I think this was one of Dolph's better movies. It does a pretty good job of representing the factions in Angola. It has a solid plot. Red Scorpion does what its supposed to do, which is make Dolph the savior of the people in Angola while showing off his body. Its unrealistic that one man is going to come along and single handedly end a war thats been going on for years (especially in Africa) but thats why its only a movie.  +dvd
Preview it before you show it.+N+I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans+dvd
Domestic Life Well-Acted, But with Little Insight+N+Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').  But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.   Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichéd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché?  Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.   We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters.+dvd
Where is the button for -0- stars?!+N+Thinly veiled attempt to push politically correctness down the throats of our children, sacrificing the faith and beliefs of their elders in the attempt.  Aren't we so fortunate to have filmmakers to teach our children for us what their priorities and beliefs should be?  Oh pleeeeze! I'm so glad I could watch this one with my daughter so I could point out the obvious attempts at manipulation.  We discussed the issues, and thought for ourselves.+dvd
Nail on the head+P+I watched this film when it was originally released theatrically. I remember that the response from the audience was much the same as the response I remember when I saw Robocop (had to sneak in) in the theater: A few people clapped enthusiastically and the rest looked around at each other as if to wonder "Is it O.K. to have enjoyed this?...."  I, myself just enjoyed the well assembled action and the perfectly timed humor.  A few years later I joined the Army and a few  years after that...Well you know what happened....  I have to say that I appreciate the satirical component of the film much more than I did at the time. At this point most people can appreciate that war is hell ( that cliché' is for real, 100%  unadulterated ,  bone fide , certified, and not-likely-to-change-in-the-near-future, FACT).  Even if one begins righteously, that is with a proper justification, the physical realities of what happens on the battle field are no less horrific. There are tools on the battle field that are there strictly to turn your average teeny-bopper into softball sized chunks of red stuff (I mean that literally).  Verhoeven understands this and does an excellent job of contrasting that reality with the type of fantasy rationalization that is required to (at least successfully) prosecute large scale violence. For me the most poignant moment in the film is when then main characters confront the Bugs for the first time and witness a fellow soldier being ripped to shreds. The female trooper who "Joined to have babies..." makes an absolutely blood curdling shriek and then turns to run.  The look on the actress's face and the sound of her voice, completely captures the feeling one gets when one is being fired at in anger. Whether one admits it or not. I highly recommend this film. I think it should be required viewing.+dvd
Edward Norton....+P+nailed his part. Excellent movie even if it doesn't line up with history a bit.+dvd
The Best Pokemon Movie EVER!!+P+IGNORE THE *OTHER* REVEIWERS WHO SAYS THAT THIS MOVIE SUCKS. THEY'RE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a beautiful, suspenseful movie that brought tears to my eyes and made me cry. The action kept me on the edge of my seat. And, there were surprises!   This is the best Pokemon movie ever, regardless of what the other reviwers say. Though, I don't know why they released this one and the second movie in theaters, instead of the rest.  Buy this movie, you won't regret it!  Unlike most viewers you say, "Pokemon sucks", "The Pokemon craze is over", "Pokemon is getting old", YOU'RE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
The king of sleeze-Jing Wong forgets that he had Jet Li starring in this movie+N+Jing Wong truly sinks to a new low with this movie.  Jet has one oustanding action sequence but other than that, he just isn't used.    Jacky Cheung is the star of this movie and plays an actor who absolutely never uses stunt doubles.  It became apparent within 5 minutes that this movie was made to make fun of Jackie Chan.  Of course it didn't have to be so obvious but Jing Wong just keeps driving it into your head that he does his own stunts.  So if you are familiar with Jing then you know this isn't going to be a tribute to Jackie.  Oh no, it is a punch to the throat through the movie screen.  Jet Li plays Cheung's bodyguard and ends up doing the a stunt for him.  After setting up his stupid Jackie Chan character, Jing tries to do a remake of Die Hard.  Remember how you never knew what Bruce Willis was going to do and it was always surprising?  Well Jing makes about the worst movie possible from here on.  Instead of being clever, he makes Jet just keep storming in on the hostages and then flee.  At one point he takes a helicopter up and starts shooting right into the buiding at the main bad guy with all of the hostages standing around.  After the helicopter crashes into the side of the building it doesn't blow up, it just destroys everything on that floor.  So other than one outstanding action sequence between Jet Li and Ben Lam(guy with sunglasses), this movie is a complete waste of time.  Even Billy Chow couldn't save this one.  Of course it would help if Wong Jing was smart enough to capitalize on the success of Billy Chow and Jet Li in 'Fist of Legend', but instead we don't get to see them fight and get to look at Billy Chow in a thong.  Yeah, that it just what I am looking for.    The Universal Laser and Video company version is OK but the imbedded subtitles are sometimes hard to read.  There is a version of this released by Dimension Video(grrrr)that has been retitled Meltdown and has been shortened by 10 minutes and also has gotten a horrible new soundtrack including English dubbing and rap music replacing what was in the original.  Doesn't matter which one you get because the Chinese version isn't really any better since it is not a good movie to begin with.  +dvd
Romeo Must Kiss Juliet+N+Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out.  Romeo must kiss Juliet.  Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky.  A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers+dvd
Too sentimental, but beautiful... Wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving...+P+Widely acclaimed for his serious ambitions and his uncompromising perfectionism, Stanley Kubrick has won for himself a unique degree of artistic freedom...  Based on a true story of a slave revolt in 73 B.C., Dalton Trumbo's script mixes the melodrama with some quite moving moments... The film depicts the Roman era, the brutality of the slave system, gladiator combat and the decadence of Roman senators... What emerges from the screen was a passionate statement on behalf of freedom and men who were willing to die to overthrow oppressive governments...  The credit for the film's style belongs to Stanley Kubrick, who handled scenes of intimacy and scenes of gigantic sweep with equal attention, illustrating the violence, brutality and corruption of both, the masters and the slaves, raising the question of freedom which justify the human cost...  Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus the idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny and just by opposing tyranny he inspires his followers with his example...  Spartacus' character, from a violent primitive rebel who hamstrung a foreman with his teeth, into a gladiator who fought desperately for life in the arena, into an enraged rebel who drowned his gladiator trainer in a huge caldron of soup, into a revolutionary who was able to unite an amorphous mass of slaves, and deserters into a force which succeeded to defeat Rome's best trained armies, into a charismatic leader (with a vision) who forces a long-awaited revolt against the Roman empire...  Two political rivals (Crassus and Gracchus) use the slave uprising threat to manipulate the Roman senate for their own ends:   Crassus (played powerfully by Laurence Olivier) extorts 'a fee,' the dictatorial post of First Consul, Commander of all the legions of Italy as his price for releasing Rome from Spartacus... Crassus sees the defeat of Spartacus' army as a chance for him to seize power of the empire for himself...   Crassus tries to make the slaves betray Spartacus... He tries to win the love of Varinia, not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus... In his last confrontation with Spartacus, he is seen losing all his delusions of grandeur as he stands deeply wounded by the total disregard in which Spartacus holds him...  The screen legend Charles Laughton plays, with expertise, Gracchus, a generous Roman politician, soft and rich, able to get his Julius Caesar (John Gavin) elected leader of the Praetorian Guard to annoy Crassus' ambitions...  The first hour of "Spartacus" contains many of the film's best moments : The operation of the gladiatorial school and its training program is impressive and also expressive... The gladiators school is tough but fair... The men are oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged and trained to fight... They are never allowed to kill... For their good performances, they are even rewarded with the companionship of a young lady...  In this degrading manner Spartacus meets Varinia (Jean Simmons-lovely as ever) and it is his love for her and his hatred for his captors that inadvertently sparks off an uprising and the gladiators break out...  Particularly effective is the scene in which Crassus and his "capricious over-painted nymphs" (Nina Foch & Joanna Barnes) ask to be entertained by the sight of two pairs fighting to the death...  The scene summarizes the injustice of the situation, the cruelty of bondage and the insurrection becomes a triumph easy to understand...  Nominated for six Academy Awards, and winning for Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Supporting Actor--Peter Ustinov, the motion picture contains no chariot races and no orgies but it still imparts the grandeur and the decay of ancient Rome...  With a stirring musical score by Oscar nominee Alex North, "Spartacus," masterfully directed by Kubrick, is too sentimental, but beautiful, wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving...  +dvd
Much Ado about nothing+N+I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. And the end is kind of loose.  Give it a mis+dvd
Deceiving and Insubstantial+N+After seening and reviewing Fahrenhyte 9/11, I chanced upon this film and watched it.  It is deceiving and insubstantial.  As the #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, including most of the important books about national security, 9/11, oil, and terrorism, I have to state there are exactly TWO points of truth in this shallow stupid little film:   1) the photo of Bush reading a book upside down was a fabrication, Bush was actually listening.  2) Clinton blew it.  Correct. Madeline Albright will go down in history for refusing to let her staff report terrorism honestly, and Tony Lake will go down in history for failing to get it right.  It bears mention that then Commandant of the Marine Corps Al Gray did get it right, in his article "Global Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's" published in the fall of 1988, but no one wanted to listen.  I am impressed by the teacher of color who was in charge of the classroom that day, recounting how she felt Bush was truly presidential, and wise not to add to the panic by rushing out of the room.  Absolutely.  Good point.  The rest of this extreme rightist propaganda tract is totally disconnected from reality and the truth.  The movie claims that Gore lost because of Nader, and completely ignores the hard documented proof that the Florida leeadership acted to disenfranchise over 35,000 people of color, one reason that the Bush family was so confident, in advance, of victory in  Florida.  This trashy film fails to address the many angry Representatives and the inert Senate, including Gore, who failed to use the power of Congress to redress the impeachable wrong done to America in 2000 (and again, this time in Ohio, in 2004).  Anything that features snap-shots of Ann Coulter is very likely to be loosely related to the truth, reality, or the public interest.  I am glad I watched this film, because it reconfirms my gravest fears--the extreme right in America now has a propaganda machine more powerful that Hitler's, and a brainwashed following more lethal than the Hilter Youth.  This is seriously troubing stuff.  I gave Moore four stars, one star down for being too glib by half.  That's an honest assessment.  This shallow little movie gets two stars, and both of those are for reflecting what is in the small minds of the nutty right+dvd
Tedious, ham-fisted direction, groan-inducing dialog...simply awful+N+Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.  Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?  Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.  Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination+dvd
History by a Great Story Teller+P+This is far too big and rich a film to be contained in any summary description. It is rich in its beautiful depictions of childhood, family, and of sexual love, rich in its narrative of the growth of fascism, and fascist personalities, in pre-WW II Italy, rich in its analysis of the unjust relationship between the owners and the workers of Italy's farm lands, rich in the beauty of its sets, costumes, and scenes. It is a rough, rambling, long film, badly dubbed in the English version, but it is also an indispensable, inimitable, and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern European history. I saw the "short" version of the film shortly after its release in 1977--it did not have a long run in the United States--and never forgot it. I saw it again, just now, thirty years later, but this time, the director's much longer cut. It had lost none of its power.+dvd
Review of DVD not production+N+Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel. Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode. It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television. If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market+dvd
Thirteen Year Old Janey is a Victim of Sexual Abuse+N+This is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting.  And no, I'm not even slightly exaggerating.  It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out.  Janey is only a 13 year old teenager.  She is indeed rather mature for her age.  Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her.  Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law.  Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined.  The father is being played for a fool.  This dysfunctional family seems doomed.  Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection.  Is she capable of handling this responsibility?  Will matters finally get out of control?  "Rain" is morally bankrupt.  The story line takes place in New Zealand. Perhaps the people associated with the American TV program "To Catch a Predator" and "Perverted Justice" should visit this country.    David Thomson Flares into Darknes+dvd
Disappointing+N+First of all, for the caliber of actors in this movie, they deserved a better script.  Michelle Pfeifer and Peter Gallagher are class acts, but really this movie just did not dig deep enough. I have read all the rave reviews of Claire Danes, as I have read all the raves in the past and I am beside myself. I mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee. If this is her niche, so be it. The premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on. Completely understandable.  Then his annoying sister in law and  her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead. Oh my god, stop the presses. These people had the sensitivity of androids.  It would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house, but then the film would'nt drone on and on,  This is a good film for a rainy day.  But I expected more+dvd
The Wild Side+N+There are two versions for this film , which is not generally known.  Someone selling it should.  I was not informed when I bought the G rated version.  THe repy I received was, "too bad.+dvd
The D Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+This is a great little movie for D enthusiasts. I feel that if a viewer doesn't "Get the D" they will certainly not like this movie+dvd
A good show... if you can stand to watch it+N+After a year-and-a-half wait for the corrected version (the first run had major technical issues) to be released in the U.S., I finally got to sit down and watch this latest live DVD from The World's Greatest Metal Band Ever. Man, was I ever disappointed. I had heard bits here and there about how people didn't like how (Maiden bassist) Steve Harris had edited the footage, but ordinarily I find it's never as bad as people make it out to be. I was wrong. It's that bad. The whole concert is put together with a rapid-fire pace that might be cool for a video single, but not for an entire live show. No shot is ever held for more than 2 or 3 seconds, except between songs.  If you have the CD's you know this is Iron Maiden in their finest live form, but on the DVD you'd never know to look at them, because you can barely see them.   The bonus stuff on disc 3 is pretty good if you're a Maiden diehard like me, but nothing new, really.  All in all, buy the CD, stay away from the DVD, and join me in waiting not-so-patiently for a DVD release of Live After Death, Maiden England and Live at Donington+dvd
Bad movie+N+This vile, pretentious dump of a movie sucks joy out of your life.  Breillat exhibits no love for humankind.  I find something to like in most movies, but Breillat has made it onto my small enemies list with this one.  Not someone I want to be spending my time with.  I think the last movie I hated as much as this was "Johnny Mnemonic".  If you do watch it, make sure you have something good on hand to wash the taste out of your mouth.  I'm going for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.  Singing in the Rain would probably be even better.  For balance, I will add that there are a couple of scenes which have some human interest to them.  But mostly this is a cold, cruel, inhuman flick+dvd
Superb interpretation by Mia Farrow+P+As a mad fan of Woody Allen, I have to recognize that his ex gives a show of interpretation in this film. She is simply delightful! I gave "only" four stars because if other films by Woody deserve only 5 stars, then a give 4 for this but 5 for my other review "THe Front"+dvd
Fine film ruined by voice-overs on this DVD.+N+A solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors. Both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best. If you are averse to dubbing of fictional films, you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous. Clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles. But in the age of DVD it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film.+dvd
One of the best movies ever, and easily the best in the series+P+I'm a huge fan of 2, 4, and 5 but this movie just gives me everything I want------Great Acting, GREAT fights, good sets, GREAT stunts, and the best score ever.  My only 2 problems with this movie are the Americans being portrayed incorrectly and no Yuen Biao showing his true skills.  I mean yuen biou is no jet but he is better than 99% of movie martial artists.    But, jet is in full form and only in fist of legend wil you see anything close to that you are seeing this.   Also the baddie(who is not a bad guy, just more fo an opponent for Jet) in this movie hasn't looked this good since shadow ninja.      I have seen this edition and it is the full 134 min. with a decent Ric Myers commentary+dvd
Room 101 Revisited+P+After expecting "The English Patient, Part VI" We were pleasantly surprised to see Ralph Fiennes head off into uncharted waters.  A dark blend of "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "Brazil" emerges in a fully-formed recreation of the Stalinist revolutionary state, with subreferences to practically every dictator who graced the Twentieth Century.  Donald Sutherland has a chance to shine in a fabulous Castro-esque (the early years) beard, and We were also highly impressed with Lara Flynn Boyle, and Tom Hollander as the son-turned-heir, an unfortunate dictatorial truth still being played out in North Korea.  Mr. Hollander was suitably portrayed as a short man next to the leggy Boyle, and the 1950s Peronist costumes set an appropriate tone.  Draw whatever conclusions you will from the film's final scenes- they are the results of torture and re-education camps- but many Russian, Cuban, Argentinian, North Korean, Chinese, Afghani, Italian, Cambodian, George Orwellian dissidents would agree that "Land of the Blind" is a superbly accurate and ironic piece of work.   +dvd
Kevin Coughlan is spot on!+N+I'd write a review for this sewage, but Kevin did it so perfectly that I'd be wasting my time. The only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was Silent Hill, and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game. And now, there's a Spyhunter movie coming out? WTF is next? Prince of Persia (...please don't do that one, I was only kidding!)?  Get the video games for the real thing+dvd
German with English subtitles version is better!+P+Of the two versions I saw, I preferred the German version with English subtitles.  Garbo's performance as well as that of the supporting cast was more inspired.  I will keep looking for that version before I buy+dvd
Suspense at its best+P+Alfred Hitchcock works wonders in relating what the actual movie audience does -- sit in a theater and watch events unfold througout a narrative sequence -- by portraying that in his film "Rear Window."  Through the eyes of Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), we see the events that lead up to the suspicion of a murder that happens across his courtyard. He sees the events unfold through the window of his apartment, just as we see them on the movie screen.  Hitchcock uses suspense, point of view and camera angles to suck the audience into his own little movie world, with just a little voyueristic flair thrown in+dvd
Was almost decent until.....+N+they introduced the RED TAPE. Uhmmm that made the whole movie null and void for me. After that it just seemed like a very drawn out Veronica Mars "Halloween" episode.   *SPOILERS*  This film is about evil spirits who have a vendetta against pc's, cellphones, and PDA's. God forbid you own either or else you will be visited  by one of these beings. Forget about being killed on the spot. It just makes you so depressed you want to commit suicide or better yet you turn into what looks like remnants of an ashtray. Oh but wait, theres more you can keep the spirits at bay w/ red electrical tape. Sounds preposterous right?! Well it is.   To sum up, this movie was a hot "thrown together at the last minute" mess.+dvd
Not at all What I expected+N+Cradle to Grave was, for me , a let down. I expected to see more Jet Li action . He seemed held back, as if he could not fully express his abilities. It appears as though he did not want to "show up" the other actors.  As much of a Jet Li fan as I am, I regret to say that this move disapointed me.  BMX and Jet Li did not fit together well. I think that Jet Li's part could almost have been anybody else.  The story also disapointed me. It did not seem right that a cop,(from Tiwan) and a thief got together to save the world. It didn't make sense.+dvd
Britney the real Simone+P+Did you get a chance to see Pacino's movie "Simone"? The premise: Hollywood uses a computer program to create and mold the biggest female star ever.  It's pretty obvious (and has always been) that Britney has very little musical talent, but they molded her into the biggest music icon in 2000. On this DVD you get a chance to relive her early greatness in videos like "Sometimes", "Baby one more time", "Oops I did it again". Those were such wonderful videos (directed by Nigel Dick). Britney looked so beautiful and happy. It's very shocking to see what that happy little girl became today. Nobody would have thought that this squeeqy clean girl would be prancing around hollywood with no panties, on drugs, and shaving her head bald. These video's are not only entertaining, but they are also a window into the Britney transformation. The video "Lucky" from her oops album in particular is strange, because Britney really became the Lucky girl (lost in an image, with nobody there to wake her up). By the 3rd album, you can see Britney smiling less, becoming more sexually deviant, and singing "Im a slave for you". Her last album has shocking video's such as "Everytime", where Britney dies in the bathtub (from what looks like suicide). Sure, she pops out of the tub at the end to let us know she is okay, but it's still very strange. Also contained on this DVD is Britney's unfinished video "Outrageous" (from her 4th album). Britney is totally out of her element in this video, pretending to be a home-girl in the ghetto. She jumps on snoop dog (the rapper) and licks his face like catwomen (from batman 2). That was quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.   Well, Britney just got out of rehab, and I hope she will be okay. People on the internet are already betting who will father her next child. Aside from what you believe about Britney's lack of talent, she is a human. That's right, she isn't Simone. She is a human, and makes mistakes just like anyone else. She tried to entertain us. The least we can do is give her some sympathy and hope she finds her way. +dvd
Did I ever tell you about the time I invented snowboarding?+N+Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous "raunch" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.  I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like "This movie is just like Out Cold".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, "Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some "characters" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.  If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire "King of the Mountain" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.   Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the "cut & paste" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.  Grade: ** out of ****+dvd
You need a crazy sense of humor to watch this+P+I never thought this would be as funny as it was but it was. You really have to have a wacky side though, the same side you would use when you watch Anchorman or Harold and Kumar go to white castle. I understand some people not being able to get on this level of crazy stupidity to laugh at this but if you are this is definitely a movie you and your friends need to watch. There are a lot of hidden jokes you won't get until the second time you watch it like when the new owner left his Hummer parked outside and I just got a was spray painted in front of hummer sorry if you don't get it. Snowboarding buddies Rick (Jason London), Luke (Zach Galifianakis), Anthony (Flex Alexander) and Pig Pen (Derek Hamilton) are living like kings on Alaska's Bull Mountain. Partying hard, looking for girls, and doing just about anything to have a good time is what life on Bull Mountain is all about. But when town founder Papa Muntz dies, his son Ted (Willie Garson) decides to sell the mountain to a nasty Colorado ski mogul John Majors. Everyone is going crazy because they're losing their jobs and they can't afford to keep living where they are. By his plans to turn the boarding mountain into an espresso-and-tofu ski resort, and it's up to these idiots to save the mountain.+dvd
Nothing funny about it+N+Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over+dvd
No "When the sun goes down"+N+Wouldn't you think with the title of the collection being "When the sun goes down" that it would actually include the video to the song "When the sun goes down"?  Apparently NOT!  The only reason I ordered this DVD was for the video/song titled the same as the collection and it's not even there.  +dvd
One of the best+P+This is one of the best live DVD's ever. Some of the songs are more impressive on this DVD than on their studio CD counterparts. The Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are exceptional. The behind the scenes extras are very entertaining and enlightening. The crowd has great energy, as does the band who are getting even better with age. Video and audio are high quality with a really good 5.1 mix. There aren't many concert 5.1 mixes that I've liked but they got it right on this one+dvd
Another equal sequel+P+Very few sequels live up to their famous firsts, even though Spiderman 2 and Shrek 2 recently shattered this premise.  This is another in that rare grouping, running at an entertaining 12 minutes longer than the first.  This time we learn of the existence of a whole network of Spy Kids, and Carmen and Juni have to prove their mettle against a well heeled sister and brother duo from hell.  Their adventures take them to a mysterious island, invisible to radar, where "The Island of Dr. Moreau" meets "Sinbad", "Jurassic Park" and "Fantasy Island".  Star turns by Ricardo Montalban as Carmen and Juni's grandfather, and Steve Buscemi as the nutty scientist, as well as cameos by Alan Cumming and Tony Shaloub increase the entertainment value fourfold.  The rival Spy Kids dialogue and superciliousness go against the grain sometimes, but the gadgetry is as brilliant as the first, even though they don't always work when needed.    Imagination rules here, and if you like those old adventure movies with fantastic creatures and swashbuckling heroes, you will like this one.  Better yet, adults can enjoy it without needing the excuse of having a child.  Amanda Richards, May 5, 2005+dvd
Understanding Cuba!+P+An excellent account of how cubans escaped communist Cuba in 1994 building rafts and sailing across to their dream of America. It follows the lives for 5 people who made the crossing. The film follows their struggle on arriving in America and looks at their lives 6 years on.  This is a True Story which is still happening today. The film is in Spanish but there are subtitles. Get the hankies ready!+dvd
A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!+P+Simply the best voyeur experience you can have.  The men are hot and not afraid of showing off. the best Du Stade making of ever+dvd
It IS a jungle...+N+Boy, this DVD is just a jumble of old episodes, which are fine. But, it's just not cohesive overall. Feels very disjointed when watching it.  The good thing is my 2 year old loves watching it. She only learned "m" and "u" from this overpriced DVD, but at least she likes watching it.  I must say, I was afraid she wouldn't like "Meet The Letters" after watching this DVD countless times, but she does (I highly recommend Meet The Letters, if you want your young ones to actually learn). Oh, she could call out all the letters after watching "Meet The Letters" for about 2 weeks. Is it because she watched the jumbled "Jungle" for about 3 weeks earlier? Maybe. But, she sure heck didn't call out the letters while watching it (other than "M" and "U" as mentioned).  This is a good DVD that entertains. I would've actually gave it at least 3 stars if it weren't for the price ($[...] B&N), considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with Elmo, Zoey and Telly. +dvd
Good compilation of live show, with Promo footage to boot+P+The Anthology is a very good collection of 3 live shows from Bruce Dickinson's, pulled from many sources.  DVD ONE has Tattoo Millionaire tour live footage (DIVE DIVE DIVE), and Skunkworks Live. The DIVE video is poor quality shots, and the sound is not the greatest.  My favorite is the Skunkworks footage.  That album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden.  It's good to the footage done when it was still fresh, and laugh at Bruce trying to be "alternative".    Disc two is just Scream for Me Brazil in yet another package.  Good song set, playing Bruce's best solo work ever (Chemical Wedding Material), but it's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens.  Pretty disapointing disc, could have been left out, made the package cost less, and no one would have missed it.  This keeps this DVD from getting 5 Stars      Disc three is the cool best part of this package.  The promo videos are just nice to have in one spot. The Tyranny of Souls promo video is interesting, and where else are you going to find the Samson footage.  All of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video (like knowing the "Tatooed Millionaire" video was directed by the pink floyd "Learning to Fly" directory...now the connection is made).  Nice job with the last disc.    Overall, I feel the skunkworks video and the Promo material are the best parts of this collection, and make it worth the 10 dollars I paid for this.  I would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection, because the bulk of these DVD's is filler on disc two, and I would feel ripped off by it.      If you have been a long time maiden/dickinson fan, get this anyway. +dvd
What a great Compilation+P+Bruce Dickinson is one of the greatest performers of our time.  Not only is he fronting one of the greatest metal bands (Iron Maiden, in case anybody didn't know), but he is also an accomplished solo artist, as well as a master fencer and airline pilot.  Bruce can do it all and he is'nt slowing down!  Anthology is a must have for Bruce completists.  As far as I can tell, everything is here.  3 concerts, videos and interviews all on 3 DVDs.  Most of this stuff I've not seen before or it has been a long time since I have seen it.  Such as the shows.  Most of the videos I have not seen.  MTV does not play the good stuff and niether does anyone else, so if you have'nt seen the videos, this set is for you.  Bruce conveys an intelligence that a lot of metal performers don't exhibit.  He stands above the rest and is certainly an individual muscian that is'nt afraid to try new things. If you're into Maiden and Bruce's solo stuff, you will like this set. Also, Roy Z., Dickinson's producer and guitarist is phenominal.  Adrian Smith is always a joy to watch and all of Bruce's different solo bands spout great musicians.  Bruce is a god+dvd
SIX Stars If I Could!!!+P+The Art of Knitting was great for a beginner knitter like myself.  A few minutes after popping in the DVD I was on my way to knitting my first hat.  The Knitting Library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection  to knit by was wonderful.  This DVD is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike.  If you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then I would highly reccmmend this DVD because the knitting lessons with Jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor.  There's so much on this DVD you just have to see it for yourself, I know you'll love it too! I can easily see why this is the #1 knitting DVD on the market. Go and buy it+dvd
worth watching+N+The movie is not good but a lot can be learned by watching it through, even though it drags. The 1950s 'babe' played by Jayne is a period piece, but having lived in Las vegas for the past five years, I can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city. The  film is about a certain niche, created by men and probably by religion too,  and into this niche women step and become stigmatized. The whore or babe is  like the witch in the medieval period - something demonic and devilish. I  assure you, the values in the film are not out-of-date. The movie also is  an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism - espec.  Italian and the NYC area. And you see in this a connection to Las Vegas  too. The film, if it teaches anything, teaches us that we are far less  emancipated, liberated, rational, liberal, etc. in regard to sex and to  women than we thought we were. Again the parallel to witchcraft is a good  one: naive liberals thought the witch-hunting was over in the early 1700s.  In fact, witches were burned in all major European ocuntries into the late  1700s. And 1950s babes a la Mansfield are not only the adult identity of  many, especially in Las Vegas, in the year 2000, but are probably the  role-models of 6 and 7 year olds. ...+dvd
Wonderfull everything+P+It has been a long time since I have seen this movie and it really impressed me. I had forgotten how great Donald Oconner wa+dvd
to many options+N+If you are looking for a simple yoga routine this is not the DVD for you. The DVD has a yoga stretch for about everything, but it doesn't put a routine together. It was also hard to navigate from one program to another. there are better DVD available+dvd
FUNNY ROMANTIC COMEDY WORTH WATCHING+P+Barrymore and Fallon work well together in this sports nut romantic comedy. One of the better ones I've seen in a while. A good DVD transfer  and some funny extras make this a good buy+dvd
Funny Movie...just a bit harsh in some ways.+P+I really like the Red Sox Trivia and memorabilia found in this movie. It was so fun to see so many of my favorite Red Sox Memories on a movie screen. I thought that Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore did a great job. There was a great chemistry bewteen them. That is to say...I was convinced that they were in love. The ending of the movie was great. I liked the drama of watching Lindsay run across Fenway Park just to get back together with Ben before he sells his tickets. I think the best word to use when describing this movie is "cute."   However, I'm just tired of watching movies that make men look like idiots. Clearly, the main focus of this film is the stupidity of men and how they need women to teach them how to act appropriatly.  I mean, in many ways, Ben is no more mature than an eight year old. That is an extreme and unfair portrayal of male baseball fans in my opinion.  +dvd
Excellent movie+P+I grew up watching martial arts movies and always wanted to see one that has more depth and meaning.  This movie does not follow the sterotypical path of most chinese martial arts films.  The actors communicate on many different levels that one would not expect.  I was very pleased and inspired by this movie.  This will be on the top of my favorites list for many decades+dvd
Fans of Woody Allen will like it+P+This was a pretty good Woody Allen film packed with well known celebrities. Woody Allen is playing a novelist named Harry who written books based on people he knowns. He doesn't tries much to disguise them and upsets his friends with his tales. There are funny moments when the movie segues to his fictional characters. My favorite is the one with Demi Moore. The one with Billy Crystal is pretty funny too. In Harry's real life I got a kick out of Cookie the goodhearted prostitute.+dvd
I wish they would have +N+just left Bridget alone! This movie just doesn't do the story line any justice. She was living happily ever after, which is where I like my favorite movies to end+dvd
It had potential; I'll give it that+N+The last time I saw the names "Adam Goldberg" and "Giovanni Ribisi" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan.  Goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long.  At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to "Memento" or something of that nature.  What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution.  Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning.  Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey.  Rabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble.  Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him.  Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him.  Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales.  We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring.  The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all.  The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat.  If you like Independent films, or want to try something different, by all means give it a try.  I don't see it as being something I would watch again, or have in my collection for killing time on a Sunday afternoon with+dvd
It's 10 o'clock.  Do you know why your children are cackling insanely?+N+"Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU+dvd
This Movie was very Disappointing+N+This movie is strickly for the women now I see why it was made for the lifetime channel. It was hard for me(as a man)  to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters.  I was looking for a happy ending and didn't get it. +dvd
Tru takes on a 2nd season & the plot thickens+P+When Tru Calling's pilot started I originally thought, "well, this show will be cancelled soon". it was messy, unoriginal & kinda lame. but that's how it was supposed to start. then the 2nd episode was more believable & was a little better in every area that Pilot lacked! & from then to the middle of the season, it had its high points & its lows, Closure being one of my fav episodes! then, enter Jason Priestley as Jack, I'm thinking, why on Earth is he on this show? they must be desperate or something. but his character suddenly started making the show more interesting, things started moving faster & the show became darker, there were more things going on in the episodes & by the finale, Tru Calling hit its high point! everything was looking good for the show! but had they started out that good, maybe Fox would've gave it a better promotion. One of my fav moments is in Death Becomes Her when Jack saves Harrison's car by calling the thief's bluff. & from that moment, you have to know there's something up with Jack. especially after the audience presumably found out that he got a girl to commit suicide by making a phone call to her parents telling them about her constant gambling. & then with some help from Tru, Davis has to re-find out what he did on day one & tell her that Jack also relives days which in the next episode we find out why. He's there to stop her! & after getting Luc(Mat Bomber) killed, he takes a vacation & hopes that Tru will stop saving lives that are suppose to die. but Tru doesn't give up & when Jack comes back, things start getting tricky.  Perfect Storm- 5/5 Jack's return makes it difficult for her to save the life of a cop who died in a white squal but Jack sending her back out in the water at night makes it even harder after Davis saved her the first time by making a "phony" phone call. & Davis gets a replacement psychiatrist & things don't go so well with her.  Grace- 5/5 Jack sets Tru up for murder & things hit rock-bottom before they get better for her.  In the Dark- 4/5 In one of the more obvious deaths for the viewers anyway, Tru is forced to figure out who died after a party is thrown by her brother at the morgue. Jack keeps Tru on her feet & makes her go on a wild goose chase.  The Last Good Day- 5/5 My fav episode of Tru Calling. Everything changes when Jack gets asked for help from a girl who commited suicide. now the only question was, why? & why does the relive day feel so cold to Tru?  Enough- 5/5 Tru crosses the line when she tries to save life of her boyfriend Jensen as Jack tries to stop her & even Davis warns her of the reprecussions of saving the life of someone who doesn't ask for her help. She shouldn't be able to choose, it's up to fate. but she doesn't listen & something severe does happen in return.  Twas the Night Before Xmas, Again- 4/5 Harrison finds out about his dad's alliance with Jack but before he warn Tru, her day restarts. Tru reluctantly lets Jack help her in solving a murder case possibly after an old cadaver asks for help.   It's an ok ending cause it at least it isn't a cliff hanger but it's a shame it didn't get a whole season & stupid shows that shouldn't be around cause their just getting stupid(cough*the oc*cough) are still on??? but Fox screwed Tru Calling, see my review for the first season for more about how ticked off I am at fox, lol.  plus some features on the show & I think anyone should get into this show! the second season could've been so great had they had a whole season! these six episodes are worth your money just the same! a memorable show too bad it wasn't given a real chance cause it did become something great! +dvd
Highly Recommended Eye Candy+P+This DVD showcases some of the best visual artist talent in the VJ and nightlife industry today all mixed to some killer trance music.  All of the visuals are stunning except I am not a big fan of the contributions made by Bionic Dots.  They seem to be overly paranoid about showcasing their work so they obnoxiously brand their content with annoying info bars across the bottom of the screen.  The video content is great as is for playing at parties or can be utilized as source material by any interested VJ in mnay creative ways.  This DVD is well worth a purchase for anyone that has been mesmerized by video screens at a top nightclub or underground party - highly recommended eye candy+dvd
total utter nonsense!!!!!!+N+this is pure drivel!!!!!clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film;like the director wasnt given enough money to make it,so he thought,you know what,im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film,that'll show them.the &quot;plot&quot;,if i can re-tell it without vomiting,is thus:a plane is struck by lightning,and kills all the pilots..............i kind of lost what was going on after that......the ending,if there actually was one,was that whatever predicament they were in,they got out of.where can i begin?????clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics,as they'd have pointed out that this ISNT POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!im a little bit rusty on my physics,but isnt it called a faraday coil???if not then forgive me,my minds a little indestinct,but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane. &quot;what about the glass,it passed through the glass window!!!&quot; you bark smugly,well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people,you ever been hit by lightning indoors??have you ever heard of this happening in real life before??NO,BECAUSE IT CANT!!!!!! well done,you're learning.anyway,enough of the banter,the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop,the cable(??!!) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense,some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish,a hint of romance between a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;female human being&quot;,and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says &quot;i skipped bail&quot;,&quot;are you a criminal?&quot; she asks!!!!!! well of course he is you stupid fool,he just told you!!!! any time there was &quot;turbulence&quot; the camera was wobbled about a bit,and the &quot;actors&quot; moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments,where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car,that was brilliant!!!!he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead...then later he gave the oxygen mask,great!!!!! all the scenes involving the radar room,they were something else!!!!the ending also,the rubbish CGI aeroplane,what a laugh!!!!i could go on and on and on,pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film,but i think ive said enough.in short,dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash,then this is definately for you!!!! i laughed nearly all the way through it,so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5+dvd
A child's favorite.+P+A true fan of Pokemon would enjoy this movie.  It is now my two son's favorite of all the Pokemon movies in their collection of movies+dvd
This goes waaaay too far - unrated version+N+First of all - even though most of my friends hate them - I must admit that I do enjoy watching some good horror flicks. My DVD collection is also primarily concentrating on this genre. Besides classics, such as "Psycho", "The Haunting (original)", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist", "The Omen (original)", "The Shining", "The Changeling", "Halloween", "Alien" and "The Evil Dead". I also enjoy more recent flicks, such as "The 6th Sense", "The Others", "The Ring (US version)", "The Grudge (US version)" "The Descent", "Dawn Of The Dead (Remake)" and "TCM 2003 Remake". The Problem with "The Beginning" is, that  A. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts. Which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie! B. Nobody gets to know why Leatherface turned out this way. Damn, they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in "House Of Wax". C. There is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense. These facts, especially the last, make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as "Wolf Creek", "High Tension", "Hostel" and "Saw (Sequels)". As one re-viewer stated. Horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares. This movie sadly couldn't succeed, due to unnecessary gore, splatter and blood. I don't need that+dvd
You could numb your brain thinking about the paradoxes, but an Excellent Film+P+I would love to discuss the paradoxes in this movie but that would give away too much of the plot for those who have not seen it, which should be the reason your reading this review.  Any story dealing with time travel will have them, it is unavoidable.  Think of the "Grandfather Paradox".  If you were to travel back in time and kill your grandfather, you would never exist.  If you never existed, you could not travel back in time to kill your grandfather.  So for purpose of this movie you must suspend your disbelief.  The plot of this movie is brilliantly cohesive, as it can be.  It just requires a lot of thinking.  This film is beautifully shot, has great acting, and a great story.  I definitely recommend this one.+dvd
A Hitchcock Film In Name Only That Goes On For Ever+N+I have nothing against silent films. In fact Clara Bow's 'It', Lon Chaney's 'The Phantom of The Opera' and Louise Brooks's 'Pandora's Box' are amongst my all-time favourites. But with the exception of 'The Lodger',  Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife'  certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT  when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one  sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus  points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis  introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good)  score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this  DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look  to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock  enthusiast+dvd
When Life Is Not Enough?+N+This film seems to want to have it both ways - offering the premise that not all disability is disposable - just Sampedro's.  An incredible amount of talent and creativity went into a film that pays homage to ... well, plainly put - a man that was too petulant to live. The movie presents Ramon Sampedro - a talented, intelligent and articulate  man as someone who ultimately proves to be a self-pitying whiner.   It was not that he was not capable of living a life of accomplishment and satisfaction - he simply refused to. Despite the acclaim and admiration that his writing had brought to him, despite the devotion of those around him that loved and cared for him, Sampedro seems a bit like the child who gathers his marbles up from the playground and marches home because someone hadn't played by his rules. (Refusing a wheelchair? C'mon!)  Granted, the stress, humiliation and despair of being a quadriplegic cannot be minimalized nor discounted. However, giving up on what you may have once hoped your life would be for what it ultimately becomes proves to be difficult for all of us - no matter what the size or nature of our own personal challenges.  (Oddly enough the very limitations that he views as untenable are most likely the factors that pushed him to reach inside himself and find a voice that brought him such attention and celebrity. Imagine the platform that was his ... and was thrown away)   Yes, yes - allow the man to end his life if he is incapable of recognizing the gift that he squandered; let us be done with him if he so chooses. We should not, however, celebrate his cowardice - the easy out - this foolish waste of something precious. What an insult this film seems to those who struggle quietly everyday with half the talents, abilities or the emotional resources of devoted family and friends that were at Sampedro's disposal. Those gifts for which others could only envy, Sampedro discarded in self-indulgent and careless abandon. The joys that others could only dream about, he chose to reject.  It would be better instead for us to triumph with Stephen Hawking ("Brief History of Time"), Christy Brown ("My Left Foot") or Helen Keller ("The Miracle Worker") - each of whom had to face the equal of the challenges that Sampedro faced, but did not cower in resignation or mawkish self-absorption. Instead they rose above the limitations (those imposed on them either by themselves or those around them) and made all our lives better for their struggle.+dvd

Prom Night+N+Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended+dvd
Awful....+N+If you want to watch a Mad Max movie, buy the original because that's the only one that's worth it. This was a joke, plain and simple. Infact, it couls possibly be the worst film i've ever had the displeasure to see. The whole 'futuristic' setting is flawed with cheap and badly made costumes, make up and props such as swords and blades which look plastic. It was obviously made on a show-string budget. The filming and direction is nothing special, the script is terrible and the fight scenes are laughable beyond belief. It certainly appears that no proper training or rehersal went into any of it.   And the plot is boring, and the whole film drags on and on....+dvd
Historical value, but poor image quality+N+It's very nice to go back to those exciting years with this DVD, but they could have done a better job with the image digitalization. There is much better image quality bootleg DVD's out there with virtually the same content. I think fans deserve the best for the money they spend and unfortunately, this is not the case.+dvd
A lot of Joy+P+I have bought many VCR tapes and DVDs of old movies  in the past two years because I like seeing the actors, actresses, singers, and dancers of many years ago.  "That's Entertainment!  The Complete Collection" shows many, many of the best artists in show business.  I watch some portions over and over again.+dvd
Awful DVD - will be seeking refund+N+This review is about the regular edition DVD, not the Criterion one.  The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if they took a pan&scan print and chopped off the top and bottom, like the Back to the Future box set fiasco. I will be comparing to my friend's copy he taped off TV to see if it is so+dvd
Quiller Got Lost on the Way Home+N+The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.  The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.  The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home! +dvd
what a joke+N+This is the intelligence level of people who like the movie: "man dude this is a must see about time we all no jesus was black not the blue eyed painting that was push out for so long like they say time will tell and the dark will turn to light and oh there still hanging black folks to this day."    I'm sure the black community is thrilled to have so many people like this as members. +dvd
A Lot of Confusion Over This Film+P+I'm not sure what film Frankie Flanagan, Ross Hughes, 'A viewer', Breandan or Elizabeth J. Shannon were commenting on, but it doesn't seem possible that it was 'Bloody Sunday'.  Ms. Shannon, Ross Hughes and 'A viewer' seem to think that the film is pro-IRA - boy, did they miss the point.  As for Abe "Starman" in WVA, clearly he doesn't even understand the basic facts behind the film.  As for Roland Zwick and Gitana3000, I think they need to gain some experience in accented English.  The Northern Irish dialect is not that hard to understand.  Heck, go and see a movie set in Yorkshire, Glasgow or Durham - those are difficult accents.  It's a fact of modern realistic filmmaking that when a film is set in Northern Ireland it's going to feature Northern Irish accents - it's something everyone should be able to deal with.  Heck, I found the movie 'Matewan' difficult to understand, but I don't demand subtitles, or that they tone down the accents, for a movie that's in my own language.  Instead I learn to understand the variations - it's not that difficult, and it's something that stands a person in good stead when he ventures out into the real world.  Only in US documentaries and news shows do we see subtitles when people are speaking clear and intelligable English.  What is it with that?  I mean do people in New York need subtitles when listening to folks from North Dakota?  Anyway, rant over.  This is a great film which gives Bloody Sunday very evenhanded treatment.  Perhaps if people saw the film before commenting, and perhaps if they took the time to understand the film before they started to write a review, this film would get fairer reviews.  As others here have said, don't see this movie and think it gives an overview of 'The Troubles' because it doesn't.  It shows one day when one group of soldiers killed a lot of innocent people - as such it illustrates how poor armies are at keeping the peace - it shows how the British Army killed a few of the 365 people it killed during 'The Troubles'.  What it doesn't show is how brutal the IRA, INLA & other so-called 'republicans' (who killed 2153 people) or the Loyalists (who killed 1080) can be+dvd
Oscar nominated screen play, should have won.+P+I give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture. Otherwise, it would earn a resounding five stars. I have been waiting a long time for this film to be on DVD, but to find that they are insulting Robert Ryan again by providing poor quality DVDs of many of his films now on DVD. Most recent example in Billy Budd, which I also have been waiting to be on DVD for eons. Both The Naked Spur and Billy Budd should have been given first class treatment. Naked is only marginally superious to the VHS due to the soft picture (Mann's other Westerns have been transferred better). MY VHS copy of Billy Budd is superior to the DVD. I definitely won't buy the DVD. Another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of Billy Budd were deleted in order to fit it on the DVD. I wonder which scenes they were.  As for The Naked Spur, it is another Ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality. It is amazing how an actor such as Ryan can interpret malevolence so well, yet be a peace activist in real life. When Ryan's Ben Vandergroat cooly murders Jesse Tate, his deep seated cold bloodedness, which has only been talked about up to that point in the film, occurs at the moment when Ben kills Jesse. Ryan's final line to Janet Leigh as he lays in ambush for James Stewart and Ralph Meeker encapsulates his situation: "Pretty soon Roy and your friend Howie are gonna show up. Then I'll get me some more insurance against dying young.+dvd

Very overrated, narcissitic, and self indulgent....+N+I was immensely disappointed by this film. The "avant-garde" style of the film has been done better by other filmmakers (specifically Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, and Harmony Korine), and the film is mostly about Jonathan, not about his mother. The critics made this film sound like it was an attempt by Jonathan to bring him closer to his mother, to try and understand her by making a film about her, and to bring "closure" to their relationship. Well, the film isn't really about Jonathan's mother, it's strictly about him. We hear and see tons of information (with annoying title cards) about Jonathan's life, career, and loves. It feels like an episode of "this is Jonathan's life", as if Jonathan is this absolutely fascinating, brilliant individual that we must all pay attention to. He may become a great artist someday, but he isn't there yet. Jonathan uses his mother merely as an excuse to make a very self-indulgent, narcissitic film about himself. He doesn't really seem interested in her, other than as an excuse to show how much HE'S suffered, not really about her suffering. While Jonathan had a horrendous childhood, I felt very little sympathy towards him, as he is constantly mugging for the camera in a "feel sorry for me, I'm gay and my mother is insane" way. The man has been taping himself since he was in grammar school, so he's just a tad in love with himself, methinks. Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy is a film that deals with a schizophernic, and it is much more interesting and artistic than this film (Korine's uncle is a schizophernic). Derek Jarman shot his films in multiple formats similar to this film, like 35mm, 16mm, video, and super8, and weaved the images into an artistic and fascinating tapestry. Kenneth Anger, as well as Jarman, infused a gay sensibility into their films, which Jonathan doesn't do very well. Overall, disappointing, considering critics said it was absolutely brilliant....  +dvd
Seagal Saves the Day without Doing Many Actions -- So Boring+N+When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.  Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?   Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).   So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.  There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.   Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.               +dvd

It's 10 o'clock.  Do you know why your children are cackling insanely?+N+"Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU+dvd
Worst of the films to die for+N+The worst of the set 'GraveDancers' there was not one likable character in this one I didn't care about any of them, I wanted all of them to die, and it contained overblown special effects that were stupid at the end. Big ghost head chasing in graveyard, wow that is dumb.+dvd

Any one over the age of eighteen will want to drink a lot of beer while wasting time with this+dvd
a fondly remembered movie from childhood,it doesn't stand the test of time+N+i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it's age and it really gets the history wrong. part of the problem is that other than robert shaw's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost. the locations used don't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly. see battleground for a better take on this battle+dvd
AMW+P+this movie was very good. Voice talent was great, animation was great as well. I like the moral of the story-keep believing in yourself even when no one else will. Great family movie. Also recommended: Robots and any Disney Pixar film+dvd
Deciever is Far Too Overlooked and Unnoticed+P+I cannot believe the scarcity of people who have actually seen this movie.  Tim Roth is an incredible actor, and his intelligence permeates into a very believable role in a modern mystery/noir with staggering twists and turns of a mental battle between the interrogates and the interrogated.  The story pivots the balance of power like no other movie I've ever seen.  It is an exceptinoal psychological thriller that leaves you completely satisfied.  I had no complaints with the acting or music (You won't enjoy the ending as much if you don't like oldies music, however), and the story is top notch with a script that plays it out thoroughly.  The cinematography is above average, and very in sync with the music to make a great finale, and a great movie+dvd
Amazing film if you suspend your disbelief+P+Face Off is in my opinion an all time classic film, the plot at first glance is fairly ridiculous and unrealistic but it is one of those cases where if you suspend your disbelief you will love this film.  John Travolta plays Sean Archer a police detective whose son was accidently killed by Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) while attempting to kill Archer, who had been tracking him for several years.  Archer then makes it his lifes ambition to catch Troy, and early in the film Archer finally catches and apparently kills his man (Troy is in a deep coma afterwards), only after he reveals vague details of a chemical attack on L.A.  After interviewing his brother Pollux Troy, they find out there is indeed an attack iminent in L.A, but he will give no details of the location.  It is then that the undercover Face swap idea is suggested, from this point on Archer is played superbly by Nicholas Cage, who goes into prison to recover info from Pollux.  The plot dramatically changes when Troy awakes fom his Coma, after finding a video of the operation and finding his face missing, he calls in a few associates to help him.  The doctor who performed the operation on Archer then grafts his face onto Troy at gunpoint, the few people who knew about the top secret mission are then all killed.  From this point on of course Castor Troy is played by Travolta.  I won't give away any more of the plot but what follows is both hilarious and disturbing, both leading men are superb, but Cage perhaps just steals the show, as he gradually becomes trapped in Troy's body (as Archer).  A great plot, an all star cast and superb acting make this action thriller a classic, like most great action films, there are great high budget chase scenes, hilarious moments (usually courtesy of Travolta as Castor Troy) and excellent drama.  Instead of ridiculing the plot, watch this with an open mind and you will see a superb action film, which I believe to be one of the best of all time+dvd
Bond is Back!+P+Move over Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton. Daniel Craig is the best Bond in 20 years and has resurrected the franchise that was on life support.  The first thing you notice about Casino Royale is that it is absent of all of the cheesy gimmickery of the old Bond movies. The stunts and effects are believable. The acting is understated and real. The plot is fresh and new.   Daniel Craig's performance gives a hint of Sean Connery. But it's not an imitation of Connery. Craig makes the role his own. This is a whole new Bond. The cliche is that this movie is Bond for the 21st century (the terrorist angle), when it actually just brings Bond back to his roots. He is cunning more than he is charming. (unlike Roger Moore) He is different, he is new, he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her Majesty's secret service should be.  If you are looking for the trademark Bond staples such as the Martini (shaken, not stirred) - the easy women, the endless supply of Aston Martins etc... this movie may disappoint. Craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest "double-oh".  I suggest buying this DVD in 1080p Blu-Ray because of the spectacular cinematography, shot on location in Prague. It won't disappoint.  The best part about the movie, without giving too much away, is that the ending leaves you wanting more. Isn't that the goal of any great series?  I give it 5 stars. +dvd
A real treat of a movie, and an important one, as well.+P+The Firemen's Ball is one of a handful of Czech films that defined the &quot;New Wave&quot; era, and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world.  Other important films of this period include Forman's &quot;Loves of a Blonde,&quot; Jiri Menzel's &quot;Closely Watched Trains,&quot; and &quot;Larks on a String&quot; (a Menzel film that hasn't been released on DVD, to my knowledge).  But Firemen's Ball is a personal favorite, probably due to the fact that I lived in the Czech Republic for five years, and attended similar village balls.  The characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor, affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed.  In the end, Forman does what he does best -- he leaves you torn between laughter and tears.  This film is a must-see, especially for those who are interested in understanding how filmmaking evolved in the 60s+dvd
BRILLIANT, RIVETING...but NOT quite &quot;COMPLETE&quot;??+P+The bottom line is:  every JAM fan should own this immediately - the quality/range of the material included on this amazing 2-DVD set is AWESOME...BUT as much as love all the TV clips, archival footage (esp the cool &quot;Meet the Jam&quot; piece!), live segments, and videos, I do wish they would have included the VIDEO version of the Jam's final single, &quot;BEAT SURRENDER&quot; which I sometimes would see on early MTV - it's really polished and exciting, oh well...AND also, where is the stunning, raw set they did on ABC's early 80's late-night &quot;FRIDAYS&quot; show, etc.  These omissions are the only reason why I docked it one star - since it's really not &quot;complete&quot; but for any JAM fans, even casual ones, this is a definite MUST-HAVE keeper DVD you will go back to again and again!!  Makes you feel nostalgic and even a bit SAD for a time lost in pop/rock music, never to be returned! +dvd
She's the Man says it all+P+This movie made me laugh and the day I saw it I needed that laugh. Parts of the plot are predictable but it still "works".

"Who Do You Say That I Am"+P+'The Greatest Story Ever Told' had the very real potential of being one of the biggest disasters in motion picture history. Think about it for a moment. Who would want to sit through a 3 hour and 19 minute film about Jesus with a virtually unknown blond haired, blue eyed Swedish actor named Max von Sydow in the lead role? Add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in Hollywood. Sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project.  Surely director George Stevens pulled off a major miracle. Aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary Alfred Newman, some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you'll ever see and an unforgetable performance by Max von Sydow 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' lived up to it's title to become the definitive film version on the life of Jesus of Nazareth.  A classic from '64 that belongs in everyones' DVD library. One of the Essentials+dvd

KORDA CLASSIC.+P+Sabu appears to be having a very good time as Mowgli, the child adopted by wolves who lives among the wild beasts as one of them; he swings from tree to tree like a nursery Tarzan.  In the dark-green jungles of this lush, handsome Alexander Korda production (directed by Zoltan Korda) Mowgli has more to do with humans than in the original Kipling novel.  Patricia O'Rourke is around for a suggestion of precocious romance; also Joseph Calleia is there for posterity...the screenplay by Laurence Stallings perhaps wandered a bit from Kipling, the segments concerning the python, the treasure and the ruined city are still thrilling in their way.  Children will probably still love the movie, and adults will have a better time than they expected... Look for a very young, very American Rosemary DeCamp+dvd
Classic Whoopi+P+Great movie....you fall in love with the character that Whoopi is trying to save.  It's classic Whoopi humor.....I love the slippers.+dvd
pretty cheesy+N+Big fan of Nas, but this moive's a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it. Visually flashy, vacant plot, and messages are reduced to sermonizing. Skip this and watch Juice instead+dvd
Very Disappointed+N+We were very disappointed with this Bob the Builder dvd.  My children love Bob the Builder and own every video.  We were excited to hear that a new one was coming out soon (especially on Dvd).  However, it is not new!  Every episode on this dvd is on the other videos (or has been on the Nick Jr. show at least 6 months ago).  I would have never thought they would release a new dvd/video without any new episodes.  If this is your first Bob the Builder dvd/video, then I would recommend it.  If you own many others, then don't bother getting this one because you have already seen it+dvd
Forget What The Professional Critics Say! This Movie Is Funny!+P+I have never seen the original old Unfaithfully Yours movie but I saw this remake on HBO and I thought it was very funny! Dudley Moore, Nastassia Kinski and the rest of the cast were great and I'm glad that this underrated movie is finally on DVD and I highly recommend it. Dudley Moore plays a composer married to a much younger woman played by Nastassia Kinski and he goes kind of mad with jealousy when he thinks she is having an affair and has bizarre fantasies of doing her in! But is she really having an affair or is he letting his imagination run away with him? Watch this hilariously funny underappreciated movie and find out+dvd
the NFL on VHS, transferred...yet again;+N+"Football Digest" once voted week four's 1977 Monday Night game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears one of the top 10 Monday Night games ever played (and arguably one of the greatest Bears games during the post-1963 NFL Championship season).  What was even more significant than it being Joe Namath's last appearance as a starter (or the last time anyone would see Broadway Joe at Soldier Field, and no one had seen Namath in Chicago since the Jets 1974 win over the Bears for that matter) was the fact that Chicago's Bob Avellini threw 3 touchdown bombs in the pouring rain to beat "Hollywood Joe" (who was knocked out of the game by Bears LB Waymond Bryant and replaced by Pat Haden for the remainder of the season) and the Rams 24-23.  Not only a great moment in Chicago Bears history, but a great moment broadcasted by  ABC's legendary Howard Cosell.  Just one of the many great moments left off  the "Chicago Bears - The Complete History" double DVD release.  What you have here is a compilation of old VHS Bears highlights (most of which were produced in the 1980's by NFL Films) assembled together by the NFL Network and transferred onto DVD.  Making it abundantly clear to real Bear fans that it wasn't compiled by a "real" Bear fan.  This 2005 NFL production plays more like a propaganda film than anything else (meaning; this is what "they" want you to remember).  A history of the Chicago Bears through their eyes, not Bear fans.  I found it rather insulting to have to listen to some spoiled brats (Virginia McCaskey) banter concerning a game and history of a team she knows nothing about.  What i mean to say is; why couldn't we get some insight from say...Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander (someone who actually covered the Bears) than someone who sat in a luxury box and picked her nose, totally oblivious to what was happening on the field (the Dave Wannstedt era of the 90's is a clear example of this).  Even more disturbing was the "Bears/Packers Rivalry" segment.  Packer fans will find this more engaging than Bear fans, considering the infamous "asterisk" game of 1989 (Green Bay's 14-13 instant replay victory)  along with Jim McMahon's 1986 pounding into the Soldier Field astro turf are covered with a fair amount of detail.  Although...i'm still trying to figure out why those moments would be more memorable than Chicago's 61-7 slaughter of the Bart Starr coached Packers of 1980 (which by the way wasn't mentioned at all here).  Instead we're shown (Ditka's continuing "fullback" saga) William Perry's 1985 Monday Night touchdown as though that were the only memorable moment of the Bear/Packer rivalry concerning Bear fans.  I mean...who's highlight reel is this? For a more comprehensive view of this rivalry, pick up Gary D'Amato's "Mudbaths and Bloodbaths" book. Although a bit pro-Packer in places, a good read never-the-less.  And after all, at this point in the DVD...anythings better than watching Green Bay's Don Majkowski spike the ball after scoring a TD (against the Bears mind you), on a Bears highlight film no less.  The NFL Network and NFL Films continues with its barrage of lowlights and insults levied against Bear fans by showing clips of the New York Giants 47-7 mauling of the Bears (in color mind you) in the 1956 NFL Championship, but failing to show any highlights from the famous snow bowl of 1977.  This was an important game to the Bears and their fans. It marked Chicago's return to the post-season for the first time since 1963. I can still hear Vin Scully's "watch Fencik lower the boom" on New York's Jimmy Robinson in one of the most devastating hits in the history of the game itself.  Chicago won the game 12-9 (a classic nail biter) in the last frantic seconds of OT to capture their sixth game in a row and finish the season at 9-5 enroute to the playoffs.  But we're shown none of this.  Instead we're told how great Frank Gifford was before, during, and after a few clips of the 1963 NFL Championship victory over the Giants.  Again...who's highlight reel is this? Also, there was no mention at all of the Bears week nine game of 1977 (the game that started the 6 game win streak) against the Marv Levy coached Kansas City Chiefs (Bob Avellini's TD pass to Greg Latta as time expired to steal a 28-27 victory in the wake of another brilliant performance by Walter Payton) or the 1979 demolishing of the St.Louis Cardinals 42-6, to finish the season at 10-6 and secure a playoff birth (the day after "Mugs" Halas' death, and yet again...NFL Films failed to mention any of it).  And although it was humorous to see Abe Gibron's "wired for sound segment",  lets not forget...he never coached a winning team in Chicago.  Watching Gibron just reminded me of all those losing seasons after the 63' NFL Championship. And considering the absolute chaotic, mind-numbing bewilderment on the sidelines, it's a miracle the Bears won any games at all under Gibron's baffling direction. The only memorable Gibron moment would have to be 1972's Monday Night win over the Vikings at Soldier Field (the game in which Abe got carried off the field,...a huge achievement considering the fact that the Bears hardly ever beat the Vikings during the late 60's & early to mid 70's, and well...taking into consideration that it was a nationally televised game and  Gibron's weight (lbs)...it was probably the most work the players did all year). But even more poignant than that for Bear fans was the priceless blank look on Gibron's face, captured by the CBS camera crew during the last home game of the 1974 season. In the midst of a 5 game losing streak, a mere 18,000 fans showed up in the rain and sleet to watch the Bears Mirro Roder split the uprights in the closing seconds to clip the Giants 16-13 (known as the "fight inflation or conserve energy; stay home and watch Bears lose" game...only they won!).  But again...we're shown none of this.    Casual Bear fans will find this insightful and entertaining i'm sure. But real Bear fans will find this to be nothing more than an overpriced cheap VHS transfer of the same recycled  file footage NFL Films delivers whenever a Chicago Bears documentary is in order.    ...hardly a complete history.    olofpalme6+dvd

Language is not Russian (as stated by amazon) but Chezh. Be aware!+N+If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad.+dvd
WORTHLESS MESS OF A FILM!+N+They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series+dvd
What?+N+Being a Texas Chainsaw fan I of course picked this one up.  It has 2 big stars in it, and was directed by one of the writers of the original.  I'm not sure what they were going for in this one.  Is it a horror, a sick comedy?  It is all over the place.  What is worse is that they made Leatherface a wimpy crossdresser.  The ending leaves you scratching your head.  Mathew and Renee do their best with the material+dvd
Christopher Walken+P+Of course, Christopher Walken is one of the all time best actors and Abel Ferrara is an outstanding cult director. Their co-operation is probably among the best ever happened to cinema. Although the story itself is nothing to cheer about, especially where ex-con Walken goes charity, the acting and photography is worth watching this movie over and over again. Great acting by Larry Fishburne as well.+dvd
how do you say great movie+P+this movie was one of the better movies i've ever seen. as far as cute guys, great story-line, and talent go it's all that! i can't believe how  ne1 could not like it. i think it sends a very positive message out about  racial issues. and the movie also isn't mushy at all considering it's a  drama. if u like or dis like basketball it doesn't matter because it's  still a great movie no matter what! :+dvd
Not recommended+N+My husband and I were very disappointed with this DVD set.  One DVD contains an "action documentary" with music - we did not like that DVD.  We thought the second instructional DVD is mediocre and might be helpful if you are a complete novice.  The treatment of subjects is in our opinion pretty superficial overall.  There is little breakdown of technique.  There is minimal race footage, which is helpful to watch to learn by watching experts.  Parts of the footage seemed recycled - we heard very similar discussions about ski wax in the separate "tuning" and "equipment primer" sections.  You cannot watch the DVDs straight through as they dump you back into a main menu after you complete a scene.  So you must frequently fiddle with the controls to select scenes to watch.  That feature is helpful if you want to access scenes easily perhaps but we did not like it.  I am not usually a complainer but we were so disappointed with this set that I wanted to put up a review. +dvd
So many memories...+P+I am so glad that Family Ties, Season 1 is out on DVD.  This show makes my mind flood with memories from High School.  It gives me such a nostalgic feeling watching the Keatons' shenanigans from Season 1.  I surely hope that other season sets follow soon.  The show got better and better as the seasons rolled by in my opinion.  I've read the reviews which mention the intro music changes.  In my opinion, it really doesn't change the quality of the episodes at all.  I have been looking forward to this series release for such a long time, that it would have taken a lot more that the music changes for me to be disappointed.  But, hey, to each his own feelings.  I love the show and my boxed set of Family Ties:  Season 1+dvd
Had to try it+N+I dont feel bad reviews are a good thing, so all I will say is, the picture on the cover is really nice+dvd
superb+P+Very good movie.  Great acting & plot.  Very touching.  I am very glad I own this movie.  I will watch it very often+dvd
A TRUE LOSS OF FAITH.+N+Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army.  She was full of hope and life.  Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her.  She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died.   The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die.  Where was the mercy for Faith?  Where was the compassion for Faith?  Where were the people protesting for Faith's life?  Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith?  What about her suffering and that of her family?  Barely a foot note in this movie.  Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case. +dvd
Garfield - The Movie+P+I purchased this movie for my 6 year old grandson.  This is a perfect age for this movie.  He has watched it over and over again.  It is not so simplistic that he gets bored and is very entertaining and funny. Parents can at least watch it once without getting bored.  I highly recommend it+dvd
Oh the humanity...+N+As wretched as these two are, it's worth owning Miri just to witness a 27 year-old Michael J.Pollard passing as a 14 year-old and hearing Shatner emote "NO BLAH-BLAH-BLAH!+dvd
The best volume yet+P+This volume of Mai Hime is definitely my favorite so far.  There's tons of action, some really nice plot twists and drama to go along with it.  I won't give out any spoilers but if you have been watching Mai Hime and have been a bit bored or hesitant to continue watching this set of episodes really comes through on what we've all been waiting for.  My only gripe is that it has taken the series this long to reach its potential but I'm glad I stuck with it+dvd
Pythons can't dance, especially Terry Jones!+N+In one second season ep Terry Jones (what a common last name!) does a totally lousy, unfunny job doing a strip tease job. He can't talk well either. He really isn't that talented a performer in these senses.+dvd
I just didn't get it+N+This movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch. I don't like that; going back and forth and not knowing what they "want" from me. And I REALLY didn't 'get' the ending. I didn't buy the romance. The only thing I enjoyed about this whole movie was Kevin Spacey; that's it. Just skip through the rest of the crap+dvd
Superb+P+Just in case the preceeding reviews don't settle the question, I'll add my unqualified rave to the list.    The subject matter of this film is important for many reasons and is equally full of dramatic potential - this movie makes the most of both.  The screenplay is constructed like a Beethoven symphony - logical, constantly moving forward, boiling with energy.  The script, presumably, is based on the original transcript of the conference.  The acting - well - how can one praise it enough?  The human drama - the constant interplay of personal politics, intellectual fencing, bestial attitudes and genuine emotional reactions to the subject matter being discussed - it's captivating from first to last.  And the last scenes are superbly poignant - the final intimate focus on both Heydrich and Eichmann as shallow men and profound monsters, the use of Schubert (as both reference and musical score) to underline the moral desolation and irony at hand, the final roll call to enumerate the sober injustice of the participants' ultimate fate.  This is yet another HBO movie which raises the bar for American cinema, proving that one can still make a great statment on film without either large budgets or avant garde methods.  I can watch this over and over and always get something new out of the experience - which, of course, is the very best recommendation for actually purchasing a movie on DVD.  Buy it and watch it often+dvd
A must pass for true fans.+N+I have loved Riverdance since the first time I saw it on PBS.  I could wait till I received my Riverdance: Live from New York DVD so many years ago.  Recently, I had a chance to see it on tour when it came to Los Angeles.  I had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything I could hope for (with the exception of them having removed the song "Home in the Heartland" which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle).  That night, I ordered not only Riverdance: Live from Geneva, but also Jean Butler's Irish Dance DVD (Which I would recommend).  To make a long story short, don't waste your time with this version of the show.  The main female singer is absolutely horrible (Definitely doesn't hold a candle to Katie MacMahon's original vocals), and the lead female dancer's too short hair drove me crazy.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the 1999 DVD Live from New York.  I promise you won't be disappointed+dvd
PLUNGE INTO OBLIVION+N+DARK DESCENT is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding.  Filmed in Czechloslovakia, most of the actors and crew's names end in "v".  Which wouldn't be so bad if they could at least ACT.  Dean Cain, he of Superman fame, bullies his way through the mess, chewing his gum, and wincing after he gets shot in the leg.  Scott Wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits, but the movie never says what happens to him.  The movie starts off with Cain and Wiper (sounds like a law firm, don't it?) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant.  Nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this, but Cain kills them all but one, a nasty guy who plans revenge.  Meanwhile, many of the crew members are committing suicide, and Cain is investigating.  (Excited yet?).  Of course, it all culminates in a kind of underwater HIGH NOON when the bad guy who promised to come back, does so with two other goons, and chase Cain around the plant for a while.  There is nothing exciting about any of this, as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal. Try THE ABYSS or GHOST SHIP or any other undersea film, and you'll do much better than this waste of celluloid+dvd
Don't waste your time on this.... +N+What an awful and silly movie! The plot is absurd, the special effects are ridiculous and the acting is entirely forgettable+dvd
If this movie does not completely inspire you, you are an idiot.+P+What else can I say? Sixth Sense was bearable,the Village was not.  Signs was the stupidest movie ever made.  Lady in the Water was an emotional roller coaster that made even the harshest cynic in our family weep with sorrow and laugh till he cried, often transfering directly from one to the other.  Paul Giamatti couldn't be better+dvd
I agree with the first two reviewers+N+The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there.  I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING?  I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending.  It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces...+dvd
Nothing+N+Bad Movie, Bad action and you don't get to see almoust anything....   tho words : money waiste+dvd
Scott Leet blew me away!!!+P+Wow!  I wasn't expecting much watching this little movie "Out In Fifty" one night at home with my boyfriend.  But then at one point, I totally found myself engrossed watching this guy Scott Leet, who was playing this ex-con trying to get a second chance at life after getting out of prison.   I mean, me and my boyfriend were sitting there like totally in tears and suddenly we realized we were watching this amazing talent.  Scott Leet totally blew us away!    I mean he was totally ripped, totally COOL, totally...just mesmerizing.  He reminded us a lot of a young Clint Eastwood, xcept with lots more vulnerability.  Scott Leet could totally win an Academy Award someday.  He's really amazing.  And gorgeous too+dvd
Kind of Slow, but give it a go!+P+This movie starts off a little slow, but definately picks up pace. Its a great 80's movie and moreso timeless for anyone who has experienced love and heartbreak for the first time. It reminded me of my first High School romance. Many scenes are quite comical, and Cusack does not disapoint. Worth watching, you are sure to give a chuckle or two, at least watch it to make fun of the 80's fashion trends+dvd
Sigh+N+What a great premise and start to the movie as most of the world's children fall into a coma.  10 years later, no children are born that don't fall into the same coma.  The stock market crashes, riots, the world is uneasy.  Then the children wake up and they are out for blood.  Sounds great, and the children first waking up is really scary.  Then the story just falls apart, and the ending is just stupid.  Nothing is really explained, and you are left empty at the end.  No real gore and average acting.  Clive Barker's name is attached, but he certainly did not write this+dvd
KANE Lives!!!+P+What a surprise, this new version of C&C Tiberian Wars, is fantastic. The story is great, I've seen some complain about the story in thier reviews, but perhaps they should re-watch the "action scenes" (A new option in this version)when I did this I caught things I missed before, making alot more sense afterwards.  The graphics are great at full levels, but if you have an older computer there is an option screen to adjust to any option you need to make it playable or experience the best graphics, this also includes audio etc. The "cast" of the live action characters, are great, well known and big new stars!(Billy-Dee williams/Michael Ironside/etc etc) I recommend, this game for all veteran Tiberium fans, and any new fans that like RTS games, buy this--C&C started it all. I wasnt sure if the game would be as good as the past C&C Tiberian games, with EA in control now, but they really did pull it off with flying colors.    I have yet to play multiplayer--and have heard that a small number of people are having problems with multiplayer--but I have heard that the multiplayer problems will be fixed soon, so I'm keeping busy playing both campaigns (GDI and NOD) and hopefully the patches will be out by the time I finish+dvd
GOOD  FOR  SOME  LAUGHS  +P+This is a pretty good effort for a Warner home video dvd release.You get two Laurel & Hardy feature films on one single sided disc with nice artwork.Considering that these films are over 60 years old the audio & video quality is surprisingly good.If you're a fan of Laurel & Hardy,  this dvd is definitely for you.This is good clean fun from one of the best comedy teams ever+dvd
A funny, bizarre, disgusting comedy, yes, comedy!+P+Funniest, most bizarre, disgusting comedy I have ever seen and DVD has both great color and sound. It is Best when watched with ALL your Friends! You will laugh yourselves right off the couch!  For the Outrageous, Sick-Minded, Cult Classic Movie-Lover who wants to see Every Movie Containing Gore, Violence and Sex performed by Cute, Cuddly-Looking, Love-Sick, Violent, Disgusting, Vulgar, Uncouth Puppets.   ADULTS SHOULD WATCH BEFORE THEY LET THEIR CHILDREN as This film is Probably NOT intended for Most CHILDREN!+dvd
What more could you ask for??+P+A bunch of stoned girls running around naked on the beach! Black and white 1930's boobies rule+dvd
Note to Paramount: no sane person is going to pay more than $60 for a DVD set, ever+P+Wake up Paramount!  Take a cue from your sales on the STTNG sets.  Now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the FIRST PLACE, I would imagine that all of the hold-outs (like me) are now buying them.  See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a market fair price of $25-35.  So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range.  So, $60 is your sweet spot.  You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop.  So, do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people, drop the price to where it is supposed to be, and earn your sales.  Nobody sane is going to pay more than $60 for a season of an hour long/episode TV show on DVD, period+dvd
Very Disapointed+N+When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time.+dvd
I want 48 minutes of my life back+N+This could quite possibly have been the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire existence!  First off...Jim Carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public.(animals included) This movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store...it shouldn't be there.  The only laughs I had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie.  Sure you may come back and say it was a student film...but honestly, where the hell could he or she be a student at!!  Who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity.  Sure the girl was Fat...nbut that wasn't here main problem.  The acted like an idiot all the time and then ALLOWED people to call her BIG J!!  This is a complex written all over it.  This is BIG J calling was always followed by some cheap Yogi Bear impresion...once again retaining back to the fact that she's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear.  Jim Carey didn't even entered this movie untill about 20 or so minutes into it.  And just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film.  I was not impressed and don't recommend this waste o time, film, and brain cells to anyone thing.  Even if no one is watching this movie in your house, Please don't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the TV screen.  MY CAT DIED, WHILE VIEWING THIS FILM.  please heed my warning+dvd
In search of . . .+P+Eleven years old when his father, architect Louis Kahn, died in 1974, filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn sets out in search of the man he hardly knew by visiting the sites of his architectural creations, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, to the capitol building of Bangladesh. Along the way, through interviews, old footage and photographs, much is revealed about this elusive, enigmatic, and often difficult man - including a closely guarded private life with children by three different women, while remaining married to only one of them.  A personal film documenting the life and career of a public man, "My Architect" is wonderfully engaging, leaving the viewer with a complexity of emotions as we listen to the comments of those who admired him, those who loved him, and those who did neither. Especially revealing are the interviews with the two women, colleagues in his firm, who became romantically involved with him and years later still treasure the memory of him. An architect in Bangladesh sums up the final image of a man whose work was inspired by a kind of mystical genius and who gave his love to mankind.  Moods mix and shift gracefully in the film from the discomfort of seeming to disagree with his mother's reverent estimation of the man to the sweeping effects of time-lapse photography and a whimsical scene of rollerblading around the great courtyard of the Salk Institute. Included in the DVD is an interesting and informative question and answer period between the filmmaker and a small theater audience, with additional scenes not used in the film.+dvd
Great war story but skip the soap opera.+P+One of the great period pieces that the Brits do so well, this is the story of the British bomb disposal squads during World War Two, done by John Hawkesworth, the same guy who produced "Upstairs, Downstairs."  The story is told through a fictional bomb disposal squad commanded by a young engineering student turned lieutenant, Brian Ash.  Fascinating story and technical details when they stick to the actual bomb disposal material, but the personal stories are so much cliched fluff--the main one is that Ash falls in love with the daughter of a scientist working on the bomb disposal effort.  They are temporarily blocked by the fact that she already has a husband who is also doing an important job--he is one of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park working on the Enigma secret.  But not to worry--hubby obligingly kills himself so the lovers can get together with a clear conscience.  As the Church lady would say "How convenient!"  Also the one extra is nothing much, a documentary from the History Channel, not on the British bomb disposal effort during the War, but just a general piece on bomb disposal in general.  In conclusion,  if you like realistic war stories, buy it, but use the fast forward whenever Judy Geeson says "Oh, Brian!+dvd
Excellent Early Sean Penn Movie....Highly Recommended !!!+P+I picked this DVD off the rack as a random selection, mainly because I don't believe that Sean Penn has ever appeared in a bad movie....and this has got to be one of his best (even though he was probably still a teenager when it was produced in 1983).   He portrays a young delinquent purse snatcher and mugger named Mick O'Brien, who is rapidly escalating the violence of his crimes. Ultimately, during an attempted drug robbery his best friend is murdered and he accidentally runs over the young brother of his bitter enemy, Paco Moreno (fairly well portrayed by Esai Morales....he is definitely no Sean Penn).   Because of his youth, Mick is sent to a grim, grimy, violent juvenile detention center presided over by the "usual suspects": inattentive, seemingly deaf guards who allow atrocities to be perpetrated daily and with no consequences....prison trustees (Clancy Brown portrays one) who flaunt the rules, sexually abuse at will, and terrorize the inmates....and a warden who is a weak, fickle joke.   By standing up to the trustees and demonstrating his talents for mayhem and maniacal violence, Mick becomes the dominant inmate....in effect, ruling the place, until two things happen to challenge him: Paco rapes Mick's girlfriend (revenge for the death of his brother) and gets sentenced to the same juvenile detention center as Mick. They now hate each other more than ever, and are trapped within the same hellish institution....you KNOW that something horrific is going to happen.   Sorry, but if you want to see how this incredible set-up plays out, you'll have to rent or buy the DVD....and I assure you, it will be money well spent. The acting is superb (Sean is incredible, even as a teenager, exuding an undercurrent of barely-controlled violence); the plot is suspenseful and bloody but always makes perfect sense; the direction, cinematography, sets, sound, etc. are terrific. This is a genuinely excellent movie....I give it my highest recommendation.+dvd
Boring+N+This video is just boring. The picture is not to good but watchable. I hope this is the only video this guy ever makes. I do have to give it 2 stars just because it does show a lot of stuff.  They maybe should explain more+dvd
Radford removed the Eurythmics?+P+I love this film and have always wanted to make a sequel, I'm just a little miffed that they took out the Eurythmics music. According to one reviewer it was on the insistence of the Director, now grant it I do also like Muldowney's score (and own that particular s-track) and feel the newly replaced tracks work well in maintaining a bleak a-tonal atmosphere, I still sorely miss the eurythmics music and feel Radford should have left it as it is or at least made SURE MGM included a 2nd audio track version. This could be another unusual case of an artist not being the best judge of his own work, at least in my opinion I feel the eurythmics' added a unique flavor and spirit to the film. I can understand at the time Radford may have had studio pressure to use them as was overly common practice for just about any film made in the 80's to have a slapped on pop tune soundtrack from whoever the hottest flavor of the year was. Still i think this film was an unusual exception, interesting coincidence in the same year another pop group (Toto) surprised many with a great score for Dune.+dvd
Kudos to Criterion+P+I saw this movie years ago on VHS. This is the ultimate for collectors. Lots of extra goodies ala Criterion. Beatifully remastered. I have a couple other Roeg films released by Criterion, and again Criterion has come through with a quality product. If you've seen this film and liked it than this is a must have. When I rented this on VHS, it was an unrated version, but this one has had some additional footage added. Charlie S+dvd
A contrary opinion+N+Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.  So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including "Happy Together" and "Fallen Angels" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's "Breathless", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory.  The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate. +dvd
Too bad I'll have to forego...........+N+The many reviews I have read of "The Merchant of Venice" make me thirst nearly unbearably to purchase this DVD.  However, I cannot, for it offers no English subtitles, which I need to get the most out of a movie.  Especially Shakespeare, whose language is difficult enough to begin with.  I have "Much Ado About Nothing" which I adore & which does have subtitles.  Will look for others+dvd
Should be forgotten.+N+As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity+dvd
A classic+P+This is a horror sci-fi masterpiece just watch it...This film reminded me of videodrome and the fly and a little bit of eraserhead it might not be up there with them but its a classic for sure+dvd
All Tomorrows Parties.+P+Very interesting documentary of the &quot;Father Of Pop Art&quot;, a title which some dispute. But, as shy as he was, he was surely it's most visible and successful creator, who was as well known for his social life of the fabulous 1970's and '80's New York, as for his art. I don't know how interesting this film would be to non-Warhol fans, other than a one - look history lesson. But, to me,  a bored dreamer in upstate New York in the 1970's and '80's, Andy Warhol represented all that was glittering, creative, and exciting, and this film brought back a now gone time. His life did seem like a non-stop 24 hour creative/ social frenzy, but there was much more to him than that. The sickly, ugly duckling who was at the  &quot; beautiful peoples &quot; epi-center, if Andy wasn't there, it just wasn't an event...  it's all here in this film. The underground movies, the  &quot;Superstars&quot;, the Campbell soup cans, The Factory, his 1968 shooting, Studio 54,... He had many detractors,(envy does that), and many accused him of turning art into crass commercialism, but this film also talks about the good son and brother, and the generous mentor to young, then on- the- rise artists like Keith Haring and Jean Michele Basquiat. And the man who attended mass every Sunday, and spent almost all holidays feeding the homeless at Church Of The Heavenly Rest, something he told few about. He died much too young, and unnecessarily, leaving an estate of multi-millions, and the auction of his beloved, hoarded belongings, held by Sothebys, was the media event of the year, bringing in an incredible twenty-six million dollars. For someone who's been accused of being a charlatan, talentless, manipulator..., he was incredibly successful, and according to many, the New York City nightlife and culture  was never the same. Whatever he was, the little nobody who started out with none of the things that make one popular, became one of the twentieth centuries most well known artists and figures. This film is an informative visit to anyone who wants to know his phenomenon, anyone who wants to relive it, or if you just want to get to better know of the unique, talented man, who was no better nor worse than any of us+dvd
Extreme something+N+Some folks need only a paper-thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences, without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way. If that's you, this may be your movie. Xtreme sports, xtreme ops. Get it? If that doesn't strike you as xtremely clever, you may find this movie painful to watch. I'm thinking of telling The Agony Booth about it.   The humor doesn't work, to the extent that I think I want a laugh track after all. Or a drummer doing rim shots. Ba-DUM-bum! Characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms, hair style and/or color, or shouting all his dialogue. I didn't watch it all. I didn't even watch enough to tell you what it's about. Amazon or Imdb can tell you what it's about. Just something else we found in the flat. Someone's losing credibility as a selector of DVDs.+dvd
"look at that war wagon roll"+P+i love john wayne movies and this one is a good one. with friend kirk douglas, wayne plays taw jackson a man sent to prison by bruce cabot for a crime he didn't commit and cabot stole waynes land and his gold mine to boot. now wayne is out and wants payback and the gold. douglas is lomax the gunman who cabot wants to hire to kill wayne, but wayne gets to him first and they become parters in an atempt to rob one of cabots gold shipments in the title wagon. and what a wagon, its armor plated, has a gatlin gun mounted on it and has 12 gunman on horse back riding beside it.this is a very action packed western that has humor to spare and wayne and douglas look to be having the time of their lives together and it just makes the movie pop off the screen with energy. my boys watch this one with me and i've caught them outside playing like they are in the movie, so this is one of the best reasons i have to add this great western to the collection.+dvd
Enjoyed!!!+P+I really enjoyed this DVD........  I recently bought the recent release of The Ritual Path after seeing some clips on Nijole Sparkis and Fritz Heede's my space pages and really enjoyed the images and music so I thought I would give the Illuminated Manuscripts a try.  I really thought it was well done and would have enjoyed it just for the music. I guess it depends on what you are looking for as to weather or not you will like it. I watched on a regular TV with a $100 DVD player and thought it was great. Someone else may watch on a $10,000 TV and system and may still not be impressed. I looked at another DVD review that was mentioned and highly recommended by someone that didn't like this one, yet that DVD only had 2 reviews and not good.. So just a matter of taste and perhaps the digital age has made it very hard to impress a person.  I feel the DVD does what it was meant to do, provide some relaxing music with some wonderful scenes, perhaps the title Illuminated Manuscripts explains the writings and emblems that appear in the video.  Perhaps if you are able to watch some clips you will know if it's for you or even check out the more recent Ritual Path. I come from a rock music background and don't feel that I'm easily impressed but from my personal viewing I would recommend both the Illuminated Manuscripts or the Ritual Path. It's been awhile since I have seen some of the other animated clips mentioned in some of the reviews here and admit some of what I remember they were great, but these do what they were meant to do just like Chronos did years ago without the animation....+dvd
Long and Bleak +N+As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest+dvd
EXCELLENT Oscar worthy movie!+P+I think that Tsotsi was a very moving and inspirational movie; very worthy of the Oscar and all the awards that it won. It is so refreshing to see a movie that isn't marred by all the gliz and glam of Hollywood. Well done Mr. Chweneyagae and cast. We hope to see more of you in the future+dvd
If you want a rocumentary watch VH1+N+Very disappointed with this DVD.  Like I said above, if you want to view a rockumentary watch VH1 alot cheaper.  Description very misleading+dvd
Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake+N+I bought this recording for my 5 & 3 year-old grandchildren who love ballet. There was nothing in the Amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production. The kids and I were half-way through viewing it when I realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture. The principal women (mom & girlfriend) were evil and stupid respectively. The "hero"s" true love was an undisguised male swan (all the swans were male). There was no hiding the passion between the male lovers. Good grief!! [...+dvd
Moon River....this movie is all wet!+N+Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat.+dvd
I am convinced of their importance+P+I initially saw this played on the now defunct TRIO satellite channel.  At the time, I owned a once played copy of Doolittle.  After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.  Yes, the Brits in "Gouge" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.  I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be "that good for a start" - we are going to give it a shot.    I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.  A year and a half later, I am so glad that I saw, and now own this DVD - most importantly I "discovered" the greatness of Pixies.  I even went to see them at a small local venue in June 2005 (got Kim's autograph!).  I will be buying the "Sellout" DVD, when released in Oct2005.  I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of &lt; $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.  By the way, to the author of one of these commentaries - the name of the album is SURFER Rosa, not SISTER Rosa - you seem like you know what you're talking about, bone machine head!  LONG LIVE THE PIXIES ! ! +dvd
It didn't "Die Hard" enough, and the soft porn nude scenes are embarrassing+N+As bad as this is, and as horrible as Anna is in this junk the man who co produced and stared as the bad guy is even worse. He stumbles on Shakespeare's prose and delivers the lines like he has rocks in his mouth and is in awe of the fact he can say them at all! Frankly, so am I. That said, this is a very funny movie about a bimbo pilot, bad guys in leather pants and some "do hickey" that will "change the balance of power" .... un ...yeah..... ok. The soft core nude sex scenes are more funny than hot and are the only time Anna is able to act. At least when Andy Sadris ("Guns , "Hard Ticket To Hawaii, "Savage Beach") made his movies like this fun and funny)on purpose, and the had many playmates not just one. All in all this is one to catch on h.b.o. after midnight+dvd
Just because of Kate+P+What can I say?  I am a guy who likes Kate.  She has put on weight (real nice)and has a more sensual role in this "flick," while remaining her methodic, "Death-dealer" self.  Doesn't get any better than that for me.  Sorry ladies, ahh, not really+dvd

Talk About Values!+P+Somew movies just have 'values' and the original The Four Feathers is one of them.  FEATHERS is set in England and the Sudan about ten years after the Mahdi killed General Gordon.  In fact, seeing Charlton Heston in Khartoum would be a good lead-in to 4 FEATHERS.The plot revolves around four friends, all young officers in the same regiment and all heirs to an aristocratic military tradition heavy on the memory of the Crimean War (see the original "Charge of the Light Brigade" film).  Three men boldly go to the Sudan with General Kitchener's expedition.  One chickens out and resigns his commission, losing the woman he loves in the process.  To redeem himself, he goes to the Sudan on his own and must help his former comrades.  The story is well-explained, well-paced and has great values of timing, editing, and direction.  The technicolor and the score are both excellent.  4 FEATHERS is a cut above other British productions of the period in terms of technical quality!  FEATHERS also exemplifies the best values of the Victorian UK upper class-- belief in country, honor, loyalty, heroism, and sacrifice.  The remake is a pathetic immitation of this original, which did not need a remake, now or ever!  A must-see and a great addition to any DVD collection+dvd
If you really want to know something about the blues+N+Scorcese is not your guy. This review covers disk one only. Scorcese is a great director no doubt. He's also presented some fantastic clips from the period. But his understanding of the blues is so warped by the search for authentic African origins that you have to wonder whether he's ever read anything about the subject. An unintentionally hilarious classic of clueless romanticism. Reminded me of another Italian-American director's tribute to the cult of phony authenticity, the Corleone village scenes in Godfather I and II.+dvd
A lot of loose ends...+P+Up until today, I would have given this wonderful movie, which we watched in my Spanish class, 5+ stars.  But I did not at all like the ending; it very much ruined it for me.  I'm a person who needs closure.  Yes, this was a movie demonstrating a tragic topic and should be sad.  But that was just cruel, to end with the poor little girl singing about how she's so lost.  We don't know her fate.    I also felt that Roberto was a sort of villainized character.  He had a point about Gaby having to lose another mother.  I hope that Alicia, when she left, was going to get Gaby.  What I would like to know is what they decided to do with Sara, her possible grandmother.  Again, I need closure!  I was expecting a depressing ending, but not to be left hanging like this!  Arghhhhh.   I also had a problem with Gaby's having been born in captivity.  It makes that scene where the little boys suddenly burst into her room kind of pointless; it's meaningful, powerful, and was one of my favorite scenes untiL I realized she was just startled.  I guess it still has meaning, but, I dunno.  Just my being nitpicky, I guess.    I also want to know who Pedro was.  Also, what Gaby's possible parents did that got them arrested.  I realize that it could have been something very minor, but it would be nice to know.  For all I know they all could have been gun-toting revolutionaries.  Overall though, it was a wonderful movie and I am considering buying it myself.  I especially loved the scenes involving Las Madres y Abuelas de la Playa de Mayo.  And the acting was fantastic.  I just am bothered by all of these questions that are never answered+dvd
Am I hard of hearing?+N+The sound quality on the DVD was atrocious.  Too bad, given the great Burt Bacharach score+dvd
Character Study+P+Allen's September (1987) suffered from highly dismissive reviews which remains consistent with the public's view that Allen should produce comedies. Allen's willingness to risk, whether he fails or not, should be a clear invitation to consider this piece if just for the purpose of contrasting his present work with earlier films that defined him as a professional funny man.   The discerning viewer might enjoy this character study about six people if he or she wants a piece that demands a bit more reflection. As other reviewers wisely point out, Allen borrows from Chekov, particularly Uncle Vanya, in September and shows us how selfishness and thoughtlessness have their repercussions on innocent bystanders.   But the plot unfolds carefully as Lane (Mia Farrow) struggles to deal with unrequited love for a struggling writer (Sam Waterston)and an unwelcome guest in her mother (Elaine Stritch). I tend to favor the scenes which take place in candlelight. Lane's best friend, Stephanie, (Dianne Wiest) plays the piano as various characters reveal their fears and desires in carefully constructed monologues and dialogues. We learn a great deal about how professional concerns do not always eclipse the existential questions people face or the reality that people can go on living while harboring painful regrets.   Eventually, a particular truth surfaces which sends the characters reeling but Allen gives us a reprieve by offering an ending that is fair albeit unnerving.   Allen fans who enjoy his comdies should switch gears to view this film. Like his more sober films, September offers viewers the pleasure of character development as the fuel which moves the film forward.+dvd
OH MY GOD!!!!!+N+First of all this is the worst animation I've seen in my life!!! There like what 14-16 and they look like they have fake lips! Their hair is the worst!!! Overall.... HATED IT!!!+dvd
Mocking Greed and Arrogance+P+I don't put much significance on the social commentary of movies, but I enjoy this picture's insulting of human greed and pride.  And, it is hilarious while doing it.  It doesn't even take itself seriously.  I think it is very funny while targeting some of Humanity's worst characteristics+dvd
Laughter is what the "Magic" in this classic English farce+P+Is this movie perfect? Far from it, but this is part of its charm. None of the reviews I have read thus far have included the priceless, utterly hillarious scene enacted by the superb Sir Laurence Harvey performing the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy from Hamlet in front of a stodgy uppercrust theater audience while performing a STRIPTEASE! The final shot of his codpiece being tossed out into the audience is worth the price of the movie alone.        +dvd
Racist Movie - Worst Black Stereotyping I Have Ever Seen+N+This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!  This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.  This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. "But just how 'black' is he?," you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:  1. He talks different from the whites. ("Hey Bodee." "His name's Bodhi!" "Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine." Or something to that effect.)  2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)  3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)  4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)  I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.   The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.  This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.   Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. "Sphere of longiness"? Ech!  I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the "I love the 80's" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.  And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.  I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, "Prayer of the Rollerboys" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.  Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect+dvd
Why isnt there a new live DVD?+P+I have this DVD and it's a great deal. You get a brief on the road documentary of Avril on her first tour; you also get a complete performance from one of her concerts featuring all the songs on the first album (and then some). It's obvious to anyone objective that Avril's singing wasn't very good when she first came out. However, I recently caught a performance of her from Mad TV, singing my favorite song from her second CD. I have to say it was incredible. It's obvious that she has put the time in to her craft and is turning into a phenomenal artist. Given how phenomenal she is now, I dont understand why her record company hasnt released a new DVD...+dvd
Defective Copy+N+Swingtime is the one Astaire and Rogers musical which did not transfer to DVD.  The picture "freezes" at several points early in the film.

Enjoyable movie +P+to watch! Doris Day is so funny and good at her job. Too bad there isn't anyone else out there who could keep up with her these days. Typical boy chases girl movie and I love it when he catches her+dvd
All five stars for Caligula Reincarnated....+P+As a "kind of sewer" of these Italian sexplotation flicks, Capt. Freaky knows a good film when he sees one!  The first of this dual DVD, "White Slave" was not worth watching or mentioning for any reason.  Piss poor special effects of beheadings...no sex in the film whatsoever...and nothing to make anyone horny or subsequently enjoy themselves.  On the other hand, the second film, "Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler" was way better than what I expected.  Just the exceptional location of Northern Italy's lake district gives it one star.  Furthermore, the young blonde star of the film is gorgeous and someone both men and women would find attractive to sleep with.  There are some five star sexual violence scenes that are unfortunately too brief.  Beatings, whippings, gang raping of women prisoners, dipping naked women into vats of lime, hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats!  I mean, hey you "sicko" Nazi fans, is this something or what?  There are no actual hard core sex scenes, however, there are multiple simulated sex scenes that are quite hot to watch.  I think there is significant sexual tension in scenes throughout this very good storyline.  If you are into the whole "Nazi sex slave camp" thing....this is by far, the best of that genre I have come across.  And because I only paid $9.99 for this double feature...it makes it a 5 star film for me by all catagories.  I am curious if there is an unrated or extra cut film out there of this, as another reviewer hinted at?  If so, and they showed more actual sex, that would be the one to purchase+dvd
Not a family movie.+N+Despite the cute sounding description, this is not a family movie. The constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine. The idea of the movie was a good one but once again Hollywood messed it up. We were very disappointed and threw the video out.+dvd
Caveat emptor:  Buyer beware!!+N+I bought the Girls of Techno, Orig DVD, and I liked it.  Then I went to buy Girls of Techno Rave, adn Girls of Techno Hot Nights.  I was sorely disappointed, because both all 3 of them are same, with different covers.  I am planning to contact the Consumer Protection in Seattle and inform them of potential fraud by this company.  Great video, but to take advantage of customers is unbelievable!!  [...+dvd
Definitive Trilogy of Streisand's Three Romantic Wallows+P+This collection of three epochal films from Barbra Streisand's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker. All succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers.    The earliest is 1973's "The Way We Were", which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances. Veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents wrote a strong, multi-dimensional character for her in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.   In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles.  But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, "The Way We Were: A Look Back". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.   The second film is 1991's "The Prince of Tides". In only her second directorial effort (after "Yentl"), Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis. She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.   The movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. It is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay.   The movie is not without flaws. First, after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie's climax, the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein and a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Regardless, it's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.  The last movie is the weakest of the trio, 1996's "The Mirror Has Two Faces", still her last starring vehicle. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably. At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.   As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in "The Prince of Tides". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves. At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in "The Owl and the Pussycat") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role.  This is a worthy collection for any Streisand fan+dvd
A rotten musical+N+This film represents the low point in the splashy Grable musicals released by Twentieth Century Fox during the war.  The story/script is really appalling and Bruce Humberstone, a frequently poor director, adds nothing.  Grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer.  As far as plot, that is about it.  In typical Fox fashion, the colour and sound are excellent. Grable looks attractive but the makeup is quite heavy, particularly the bleached blonde hair.  She was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this. One would hope that Martha Raye and Joe E Brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting.   Most of the songs are lousy too - duds like "Don't Carry Tales".    Two redeeming feature - the song "Once too Often" as Hermes Pan and Grable perform a tame Apache dance and the title tune, nicely sung by Grable in close up.  The film represents Hollywood cynicism at its worst.  Fox built a film around Grable's status as THE pin up of World War 2 but neglected to give her a script or a decent leading man. Not to worry, the public will come anyway and, of course, so they did.  In the long run, though, junk like this chips away at the reputation of this appealing star who barely holds the film together by sheer star quality, her pretty face and her sense of humour.  If you are not an ardent Grable fan, you'll hate the film.        "Pin Up Girl" really supports the view that Betty Grable made poor films which don't warrant revival.  In fact many of them are first rate entertainments but certainly not this one!  It should, however, be noted that the print of the film in this DVD is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the Hidden Hollywood series+dvd
When things get hot, people get burned ... bet on it!+N+Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral &quot;I nearly got crushed in the crowd&quot;, and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies &quot; Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy&quot;. This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers+dvd
out of date+N+In it's prime this was probably a great opera and if you are interested in  the early culture of our country it is a must see. The opera  is difficult to follow and a guide would be helpful otherwise you just stumble through it.  Not much for entertainment.+dvd
so boring, it gets bored with itself+N+There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.  Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.  Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.  Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the "serial killer gene"?  Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.  Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague "suppressed rage" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.  So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.   Neither sleazy or highbrow, gritty or moralistic, Twisted is so boring, it gets bored with itself+dvd
since when did wesley and woody become lovers?+N+take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie+dvd
Blue+P+I don't know how familiar I can say I am with Krzystof Kieslowski. I've seen 2/3 of "The Decalogue" his ten-hour masterpiece and now I've seen the first film in his three colors trilogy "Blue." I think anyone who sees a film by Kieslowski will have a hard time disputing that he was one of the great directors. He's not credited as being one of the great directors, but he is credited as being a great director. Hopefully, in the years to come, his brilliance will become acknowledged. "Blue" is a strange film...It doesn't follow the typical rules of storytelling. It has a plot, but the images it uses play as big a part in telling the story as the plot does. Then there's the music. Rarely has the music been as important to a film as it is to "Blue." Juliette Binoche (who won a French Oscar for Best Actress for this role) plays Julie, a young woman whose husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident. Julie was in the car, but made it out alive. Once she heals up, she finds herself being badgered by friends and composers for her husband's last composition (her husband was a famous composer). The movie's turning point comes when Julie calls an old friend that she knows is in love with her. After they do their thing, she moves into an anonymous little apartment building in the hopes of escaping everyone she knows. She fears being hurt again and decides to have no friends, no acquaintances, and no family. Then, in a Kieslowski-like turn of events, she meets her husband's pregnant mistress. There are a lot of movies about people losing loved ones and trying to deal with it. In Kieslowski's hands, however, this formula seems fresh and new. There's no denying that Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzystof Piesiewicz understood the human condition and humans in general. None of the scenes in the film feel artificial or unneeded. Kieslowski doesn't waste time filling the screen with pointless scenes, but has it shaved down to the essentials. As I said, this film is very different. Unique would sum it up quite good. While I'd be lying if I said I understood the significance of this, there is something he does in the movie that I was quite fond of. In certain scenes, while Julie is talking usually, loud music will begin playing and the screen will fade to black. After a few moments, we fade back into exactly where we were. While I haven't seen the other films in the trilogy quite yet, I'm looking forward to them. Any fan of foreign cinema should see this film...If you haven't yet discovered Kieslowski, you need to.  GRADE: A+dvd
NOT the Original Version+N+This has already been expressed here in the reviews, but just as a reminder one more time..... this DVD is NOT the original version.  The original version has more material and is much better.  Hopefully someday they'll release an Unrated Version the way it was on VHS at one time.+dvd
Wut Up Cuz+P+This movie was so beautiful.  I watched it with my retarded daughter was immediately loved the character who was retarded.  she acted so good.  i couldnt believe how touching the end was with all the butterflies+dvd
damn yank+P+This could have been a 5 star movie because it is hard for me to follow the dialect without subtitles though the acting by the cast was what made up for this.  The cinematography is great and was sentimental seeing the coast of Cornwall.  I saw this movie primarily cause of Imogen Stubbs playing the part of a tomboy as being plausable because of a boyish figure like Hilary Swank, who is a hotty too.  I found Imogen attractive in other roles and was curious as to how i would see her.  Well it was amusing to watch the scenes where her cover could have been revealed whether or not she was fooling anyone i could not care cause she still looked fine as a woman to me.  One particular time was when an instructor was correcting her posture during fencing training at the military academy.  Later I enjoyed her swordsmanship in a duel that was surprisingly aggressive so that you would not mind having her around alot enjoying life. There is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that Imogen had part into that is worth noting+dvd
Major Payne has hurt my sides with laughter.+P+"Major Payne" is one of the funniest movies that I enjoy to watch over and over again. I thought that Damon Wayans delivered a knockout performance as the loud-mouthed, gold-toothed, trash talking, squeaky voiced Major Benson Winifred Payne. He was so funny that I nearly had a heart attack while laughing at the same time.  After a major drug bust goes extremely well in South America, Major Payne (Damon Wayans) returns to Parris Island, South Carolina and finds out that the U.S. Marine Corps is throwing him out of the military back into civilian life. After two weeks of civilian life, Payne is let back into the military under one condition: go to Virginia and train a group of delinquents for an ROTC program at Madison Academy. Payne regretfully accepts the job and puts each of the boys into 8 weeks of living hell! It becomes a fight because the boys do what they can to put Major Payne out of their lives!  I have so many favorites scene through out this movie but the one that shines the brightest is when Wayans had a dance sequence at a club where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. Many of the gags are side-splitting funny, and the vocal tones and mannerisms of Major Payne are just spot-on hilarious. And the kids in the film do a remarkable job in their supporting roles. The kids in fact steal the show (especially the younger ones). Lots of absurdity in the movie, but still here and there peeks through a poignant maturity on the deeper symbolism of what boot camp is all about  Of course, it is a feel good movie so you know everything will work out in the end. Base on some of the lower reviews you can see that this movie is not for everyone, but at the same time is worth seeing. If you don't like it by the time Payne does his "Failure to communicate!" line then maybe it isn't for you. As for me it's utterly brilliant.+dvd
A Classic 80's Movie+P+Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman star in this great movie from the 80's about a girl from the Valley and a guy from Hollywood.  Foreman stars as Julie, a valley girl who, along with her boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen) are the most popular couple at Valley High.  However, Julie is getting bored with Tommy because she thinks he's ignoring her.  So, she breaks up with him (on a mall escalator, no less).  After the break-up, Julie and her friends Samantha (Tina Theberge), Loryn (Elizabeth Daily), and Suzie (Michelle Meyrink) head to the beach.  It is here that Julie gets her first glimpse of Randy (Cage).  Unfortunately for Julie, she and her now ex-boyfriend Tommy are both supposed to go to a party at Suzie's house.  Randy's friend Fred overhears the plans for the party, and he and Randy plan to crash the party.  Sure enough, Fred and Randy show up uninvited at Suzie's house, but Julie is immediately intrigued by Randy.  The two start talking, but Tommy and his thug friends interfere and throw Randy out of the house.  Now very mad, Randy and Fred go back to the party.  Randy waits in the bathroom for Julie to come in, and the two decide to leave together.  Julie convinces Samantha to come along.  Randy takes Julie "over the hill' to Hollywood and shows her some of his favorite places to hang out.  The sparks soon begin to fly between Randy and Julie, and they start going steady, much to the disgust of Julie's friends.  Their relationship goes along very well for a while, but one night at a sleepover, Julie's friends tell her that she must make a choice between them and Randy.  They convince her to get back together with Tommy and dump Randy.   Julie goes along with it, and starts to be very mean to Randy, but does she really feel that way, or is she just covering up her true feelings for the sake of her friends?  Will Julie and Randy get back together, or will Julie do what her friends want her to?  This is a great movie.  I've seen it several times on VHS, and I was thrilled to find it on DVD. Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman are great in their roles as Julie and Randy.  The supporting actors are very good as well.  This movie was released when I was in high school, so it brings back a lot of memories for me.  The great 80s music played throughout the movie is a huge plus, too.    I give this movie my highest recommendation. The story is excellent, and the acting is very good.  Take a trip back to the 80s with this great movie.  "Its awesome"+dvd
oh God, why?!!!!+N+I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly+dvd
Not for Young Kids+N+I saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot.  I recently purchased the DVD thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids (9, 8, and 6) to watch.  Also, it was rated "PG" so I thought it would be pretty safe.  I was wrong.  While the plot is innocent enough, the language was atrocious.  I couldn't believe this thing was rated PG and not at least PG-13.  Be advised that if you don't want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie, then this is not for you+dvd
So Stupid, It's Funny+N+I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it.+dvd
Stick with the original+N+When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?  I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.  But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.  Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?  I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.  by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito+dvd
A Good Introduction To Stability Ball+P+Swiss ball basics is a 50 minute workout , there is only 10 exercises which are performed in 2 sets of about 10 reps , the instructor shows more advanced variations on the second set and does some stretches in between the sets. Though the exercises can be challenging , the workout is pretty slow paced and let you to concentrate in the exercises. The quality of this video is very good and it is filmed on a sanded area , the instruction is very good also and during the exercises there's some animated pointers. I think if youre in a good shape you'd be better off just buying his "swiss ball abs" it has most of the exercises from swiss ball basics but it has 3x20 minute workouts in different levels (but there all pretty tough). +dvd
Damme Good Action Movie!!!+P+THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF VAN DAMME'S TOP 3 MOVIES.  There is plenty of action and excitement that will make you want to watch it over and over again.  Natasha Henstridge is down right sexy and georgeous.  She played a perfect role in this movie.  The movie was well-acted and thought it deserved a 5 star.  This movie is a must-own on DVD.  The sound quality is great as well as the picture.  *Van Damme kicks plenty of..+dvd
Diabolical+N+What a terrible DVD. I'm no pessimist, this was recorded horribly. Either Shannon Hoon's voice is awful or the recording was. I suspect it was the latter. I will admit, I'm not a hardcore Blind Melon fan, but I'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al..and was very impressed. I read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the DVD. What a mistake. I also bought Alice in Chains Unplugged which is excellent. If you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this. Otherwise save your money.+dvd
Feel good+P+Waiting to exhale is a great movie, all star cast.  I is a movie, that draws you in and will leave you feeling good for the charaters and the story at the end+dvd
Blah Blah Blah @ The Critiquing Of This Movie+P+This is a great movie, will definately keep you laughing at the Diva's in this movie.  So what the movie is not as good and thorough as the book(what movie is?) I mean if you want ever detailed in a book put on screen then we will still be sitting in the movie theatre trying to see the end+dvd
disappointed+N+I was very disappointed in this video, Keb-Mo was good, but there was very little of him playing, actually there was very little playing by anyone. The interviews were fine, but you find yourself waiting for the music to start, and when it did, it didn't last.It is alright, not great by any  means, I would be hard pressed to buy it for more than a couple dollars+dvd
Not Another Teen Movie!!!+N+Milo Ventimiglia (Gilmore Girls, The Bedford Diaries) stars as Zack Harper, a kid who helps out his friend Kyle who is in a bit of a rut. Kyle was challenged by a senior to do the Dirty Deeds. The Dirty Deeds (there's 10 of them) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish. There's also a record that has never been beating before. So, Milo sets out to do the Dirty Deeds and there's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many Milo has done. Not Another Teen Movie!! Just had to say that but its bascially what it is. In American Pie you had Jason Biggs doing the pie and in this, well Milo Ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread (if you know what I mean). Milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie. More moronic characters. My advice is watch it (Unrated or not) once and the decisions are up to you. Also starring Lacey Chabert (Not Another Teen Movie, Mean Girls) of course, Mark Derwin (One Life To Live, Heist), Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean), Panso Gorson (South of Nowhere, Dear Wendy), Billy L. Sullivan (My Life, Little Big League), Ray Santiago (Meet The Fockers, Pinero), Todd Zeile (King of Queens, SNL), Michael Milhoan (American Gun, Pearl Harbor), Erin Torpey (Crescendo, One Life To Live), Arielle Kebbel (Aquamarine, Be Cool), Dave Power (Frailty, Boston Public) and Charles Durning (The Final Countdown, Rescue Me) for some odd reason that I dont know why. What does the Unrated version have to offer? Female Nudity what else?!+dvd
What could be more IRONIC than a deaf DJ?+P+Consumers love IRONY!  I can sum up this film in one sentence: DJing, drugs, hummus and sex...silence...newfound appreciation for life.  What makes this film great is not the fact that Frankie Wilde does drugs, rather, its HOW he does drugs (see it and you'll understand what I mean).  Same thing with his DJing.  The fact that he DJs is well-and-good, but you have to see HOW he DJs (pre- and post-deaf).  Frankie is a special character and Paul Kaye nails this role (as he says in the DVD extras, "God, I've waited a long time for this job.").  Speaking of DVD extras...WATCH THEM.  Frankie the spokesmodel for Oman Whiskey, Frankie on a cooking show, Frankie on an interview with a news anchor, Frankie's Rabbi (played by Paul Kaye), among other gimmicks...classic.  In regards to credentials...WINNER GEN ART FILM FESTIVAL, WINNER U.S. COMEDY ARTS FESTIVAL, WINNER TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL.  And the soundtrack...exceptional club music.  Particularly, Reflekt's "Need to Feel Loved" (Seb Fontaine & Jay P Remix).  I guarantee you will RE-WATCH this film over and over again.  Maybe you'll even take a step back and have a look at your own life?       Note: THIS FILM IS A WORK OF FICTION.  IT IS A "MOCK"UMENTARY.  DON'T BE FOOLED.  The fact that the directors and actors deliver such a compelling final product, where consumers actually believe it is real, is testament alone that this film is a keeper.  Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are. +dvd
DEAR GOD NO ....+N+I was a teen in the 1990's and I watched "MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000" and loved it because the films where so bad , they where good (funny) ... This peace of $#!t would have been right at home there !  Only watch if your :  HIGH  DRUNK   LOOKING FOR SOMETHING STUPID TO WATCH  OR ALL OF THE ABOVE .  THANK YOU+dvd
Manipulative trash+N+I'm disgusted by DePalma.  This is trash and so is he.  It is too manipulative and it is completely his fault.  He stretches out these horror scenes in the most manipulative way, as we watch Travolta fight his way through crowds to save the girl.  This kind of manure (self censorship) angers me.  This isn't art.  It's garbage.  His whole purpose is to manipulate us, to extend the horror scene in the most manipulative way.  Don't you see how phony it is?  Don't you resent how he is playing with your emotions?  You call this art?  You call this talent?  You call this good directing?  It's trash.  He stinks.  If he's trying to copy Hitchcock, he's not doing it right.  Why not show us Travolta swimming through sharks trying to save the girl.  I got it.  How about Travolta pushing kindergarten kids out of the way trying to save the girl from a four year old strangler.  And stretch the scene out, make it last through the whole milk and cookies period, as Travolta keeps pushing kids out of his way and the kids are merrily eating their Oreos and the girl is getting strangled.  Eeek.  That's a good scream.  DePalma, you stink.  What other stupid tricks can you do+dvd
Cliche ridden, "worst of kung fu" waste of time! +N+With all due respect to different tastes, I found Five Deadly Venoms lethally boring. I thought the dialog was trite and incoherent, the humor lame and predictable, the martial arts stunts and display average to bad. The plot lack subtlety, imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic, I could not finish this loser. Perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out, but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare.+dvd
A Wild & Creepy Sleeper ! +P+Stuart Gordons "DAGON" is a unique horror gem that belongs in every true horror fans collection! While not as well known as Re-Animator this film adaptation of another H.P.Lovecraft nightmare is one of the very best out there. This one is truly what nightmares are made of & I for one enjoyed the hell out of it. Excellent horror film!+dvd
The definitive reference for cross country skiing+P+This has got to be the best instructional skiing DVD or video that I have yet seen... and I have a shelf full of material.  I can tell you, this DVD will gather no dust.  It is now my definitive reference for the sport. It's exceptionally well organized. I have compared xczone.tv methods against other instructional videos and found theirs superior in every respect: quality of production, performance of skiers, clarity and correctness of description.+dvd
Bad+N+I've watched most of Segal's films, and I own several as well. But this film is one of the worst films I've seen in the last ten years. Excepting for a chance to look at Jacqueline Lord (a Catherine Zeta Jones look, act, and dress alike) for a little while, and her acting wasn't very good most of the time, there are no redeeming aspects to this film.  For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements.  The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film.  Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences.  Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.  Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.  I'd rather have seen a corny Kung Fu movie. At least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film.  Avoid this film totally+dvd
The beginning of Feature Documentary Filmmakin+P+This is a glimpse into an amazing way of life which, for the most part, no longer exists.  The Filmmaker was an explorer before he became a filmmaker, so great care is taken to tell these people's story, through the example of one main character: Nanook, the Bear.  I was pleased at how well this work has been preserved and transfered to the new medium of DVD.  If you are interested in the Arctic region, Anthropology, History, or even great Adventure, you will enjoy Nanook of the North+dvd
Mark Dacascos best overall movie to date!!!+P+Without a doubt this is Mark's most complete movie to date. The intricate plot, stylish flashbacks, and unique camera angels, makes this more than your average straight to video.  Tibor Tackas shows a very good touch. The  ending begs for a sequel, and I would pay money to see it in the theater if  one were to be made. This is the type of movie that Mark is able to show  the moves that have made him the envy of the action genre actors, and  object of desire from female fans, but he is also is allowed to actually  act and show depth. Tibor Tackus should be thanked for giving us more Mark  than I have seen in his previous movies to date, except for &quot;Only The  Strong&quot;, which I like equally as well as this+dvd
Not a good film+N+What else is there to say?  The acting is mediocre, the story line is nearly non-existent, and the only redeeming thing this film has to offer is the somewhat interesting cartoons superimposed upon the original score.  The vast disconnect between the book and the movie is at its most evident when the film ends, concluding with a quote from Phillip K. Dick that has virtually nothing to do with what you've just seen and makes you wish that it (the film) did+dvd
DEAR MORONS AT PARAMOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+N+My question for the Morons at Paramount is why do possibly glue the sticker seals the container with such strong stuff that you cannot avoid ruining the container when you remove it. May I remind that this a COLLETOR'S ITEM!!!!! Therefore if you damage it is WORTHLESS+dvd
Excellent+P+Continuing the high standard set by the quality of episodes from the third season, season 4 of Star Trek: The Next Generation maintains a high standard throughout. The conclusion of the previous season's cliff-hanger "The Best of Both Worlds" does not disappoint, it's the rollercoaster finish we were all hoping for. It doesn't end there though, the writers were brave enough to not have the next episode be "back to normal" as Star Trek is so good at doing but write a real character episode "Family" mainly dealing with Picard's trauma after being assimilated by the Borg. There aren't any terrible episodes this season, Qpid is a bit silly with the crew as Robin Hood characters - most of the stories are strong. "Future Imperfect" continues the brinkmanship between the Federation and the Romulans (with Andreas Katsulas of Babylon 5 fame and Riker telling Picard to "shut up"), "Data's day" is an entire episode from Data's perspective, "The Wounded" introduces us to the Cardassians, "First Contact" is what Star Trek's all about, then we get into "The Mind's Eye" and "Redemption" where the Romulan, Klingon and Federation triangle plot finally starts to come out. +dvd
For BB fans a strong 4; casual sports fans a 3.+P+Though some people consider Cobb the greatest, I don't recall ever seeing any name higher than Mr. Ruth in any book, on any list, with the exception of one book which places Willie Mays at the top. So with that statement, there should be many sports fans and historains who would want to check this movie/DVD out (though it's a little light on actual baseball *playing* - too bad, because the photography/camera work is terrific). Tommy Lee Jones plays the part as if he's auditioning for the part of Mephistofolies; or Sweeney Todd; it's surely "over the top" but he dominates every single scene he's in, actually over-running (with no sharpened spikes) Mr. Rhul, playing the (now) legendary sports writer Al Stump. In "real life", it seems Stump had to deal with a relatively tame but decidedly moody lion, in motel rooms, in banquet halls, in lounges, all over the place. The movie portrays a somewhat self-righteous writing genuis, as it constantly refers to his own personal troubles - the more he yells at his employer, who ultimately he does befriend, albeit cautiously, the more the very perceptive, though dying 72 year old man, reminds him of his own mess as a  filanderer and failed husband. There's a rather unconvincing scene towards the end of the picture, when at some motel Stump is presented with Divorce papers and he begins to fire Cobb's gun in the direction of this guy who's been chasing him around the country for this purpose. The script is very strong throughout but here the scene ends on a depressing note. What was needed was for Cobb to simply convey through his eyes "Wanna throw any more "stones" at *me*, son?" Well, maybe that's a bit trite, but the scene closes as Lee says that he saw nothing - just a coupla bad boys. Lolita Davidovitch has some good scenes, but her 1960 Vegas Cocktail Waitress has the look but not the "feel", meaning Shelton probably had to make her a milennium feminist to fit the quasi-political contemporary movie industry demands. Keeping the character more to the period would have worked. Another concession to the male-female spirit of today, not 1960, is in a deleted scene: Stump watches, through his office window, and in the company of his Secretary, a shapely lady ascend a staircase. In the midst of his confusion and disorientation, he tells his exasperated co-worker to tell his wife, who has just called, well, tell her something. I wonder what the "real" Al Stump thought of that kind of stuff. Tyrus Raymond Cobb surely fought death...and life. In his profession, he reached high, refusing to be taken lightly or be beaten. As his violent world finally came crashing in, and his health was in free-fall, he still refused to acknowledge his vulnerability, his mortality. Maybe that's the only real lesson to be learned by all of this: even a wicked man can sustain by calling up his reserve of strength and courage; maybe even artfulness.  Mr. Shelton delivers a very interesting narrative of the back story,  though he sounds very subdued - perhaps the memory that the kind of numbers the Georgia Peach drew out to the old ball park did not exactly compare to this movie about his last days+dvd
Crazy Talent!!!!+P+I've watched this video many times and I never tire of hearing and seeing the beats these men and women make with common, everyday items.  I have used it in my PE class and I have friends who have used it in music/band.  It is a great classroom resource as well as an entertaining work of art. +dvd
Beautiful and Unique, but oddly frustrating+N+Dancing on Dangerous Ground is best described as a ballet expressed through the medium of Irish dance. The costuming is modern and the acts form a very cohesive story (much more so than Riverdance), but the superposition of romance, tragedy, and war on a dance invented for celebration seems...contradictory at best.   The performance is technically excellent, and for some, the military scenes alone will make the DVD worth it. But the Irish Legend - a tale of a first officer and a queen who betray their king not unlike Lancelot and Guinevere - has Griana truncating her forms so as not to bounce too much during her lament, and both leads trying to express longing without breaking Irish posture during their romance. In that sense, watching Dancing on Dangerous Ground is kind of like admiring a painting of the sunset over a tropical beach done in glorious black and white. Even if you think black and white photography is beautiful, and love sunsets and the tropics, you end up wishing that the painter had chosen to change either the subject, or the medium.   The one place where medium and subject DO work well is in the military scenes, where Irish precision is put to amazing use; then the watcher can feel the rhythm and the power conveyed, even through the TV screen. But in the scenes in between, I found myself craving a no-hold-barred energetic number that expressed the joy of Irish dance (like the ones which made Riverdance famous), and wishing for the full upper-body expression of a ballet during some oddly stilted during laments and romantic scenes.   As an Irish dance piece it's well executed, and as a ballet the costuming is inventive and the music beautiful, but there's an odd quality to watching it. Sometimes it gives the impression of muted color, sometimes of undersold majesty, but always there's the feel that the passion, while *almost* there, is somehow still missing. +dvd
You've Got To Be Kidding+N+After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.    One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue.  It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.  It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG.  You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens.  The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz.  No wonder it died financially and never reached the States+dvd
Waiting for response from seller+N+When I received this set it contained no Disk #2 and 2 Disk #5s. I have e-mailed the seller to see if they will rectify the situation and I'm waiting for their response+dvd
Pre Pre Pre Pre+P+Great inspirational movie.  I was very surprised that my 16 YO son also liked it.  Really good movie for anyone with children that participate in sports.  A pleasure for adults too as it is an excellent story about how with focus, discipline and perserverance, you CAN reach your goals+dvd
Kiss my Assassin!+N+Alright, let's do this one up on the bounce and by the numbers:   1) Bridget Fonda is red-smoking hot. Fire-breathing dragon hot. Albeit in an angular, toothy kind of wait, which, don't get me wrong, is just fine.   2) Bridget Fonda plays Maggie, who, with some Pantera-lovin' buds break into a pharmacy to get a little Better Living Through Pharmacology, unleash a little jihad on the owner, and get themselves into a firefight.   Everybody gets riddled with bullets, except Maggie, who, in the wretched bowels of withdrawal and all-twitchy-like, greases a cop.   3) Note: did I mention that "Point of No Return" is a big-studio remake of Luc Besson's utterly insane, bump-n-grind brutal, deliciously bleak and nihilistic "Nikita"? I did not? Shoot me. No, no, put down that Steyr sniper rifle, I'm kidding there Cowboy, sheesh...  4) With that in mind, all you need to know is this: studio director John Badham (who directed, ummm, the cinematic marvels "Bird on a Wire" and "Short Circuit", which proves he's a real, er, edgy dude) churned out what amounts to a shot-for-shot remake of "Nikita". Only it's like the carbon dioxide remake of "Nikita": odorless, colorless, and tasteless.  5)Alright: so Maggie gets hauled into a supermax facility, deep-sixed by the Government, manhandled a little too much by Super-Duper-Secret Agent Bob (Gabriel Byrne, starting his slow slide from sneering, edgy brilliance into avuncular B-movie actor Hell), erased from the Big Book of Life and super-shuttled down a little Orwellian "memory-hole", and offered a choice: Society made you, baby. Now we'll give you your Murder 101 Training, and you can be a sanctioned killer.   6) That's about it. It's basically "Nikita", without the hip and happening and totally ominous techno-score, without Luc Besson's surreally grim edginess and sublime cinematography, with New Orleans dubbing for Nice (without even the fun of a Hurricane, or a shoot-out at the Superdome, which might have enlivened this turd). It's like "Nikita" with all the fun and style and gratuitous killing bled out.   7) That said, Fonda looks good writhing around on a bed in her Hello Kitty panties.   8) Oh, and Harvey Keitel shows up in an Enzo Ferrari, I think, though I was way too liquored up by then to care. Do you care? He's channeling The Terminator by way of a tax accountant, and was way too goofy to live.   9) The original "Nikita" showed me something I'd never seen before: an Indonesian diplomat literally getting flushed down a toilet. This one showed me something I've seen many times: an edgy, nasty, grimy, kinetic foreign flick getting flushed down the remake toilet.   Terminate with Extreme Prejudice.   JS+dvd
Why did I buy this trash?+N+Poltegeist is the worst DVD set that I ever purchased. The plots are the most ridiculous and amateurish that I have ever encountered. Characters have no clear delineation, they hover over any terrain that the writers hoist on them. Contradictions and sheer lunacy are admitted into the script if the story demands it. Characters who are sceptical one minute, suddenly swing wildly into occult belief full of knowledge of mystical arcana. The actors try to make this schmaltz work, however, at times their faces, confused at the blatant absurdity of the script, collapse into pseudo profound baffoonery. Ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you cannot even expel didainful laughter. This show is not even a "turkey" because the sheer stupidity of the script elicits revulsion of such a sharp quality that you can only dream of smashing the DVD's with a hammer to eleviate the loathing that overwhelms your mind while wasting your life watching this dross. This show is so awful, I couldn't give it away as a present for the justified fear that the recipient would promptly end our dear friendship due to the insult of unloading this manure to their dwelling. Ugh! Avoid this show like the pox. +dvd
Only in a Very Dry Desert+N+This movie has some excellent acting, starting with the always wonderful Michael Caine, and some very funny moments, but it lacks one important ingredient: a script.  The story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates. Worth watching if you are an inveterate Caine fan or feel nostalgic about that Caribbean island you visited.+dvd
A poor rehash+N+I've seen these scenes in so many different movies that I got bored and  turned it off. It was just a poor copy of other good movies. (Like 633 squadron)+dvd
Great DVD of a Poor Movie+N+CONCERNING THE DVD:  Yet another MGM quickie, containing the film in its correct 1.66:1 aspect ratio with some nicely restored video elements.  The footage from other films that was edited in looks poor. The 2.0 Mono soundtrack is in good shape. There are basic subtitles in French and Spanish, scene selections as well as a beat-up trailer.   CONCERNING THE FILM: (from my website, www.angelfire.com/film/eurowar)  The always-overrated David McCallum is one of the few good things in this low-budget World War II adventure piece, yet another quickie from Oakmont Films.   Sometime prior to D-Day - probably early '44 or '43 - a Mosquito Squadron is sent to bomb a V-1 rocket installation in France, when Squadron Leader Scott (David Buck) is shot down and presumed dead. His second-in-command, Quint Munroe (who just happens to be like a life-long brother to him) has to return to England and tell his beautiful blonde wife (Suzanne Neve) the sad news. As one would expect, Munroe and Mrs. Scott slowly fall in love. But when Munroe is chosen to lead a mission to bomb a new V-3 development center, things will chance quite a bit - because Scott is a prisoner held at the target fortress!   From start to finish, "Mosquito Squadron" is a total hack-job - literally. The story is filled with enough contrivances and clichés to drive any mildly serious critic mad. Let us take a brief look at a 1964 film entitled "633 Squadron". In said film, a squadron commander has a best friend shot down over Norway, and falls in love with his sister. Later on, he is assigned to bomb the fortress where his friend is being held. Sound familiar? And that's not all our title film steals! Virtually all of the aerial battle footage is directly lifted from "633 Squadron", while the new footage is comprised almost entirely of horrible-looking miniatures hanging from far-too-visible wires.   The writers have also directly copied another classic war film, "The Dam Busters". The feasibility of Munroe's mission revolves around a bouncing bomb, which will skip along the ground and roll into an open tunnel leading to the V-3 rockets. (I won't even mention how convenient it was to leave a big open tunnel to drop a bomb into). The real bouncing bomb (made famous in 1954's "The Dam Busters") was designed to skip on water to destroy Nazi dams - not the ground as is seen here! The idea of dropping a bouncing bomb on the ground is, simply, ludicrous and impossible. Introduction of this concept kills the storyline immediately.   The low budget shows up in every action sequence: the French resistance force is comprised of a half-dozen men in berets carrying Sten guns, and only a handful of German guards enforce security at the "fortress". The forests are obviously cheaply furnished soundstages, and a face-off with an imitation German "tank" is ludicrously shot. We never really see much of the German-held Chateau, and when we do it never looks as though we're inside some high-tech development center a la "Operation Crossbow". The scenes set in England fare somewhat better, with some excellent scenes set at airfields and a rather rowdy officer's club.   David McCallum and the cast of little-known English actors do a fair job, even though the no-frills script doesn't give them much to do. McCallum is a fair actor, nowhere near as great as his fans hail him to be, though. He was better suited for television than cinema, and that comes out in every scene. He often looks uncomfortable and awkward, but delivers his often banal dialog convincingly and with conviction. His scenes with Neve are often touching, even though audiences have seen this dozens of times before. There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble, besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film "Diamonds are Forever" a few years later.   Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s: "Attack on the Iron Coast", "Hell Boats", "The Last Escape" and "The One Thousand Plane Raid" among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release, but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here - or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter - is in for a big disappointment. Check out "633 Squadron" instead. +dvd
Boiler Room May Boil Your Nerves+P+Some folks might rent or buy this DVD for its well known names, but Vin Disel and Ben Afflec play very small roles  It is Giovanni Ribsi that shines.  He plays a young college drop out, who turns to an in-house, illegal gambling den to help him release his inner rage and built up anxieties towards his demanding father.    (SPOILERS) But it is his discovery of a Boiler Room operation hawking non-existent stocks and bonds for non-existent companies that really steers this movie.  Fantastic interactions between the main character, and Vin Disel character.  I appreciated the relationship beteen Giovanni and the secretary character, but I felt it was under-developed and weak.  Could have been left out, or developed better.  I saw this one in the theater, and now own on DVD, and would recommend it to any Pre-MBA student, or Wall Street wannabe. It is great training.  MC White said: Check it out!+dvd
The Mime, The Actor, The Criminal, the Aristocrat, and Their Love+P+"Children of Paradise" is set in pre 1840 Paris, on Boulevard of Crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic. It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-François Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).   Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph. It is a 190 minutes long film but I cherished every minute of it.  +dvd
music maker's magic+P+Pick up most any hit record beginning in the late 1940s, especially any recording done with Atlantic Records, and you will likely see that one Tom Dowd was the producer or recording engineer. In this loving tribute to Dowd, who died October 27, 2002 before the film was finished, those inside the guild honor the memory of one whom they universally acknowledge was a legendary genius and wonderful human being. In his younger years Dowd was a physics student at Columbia, and even worked on the atom bomb project (he was present at the Bikini Atoll tests), but his mother was an opera singer and perhaps he was destined for music. Dowd was a master technical innovator, musical aesthete, coach, father figure, and psychologist. He himself narrates most of the film, but we are also treated to original concert footage (Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, etc.) and retrospective interviews with a number of the stars whose sounds he perfected, including Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, and Greg Allman. The five minutes or so when Dowd sits at a console and walks us through the thirty-year-old master copy of "Layla," starting with only the guitars and then adding the various parts until they pulse with that incredibly evocative sound that defined an era, interspersed with poignant reflections by Clapton, are worth the entire film. One disappoint in this otherwise fascinating glimpse of the history of music recording since the late 1940s is that we learn nothing at all personal about Dowd, and nothing at all about any weaknesses, failures, misjudgments, and the like, that would have made this entirely likable person even more richly human+dvd
Death of a Dynasty+P+I thought this movie was hilarious, and was not expensive at all+dvd
ONE OF THE WORST I EVERY PUCHASED+N+VERY DULL MOVIE! UNINTERESTING CHARACTERS IN A PLOTLESS MUCK OF INCIPID POLITICAL PROPAGANDISTIC DRIVEL. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  +dvd
Unjustly overlooked.+P+Lord of War (Andrew Niccol, 2005)  This one flew under the radar, or at least as under the radar as a much-hyped major Hollywood production can. Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.  Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.  As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators. It's good stuff; you probably didn't see it in the theater (very few did), but you can catch what you missed then on DVD now. ***+dvd
Really Old Really Fast+N+For some reason, I fell into the trap of believing a dvd that consists of all of Eminem's music videos would be really cool. It really isn't.  In fact, I have only watched this dvd once.  The music videos are great, but how many times do you really think you are going to watch them.  The extras are definetely not worth the purchase.  Once again, how many times are you going to watch The Making of Stan.  The extra that mocks the Blair Witch Project is also just really really bad.  Overall, don't buy this.  Download the music videos and spend your money elsewhere.  Actually, go use it to see 8 Mile+dvd
Classics+P+All the classics are on this DVD.  You wouldn't think Dr. Seuss would be bad for young children since the books are great for first time readers but my son starting pointing aggressively and saying "NO" and "OUT" just like the fish does to the Cat in the Hat when we would ask him not to do something.  There is always at least one character that is angry. +dvd
Finally on DVD+P+I saw this movie many years ago and have been waiting for it to come to DVD.  This story is especially relevant today, as the country hears more and more about terrorist cells within our midst.  It was interesting to see how an everyday Joe trains (Hollywood style) to become an assassin and to follow the action as he avenges his sweetheart's death+dvd
Wild West...say hello to film noir!+P+As other reviewers have already mentioned , this underated classic is a brilliant combination of film noir & the Wild West. The photography is simply amazing. The flashbacks, dreamlike sequences, & one particularly memorable scene in which Mitchum's stepbrother is seen in the background slowly stalking Mitchum while planning to shoot him are what make this an incredible western. Robert Mitchum plays Jeb Rand, the lone Rand family survivor after a bloody feud. Rescued & raised by Ma Callum (Judith Anderson) he grows up with her two kids: Thor (Teresa Wright) & Adam (John Rodney). Jeb gets along with Thor just great, so great that they fall in love! This doesn't sit well with Adam who never accepts Jeb as a part of the family. Their rivalry only worsens as they grow older, eventually leading to tragic results which tear the family apart. Mitchum commands the screen so well with his amazing performance that he makes acting look easy. This is easily his best western & one of his greatest roles of his career. The chemestry between him & Teresa Wright is one of the best things about this classic. Add Max Steiner's music & you've got one awesome film! And let's not forget the underated Alan Hale, who has a small but memorable supporting role as a friend of Jeb's. Considered as the first psychological western, this is an unforgettable gem that you need to add to your dvd collection+dvd
Wrecked movie!+N+Why oh why is this in pan and scan only. This is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this DVD. About half the movie is missing. I love Joshua Tree but I won't buy this DVD. Artisan must understand this simply won't do. Sadly, the only widescreen version out there is the Japanese Laserdisc. And that's LONG out of print+dvd
Take on "10"+P+My take is that this is Dudley's best movie, better than both "Authurs". While funny, risque and cute for the collective conscious of the late '70s, the scene sequences appear rather hackneyed and pale in the 2000s. The plot is mediocre. The greatness of the movie lay in Dudley Moores registration of wit shown by his mercurical, elegant and moving use of facial expressions and repartee with Brian Denehey at the bar and especially at the piano, revealing both great depth of feeling and consumate artistry as a musician. This piano scene, alone reason for 5 stars, was the saving grace. +dvd
Extremely Satisfied+P+To put it simply, if you're a Star Trek fan you'll like this season. If you're not, you'll probably find that some of the episodes are weak on plot or character interaction. However, there are some gems hidden among the these episodes. The Klingon sub-plot gets its starting point here and the season finale is legendary in NextGen canon. Season 3 really begins to reveal what NextGen was really all about. All in all much better than Seasons 1 and 2+dvd
I liked this movie..+P+I love the fact that it isn't shallow and hits some tough topics. Cameron Diaz shines along with Toni Collette! Shirley Maclaine makes the second half of this movie extremely funny+dvd
Highlights Only+N+Misleading title, I was attempting to locate the entire games not just the highlights.+dvd
A Very Powerful Treatment of Popularity viz a viz Discipline in the Military+P+In an interview Sir Alec Guinness was asked how difficult it was for him to portray an individual whom he in actual life was the opposite to, Sir Alec responded as all great actors would, by saying that he  felt it to be challenging, but enjoyed it once he got into it... and this is the Alec Guinness that one sees in Tunes of Glory. The tale of friction between two powerful figures, both with huge egos and both unwilling to bend to the circumstances of reality and their times. The ending of the movie has always broken me up and brought me to tears.  for just as in the movie... "all my sons".. the  Major (Guiness) felt an afffinity and a kinship to all the men under him, growing to love them as (..."all my babies"...) he would his own sons.. there lies the irony in the ending... and his ultimate feelings for Col. Barrow (John Mills).....enuff sai+dvd
Pretentious+N+Biggest piece of pretentious (...) I've seen in a long long time!!!  It's all very autobiographical about this really "cool" and "talented" actress Anna Battista who is adored by her public and so wants to get into directing. Daria Nicolodi plays Anna's mother. (Who else?) And Asia is shown as nude as can be involved in a handful of sex scenes that are at times bordering on the harder side of softcore (all of course in the interest of "honesty"). And that's about the only good thing that can be said about the movie.  The film just screams "Me! Me! Me!" Pity that not everyone who is director, writer and actor in one is automatically an Orson Welles. Prior to the start we even have a clip of Asia advising us that we probably heard already how bad the film is, but that it REALLY is very good (shouldn't that be up to the viewer to decide???) and that it had saved her life blah blah.  This movie has - hands on stomach - some of most pathetic and amateurish performances I have seen in quite some time. It so wants to be arty, hip and experimental and is even shot in three different languages: English, Italian and French. I would have actually preferred if the English parts had also been subtitled as I really haven't got a clue what Ms Argento was mumbling most of the time. In actual fact this ended up being the first DVD where I completely gave up on following the director's commentary: I had to really crank up the sound on it, and still found it hard to hear what she had to say (contentwise: very little anyway). For someone who is supposed to be such an expressive actress, Asia simply has the most boring, dull and expressionless voice I have ever heard recorded.   I was never the biggest Asia Argento fan, but after watching this flick my respect for her dropped to new lows. This lady has one of the biggest Egos in the biz, with unfortunately very little talent or trace of humour to boost and is an utter moron full of pseudo-intellectual pretensions.+dvd
Bad+N+This movie is just plain bad.  It never should have been released for public consumption.  I honestly cannot think of one good thing to say about this movie.  It makes no sense that it would have 3 1/2 stars with 39 reviews.  Something fishy is going on here.  Enough time wasted on this one+dvd
Poorly extended 60's film project+P+Tragic" is a word that may become synonymous with the name of Edie Sedgwick.   The 5 stars are for Edie's smile, and nothing more.   This "Let's Start", and then "Stop", "Start again" cycle of this film presents as a messy, disorganized glance at Ms. Sedgwick's disturbing life.   Another 'tragedy " exists here. Our educated culture should recognize that if Edie weren't exceptionally beautiful, there wouldn't have been much fuss over an ancestor of a historically noted family.   Beauty still takes precedence over most other attributes.  It's been over 35 years since the death of Edie Sedgwick, but the "glam-famishished" still won't let the beauty get her rest.   The film's black and white scenes show the brilliance of Edie's past beauty, but are all cut and pasted into a confusing,tangled decoupage.   The additional color footage of the next decade is woven in carelessly.  If it was just Edie's glowing wedding sequence that were included,it would've been much easier to watch.    The "two teenagers" who appear in the  the colored segments seem out of time with Edie's Glory Days of the 60's.     This is NOT  a spiraling Masterpiece.Not a work of art nor imagination galore.     Just commercial trash for the star struck. For other than commercial purposes, it is a film that Spotlights it's own defeat.             +dvd
Hey Pinocchio, your nose is growing!+P+One of the best performances Jim Carrey has given. A very good concept for a film. Funny, refreshing, original and very well done. I felt it could have been a lot better with a little less comedy and a little more drama to get the point across better but still a must see for any Jim Carrey fan. Great acting, casting, screenplay and filming. I recommend it+dvd
SEEN IT, OWN IT,  LOVE IT+P+I have been a huge fan of Judy Garland's for years and this is one of my favorite movies of hers.  Even though she doesn't sing in it,  it won't matter,  you will see her as an actress, which was what she wanted to be, not just a voice.  It is subtle in the love story and story itself.  Boy meets girl,  boy takes girl out to deliver milk,  boy loses girl,  boy finds girl, boy marries girl and boy leaves for war.  Vincente Minnelli was the perfect choice for directing this, he uses New York as a character that works against them,  but Boy and Girl make it through and marry.  It is a lovely love story.  Robert Walker is very sweet in it too.  Also Judy has a crying jag in almost every one of movies,  and this is the best/saddest crying scene.  Also look for Roger Edens (her mentor) playing the piano in the restraunt scene.  It is a must for all Judy Garland fans and those who love a good love story+dvd
Great Beginner DVD+P+I really enjoyed this DVD. Great moves, beautiful scenes. It relaxed me just watching it. I like the variety of workouts, some easy and some a bit more challenging. Something for everyone. I started this because I had a tweek in my back, and after a few weeks I feel much better.  I'm ordering other products from this instructor. Highly recommended+dvd
best Hitchcock movie+P+Of all the movies that Hitchcock directed this is the best one.  The plot is captivating, the casting superb but the directing is unique. You actually think that you are part of the set and feel the mercury rising. A masterpiec+dvd
The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition)+P+I am very happy with my purchase.  For over 25 years I have been wondering how this series ended.  I never saw the entire series just a few episodes.  It is a good show and I would recommend it+dvd
2 Star Dud+N+After a man is caught cheating in a poker game a lynch party is formed and the man is murdered.  Soon after the murderers begin dying violent and mysterious deaths.   Dean Martin plays a ramblin' gambler in FIVE CARD STUD, a movie that probably didn't, but certainly could have, pounded the fatal nail into the traditional western before handing the franchise over to the Italians.  Although it sells itself as a mystery/western - who's killing all these gambling varmints, anyhow? - a five-second study of the movie's poster will pretty much shuffle out who's the good guy, who's the bad guy, and who's going to ride into the sunset with Inger Stevens.     I watched this movie the first time years and years ago, back in the knee-britches days.  It's possible some of synapses fired and connected and I somehow, after a generation plus, remembered how the plot - and I use that term loosely - ran.  I doubt it, though.  FIVE CARD STUD doesn't bother itself with keeping an edge to the mystery.  Robert Mitchum plays a gun-toting preacher who opens a church soon after the lynching occurs, Roddy McDowell is an angry young man with a chip on his shoulder.  Katherine Justice plays the shapely tomboy sister of McDowell and Inger Stevens is wasted, again, as a hair-cutting floozie.  Both women, of course, have lips puckered for the six-shootin' gambling man Martin.   This one was pretty excruciating, and it's really tempting to blame it all on the bored, and boring, Martin.  That's probably not fair, though.  The script is murky, the dialogue laughable (at the wrong times,) and, like I said, the mystery is never all that much of a mystery.  Martin, like Mitchum, was best in movies that let him play it laid-back and coolly bemused.  He needs manic energy to react to - think Shirley MacLaine, a young Sally Fields, or even Jerry Lewis.  He doesn't have the chops to carry a movie without someone like that, though.  Mitchum could, but the movie doesn't put him at the center.  It wouldn't matter anyway, because the only hope for this trite oater would be razing the story and starting over.  About the only fun this one provides - besides a scene with Mitchum and Yaphet Kotto near the end - is trying to decide who looks more bored, Martin or Mitchum.  My money's on Mitchum, but Martin gives him a go at it.  A waste of a good cast, and, save for a scene or two, a waste of a viewer's time.+dvd
Just about what I expected, only more boring...+N+I'm sorry, I love Gina Gershon and I was looking forward to watching this movie since I do like action films. But this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick. I wasn't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show.  The basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an Aryan militia becomes prominent nearby. It starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate, and the white boys in the militia don't like that. *gasp, I never would have guessed*  Main character kicks everyone's behind, gets the girl, acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any B flick action film.   Your time could be better spent watching paint dry. Or if you're desperate for something like this then watch Universal Soldier, at least it was funny+dvd
Gore and Humor at the Opera.+P+Dario Argento's Terror at the Opera is simply about a psychotic hooded killer who terrorizes an opera diva whom he adores. The opera diva is Betty, a young singer who gets a chance to star in Macbeth when the original lead has an accident and breaks her leg. Her powerful (not) performances in Macbeth attracts the killer who randomly kidnaps Betty, ties her up and tapes a row of sharp pins under her eyes forcing her to watch him commit murder. Later on in the film we find out why he does this to her aswell as the killers secret identity. Terror at the Opera is more of a slasher rather than a horror, (as there is no real scary moments in the entire film) but still a good horror.  TATO is a very enjoyable horror/slasher. For the usual horror fanatic, it does deliver as it is gory and strangely at times very humorous. The camera work is great in this film as it exaggerates the gore by simply zooming in on a penetration of a knife or when the camera becomes the eyes of Betty, showing us what she sees through those sharp needles taped under her eyes. Apart from gore, TATO also has a mystery factor. As the film progresses introducing new characters and reminding us of old suspicious characters, the viewer soon begins to wonder who is the killer. And of course this does lead to a twist at the end.  With plenty of violence, mystery, thrills and humor, Dario Argento's well paced feature will not dissapoint. One bad thing I can say about this film is that the acting is quite bad, but that maybe the result of the terrible dubbing. However, Terror at the Opera is still an entertaining film and well worth a look+dvd
Very Very Good movie+P+This film is A VERY good one..it has mystery,horror,style good acting. The crows annoyed me to bits but that was part and parcel of what made the film so creapy. The camera work is second to none and i believe is ahead of it's time;how they found the killer is beyond me but even that was a good stroke. The lead actress was a bit over the top with the noise she made and she to me failed to cut it as the opera singer type and she looked stilted while performng the opera scenes but she was nice in her role.   Filled with twists and turns it's ending rivals any i've seen for drama .  This is highly recommended by me..highly.   The score is just awesome+dvd
One of the best movies ever made, one of the best DVDs ever made.+P+"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the best films ever made and Fox has recently released a fitting two disc DVD edition of the film. Fitting because the DVD is one of the best I have ever seen.  Directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the God of screenwriters, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross. How could a film with this pedigree be anything but good?  What you may not realize, or know, is that this film made Robert Redford the star he is today. Paul Newman, already an established star having appeared in "Hud", "Cool Hand Luke" and "The Hustler", among others, was a bankable star and the film was made because he agreed to make it. Initially, he wanted to play the Sundance Kid, but eventually settled on the role of Cassidy. Robert Redford was not new to film, but he was nowhere near the icon he would become. He had some early success which was followed by a few clunkers. The pair became a match made in heaven and would go on to appear in more films together. On screen, they appear to be friends, much like their characters, and this adds to the charm of their relationship.  Redford clearly recognizes the influence this film had on his career. His famous film academy and film festival are named after his character in the film.  Butch and Sundance decide to rob the mail car of a train owned by a powerful rail baron. Butch is tired of the work and wants to retire, but he needs one or two big scores to set him up. After blowing up the rail car, they run off with the loot and hide out in a small town, at a brothel they frequent. Meeting up with the rest of their gang, they quell a revolt and decide to do one more job. They will rob the same mail car on the same railway, on its next run through the area. It is the perfect crime, no one would suspect the same train being robbed, so it will probably be loaded with money. After blowing up the car for a second time, they notice another locomotive speeding towards them and a crew of men on horseback alight from the car and give chase, chasing Butch and Sundance, and their two accomplices, for days, across many terrains. Finally, they realize the rail baron has hired a famous Indian tracker to help a band of men, including a former sheriff who is now a famous bounty hunter, catch the duo. After the chase, they return to the home of Ella (Katharine Ross), the Sundance Kid's girlfriend. Tired, they decide to leave the country and travel to Bolivia and begin robbing banks there.  As I watched this DVD of "Butch Cassidy", two things quickly became apparent. This film is virtually timeless. With the lone exception of the song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head", the film could've been made yesterday, the images are so clear. The second is that the DVD print is one of the most beautiful transfers I have ever watched. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (who would later work on "American Beauty" among others) is simply stunning and brings out all of the rich detail of the landscape. Everything is crisp and clear, when it is supposed to be, colors are bright and vivid, it's just beautiful to watch. It doesn't hurt that the stars are two of the most handsome men to ever appear in film, at the prime of their careers, and one of the most beautiful women to ever co-star. How did anyone get past all of that eye candy?  The key to becoming fully invested in this film is William Goldman's screenplay. He introduces the characters in action, we learn as we go, and they are almost always moving, or doing something. Goldman fills their mouths with witty dialogue, showing us how their relationship works, and they are instantly likeable to us. This is basically a love triangle with Ross' Ella playing the go-between. The two men have a very close friendship, enjoying each other's company. But Cassidy loves Ella as well, even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend is the recipient of this woman's love, so they get along. Then, there is the famous chase. The railway baron's men chase Butch and Sundance for days, taking up a significant chunk of the film. But this scene proves to us how committed the two men are to each other and makes their future trek to Bolivia all the more believable. We have to believe there is a real threat and these men never let up on the chase, if they catch Butch and Sundance, they will be killed. As soon as they reach Bolivia, Goldman has a lot of fun with the characters again, exploring their relationships, rebuilding them in a way, and making them light hearted again. It is almost amazing to watch this film because if a studio executive were presented with the same screenplay today, it would probably not be made. It doesn't hit plot points at pre-determined pages, it tells an unconventional story, and we never actually see the villains. Goldman had the luxury of writing this film during a period in which studios were still able to work with somewhat unconventional screenplays. Of course, they wanted to make money as well, but they still considered film an art form.  George Roy Hill is an underappreciated director. I think a large part of this is because many of his films are very humorous. Comedy is not as highly respected in Hollywood as drama, even though making a good comedy is much more difficult. So I suspect the humorous elements of most of his films made him less respected in Hollywood, but when your films are as good as "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "The Sting", you deserve some respect. He made his share of duds, but when he passed away a few years ago, Hollywood was robbed of a talent ready to make at least a few more classics.  During this period, big screen Westerns were becoming unpopular. Perhaps the dearth of television westerns was keeping the public out of the theaters, but this genre was considered risky at the time. Recent films starring Burt Lancaster and others were failing to light the box office fire. The second disc contains a new "Making of" feature including interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, former studio executives David Brown and Richard Zanuck and more. Zanuck reveals that he took a real chance in greenlighting this film, but fought for it all the way. He also haggled with Hill and the filmmakers, in an attempt to keep the budget under control; he became concerned when the film was projected to cost about $7.5 million (consider the average studio film now costs at least $125 million). But the film would go on to be a big hit. Such a huge hit the filmmakers followed this with the equally popular "The Sting".  The second DVD also contains some archival interviews with the stars, some trailers and more.  In the "Making Of" documentary, they discuss the inclusion of the song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". People fought against it but Hill and composer Burt Bacharach felt it would be the perfect accompaniment to the scene of Butch and Ella riding a new-fangled bike through her barn yard. It does work, but it is clearly not a fit for the period depicted in the film, and is the most dated element within the film today. It just seems silly today.  "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a superlative example of the treatment all classics should receive on DVD. This is a film every DVD library should have+dvd
An ironic anachronism, replete with Hollywood PC shibboleths+N+You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of "Islam is a religion of peace," repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.     A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up.   After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the "President wants to appear presidential." Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a "fascist U.S. Army general", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).  Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them!   But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for "violating the Constitution" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the "fascist" general. Ta-dah!  So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.  Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool.   I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book+dvd
Pure Garbage+N+What a waste of time, money, and talent. If its Murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill. Sorry I wasted my time viewing such trash+dvd
Should not have had the same title as original+N+When I heard that Timecop had a sequl coming out I couldnt wait to see it. Then I found out it wasnt John Claude Vanne Damme.  Why bother making a sequl with no returning cast members? Especially the star. Vanne Damme is replaced by Jason Scott Lee (Jungle book) as the hero who travels through time to prposly change things around here and there. I saw reveiwa that this was a movie for sci fi geeks to enjoy. I didnt see much on the sci fi side apart from time travel, but it makes me wonder why they didnt just name it something else and make a seperate movie instead of calling it a second installment to a great movie+dvd
VERY anti-Christian+N+The movie has many none-too-subtle *VERY* anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing "Christian" TV Evangelists and Christians themselves as stupid zombies; life as basically pointless.  I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm -- DON'T BUY IT!!+dvd
WHAT???????+N+This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.    The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.    The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers+dvd
Fun new show+P+I hate math, but this show has given me a great appreciation for it.  Th cast has great chemistry.  I feel like a couple of the FBI agents when Charlie is explaining a new math formula, so he puts it in layman's terms for them (and me!).  Whether or not you like crime-based shows, you'll love this+dvd
Ryan Gives Standout Portrayal in Noir Misfire+N+Robert Ryan never delivered a bad performance. His memorable portrayal of a Tokyo crime boss is the best thing in "House of Bamboo" (1955) -- director Samuel Fuller's flat attempt at Japanese film noir. Ryan easily towers over Robert Stack's routine characterization, which looks like a dry run for "The Untouchables." Apart from Ryan and Joseph MacDonald's on-location CinemaScope photography, this reworking of the superior "Street With No Name" (1948) collapses at the starting gate. A major disappointment+dvd
Disappointed+N+So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused. +dvd
One of the Effects of Cinematic  Media: Reaction+P+Watching the 1998 THE SIEGE in 2007 and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema.  The obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the FBI, CIA, Military, Terrorists, and public responded to the unimaginable: shouts of protests about 'glorification of occult terrorists', the Hollywood idea of the impossible happening, and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles 'beyond swallowing' are all here in these reviews.  Now, six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view, though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious.  Offensive versus defensive. And after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism' we continue to lose.  Movies that make people think and talk are valuable, and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered.  Yes, there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept, but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, Bruce Willis, Sami Bouajila, Ahmed Ben Larby, Aasif Mandvi among others. And then there are the panoramas of New York City under siege with the Twin Towers standing mightily in the cityscape...  It begs the question: if scriptwriter Lawrence Wright and director Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Glory, Leaving Normal, Legends of the Fall, etc) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces, why weren't the leaders in Washington, DC in tune with 'absurd possibilities'?  It makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film.  Grady Harp, January 07    +dvd
Bow wow+N+I can't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie. Frankly, I thought it was a dog.  Not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing, if improbable. And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.  But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!   It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.  I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched. Puzzled, perhaps, at why anyone would make such a movie. Well, there was that admirable, unlikely friendship. But that was all.  Pass this one by+dvd
WTF?+N+This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It is an insult to the entire BDSM culture.  Not only is the acting horrible but they should have spent the money they did on the sets & costumes on script.  I fail to believe this "Dominatrix" would fall for some loser idiot like him.  Also, I like how the police & right-wingers "can't get close enough to catch them" even though their "dungeon" has a giant door off an alley that is wide open during daylight to move sets around.  This is stupid with a capital S+dvd
Excellent Movie!+P+I thought I would miss Roy Marsden, but Martin Shaw was superb as Adam Dalgliesh+dvd
Excellent in almost every way+P+I am a relative newcomer to the world of Adam Dalgliesh, both in print and in film.  I had read both this novel and a predecessor, 'A Certain Justice,' and came across this film as it was presented over a two-night episode of PBS 'Mystery!.' I am, as it bears mentioning, completely unfamiliar with the work of Roy Marsden in this role, and so approach this presentation with relatively fresh eyes. (Although, I doubt I would have enjoyed his performance having been completely captivated by 'The Sandbaggers.') Shaw's presentation of Dalgliesh is understated, and most definitely contemplative.  Those looking for melodrama will be deeply disappointed. The film retains all the essential elements of the novel, and most of the subtext usually lost in novel to film translations is pleasantly preserved in this rendition.  Certain motivations of the secondary characters are truncated, but this is a necessary convention of the form, and is not done capriciously or in disservice to the overall narrative. My only complaint is the presentation of the actual physical church building.  Given its importance in the overall story, more effort could have been made to create a more imposing, reverant, and solemn atmosphere of this crucial location.  As this is but a minor quibble, I hardily recommend this production, and give it four stars+dvd
Buyers beware this product comes with a fault!+N+The quality of films presented notwithstanding I feel cheated by the manufacturer/distributor which is Time/Warner. Nowhere in any description do they tell you that this DVD comes WITH THE PRETTY NASTY ADVERTISMENTS IN BETWEEN THE SHORTS THAT CANNOT BE ZIPPED PAST! So,as I did not expect commercials for the BMW's, Henry Jaglom's personal phone talks and a few trailers for Hollywood schlock: I would DEFINITELY AVOID ANY OF THEIR SIMILAR . TOO BAD BECAUSE I LOVE SHORT AND UNUSUAL FILMS+dvd
a film that hardly stands out but it's a good pass time!+P+I like this film because several reasons, unlike most of the National Lampoon's I've recently seen, this was the least silly & disgusting. there was a better plot to it, Paris Hilton is a fine actor! alot of people would say she's playing herself in this movie but if u think that, then u don't really know her. but I'm not getting into that. now to the plot, Veronica(Hilton) is the hottest girl in the school, popular, dating the "hottest" guy on campus & is totally rich! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for FHM, she needs the hottest girls to compete with her. only that doesn't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate. there is a journey of self-discovery, lessons to be learned but it's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere. lots of this doesn't make sense but who cares. it's a very cheesy flick but it has humor, nudity, all the things u'd want from a National Lampoon's flick & I give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film! I say it's a good film to see, though maybe not a family film, it's still worth your time!+dvd
disappointing+N+I was expecting a college comedy with plenty of college girl T&A.  But the T&A was minimal, only a couple of quick scenes.  And the movie was only slightly entertaining.  Since the movie wasn't very entertaining for me (a male), and most of the stars of the movie are female...and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots (fools), and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority....I'm thinking this movie must be a "chick flick"...a movie for girls.  Guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting, but they will be disappointed.  Some Paris Hilton fans may like the movie, but be sure to note that Paris Hilton does not get naked in this movie (...but a few other girls get topless).  I wouldn't be surprised to see some girls disagreeing with my assumption that this movie is a "chick flick"...maybe its just a little dull for everyone...(barely watchable)+dvd
Great price for both versions!+P+I personally don't watch the hours of bonus stuff.  I know lots of people do but I never do.  I love this set because we can watch the long versions or the short depending on if we just need a fix or want to spend the entire weekend watching the set. We got a great deal on this set and I love knowing I can watch either version any time.+dvd
typical van damme+N+Is that THE ROCK who is in this movie looking malnourished with the rotted teeth and sinister contact lenses make-up? This movie is horrible. But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are "Kickboxer" and "Bloodsport". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his "acting" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for "Revenge of the Nerds"... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work. It's not like they weren't paid handsomely for their services+dvd
an example of what a Live Action Anime could be like....+N+If done horribly wrong.  Cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong Anime feel to it.  Sadly the movie is complete and total garbage.  The story here is that Jean Claude Van Damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the Anarchist future.  There also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing Mankind, and a Cyborg knows the cure.  That part of the story is irrelivant.  For the most part it is Van Damm traveling across the US attempting to catch up to this Madman and stop him.  Somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion.  OVerall this movie is a waste and you can tell Orion Entertainment was Milking Van Damm for all he was worth at this time.  Avoid+dvd
Aftershock: Earthquake in New York real  and live action+P+I really liked this movie and felt it was well done with much suspense and action.  It was like I was part of the whole movie.  It brought back for me a feeling like it could really happen.  It was true to NY and the people.  The action and acting was really good.  I enjoyed the movie and felt its a winner. +dvd
What do you do with a problem called Mary Clarence?+P+What do you do when you witness you boyfriend killing someone?  Go into witness protection at a convent.  Lounge singer Deloris becomes Sister Mary Clarence.  But when Sister Mary Clarence is Whoopi Goldberg expect a lot of attitude.  Delores finds it hard adjusting to convent life.  That is until she gets her hands on the choir.  She turns a mediocre off key group into a hip ensemble.  This draws too much attention and her mobster boyfriend finds her.  This ends up in a wild chase by the Sisters through a Las Vegas casino.  Maggie Smith is always a good choice for any role but she is wasted a bit as the Mother Superior.  The best supporting roles goes to the three sidekick nuns Mary Patrick, Mary Roberts, Mary Lazarus - Kathy Najimy, newcomer Wendy Makkena and the proverbial nun Mary Wickes (this is her third of four times as basically the same character and she ended her career as a gargoyle on Notre Dame.)  This is a sit back and enjoy film, no messages, not much to think about.

TEMPO SKIPS A BEAT+N+In this derivative, limp made for Canadian TV movie, Melanie Griffith stumbled through the role of a glitzy "courier" for obviously illegal products.  She has a younger live-in stud (Hugh Dancy in a weak performance) and is sent on a secretive mission by Malcolm McDowell (he pops up in almost anything these days).  Melanie also has a sleazy additional boss (played with absent malice by Art Malik) who screws up the McDowell deal and then demands eighty thousand dollars for the effort.  Along comes lovely Rachael Leigh Cook (who deserves better than this) who suddenly becomes the true love of Dancy's miserable life.  Dancy is such a spineless cad one can hardly feel sympathy for the miss the three of them end up in.  It's all been done before and much much better.  TEMPO is a composition without any heart+dvd
thrills and romance+P+when i first began watching this movie i thought what is going on all these lights and cars chasing each other but after i got past that i thought it was a wonderful movie. melanie was ok and rachel was amazing but hugh dancy was the most amazing one of all. i never expected to see him that way and to see that shower seen well......i'll let every one see it for themselves. i think this movie was really great and who ever doesn't think so should watch it again because maybe they fell asleep or some thing because this movie was great+dvd
Flyboys=Pearl Harbour...No redeeming value except as a clear illustration of how NOT to make a combat flying film+N+This stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from 2001 "Pearl Harbour" starring Ben Affleck. The acting is wooden and forgettable, the action sequences are humorous at best, and the direction is...well, let's just say, director Tony Bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in "Barb Wire". The directing style seems to be...throw in as much loud music as possible, add a heaping helping of a lame love story, toss on some of the worst, most embarrassing lines imaginable, and let's not forget those all important CGI effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of WW1 flying action since the Three stooges.   If you want to watch REAL WW1 flying action with REAL WW1 biplanes, check out "The Blue Max". That movie used real WW1 vintage aircraft, that actually have weight to them and do NOT perform impossible flying stunts that the Blue Angels do not even attempt using FA-18 jets.   Pacing is terribly frantic, music is insufferable, character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent.  Pass this one by, unless you're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive, wasteful, useless, hollywood blockbuster bomb+dvd
Flyboys+P+I enjoyed this DVD and the suplemental DVD as well. I give this film four stars because of the great computer graphics and the clean plot. The reality factor was taken a little too far concerning the aircraft abilities/ capabilities of that time era. Still...the film was enjoyable. I can't help but wish that they developed the characters more. I guess there are time restraints and such to consider. Anyway, a fun movie to relax with and eat pop corn with your family! Sure beats watching yet another ho hum flesh eatting zombie spin off that seems to always be showing up(smile)+dvd
5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the trick+N+ok, First off everyone knows this is a great movie, but considering how many times it has been re-packaged for DVD over the last 5 years, you know they will be doing the ol' double dip trick again now that it's come to Blu-Ray. This is the first (Blu-ray) release and, yes, a great price from amazon for sure. I'd wait for the unrated extended (152min) cut that's available now for cheap on DVD. Be warned if u buy this one, more versions will come+dvd
Appalling Loses Its Meaning...+N+...when applied to this DVD.  It would appear to have been transferred from a VHS copy.  It's so soft as to be impossible to watch.  I hope the director's family (he died in 1970) is simply holding back the original masters in hopes of making a deal for an authorized DVD version.  "The Red Balloon" is such a wonderful little movie -- perhaps the best introduction to the cinema for any child -- but it is almost destroyed by the condition of the source used for this transfer.  Can't we have a version that matches the film's vision for its 50th anniversary+dvd
......NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!.....+N+I did not like hardly a thing about this war picture, Anthony Mann or no Anthony Mann [Director]...Robert Ryan was superb being in command of a motley squad of straggler/soldiers...even the macho Aldo Ray was a know-it-all who showed NO fear whatso ever [that included Army Officers also]...that's alot of claptrap...hip/hip/hooray for Hollywood...this stuff may have permeated US Army cadres in the field [ and in Hollywood studios] but it could never have happen with a US Marine squad of highly trained riflemen [13 Marines]...nary any semblence of discipline nor any sense of mission showed amongst the enlisted men in this drab Army movie...it was a foregone conclusion that most of them would be KIA by movies' end...I saw this movie in 1957; it never impressed me with what we,[I]saw and done in Korea with my Fleet Marine Force comrades in the field...many decades later, I review it with even more snickering hysterics...no way, GI...no way!!....Semper Fidelis....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FM+dvd
American Knitter learn how to knit 3 dvd set+P+I just received this dvd set on tuesday and by thursday I have learned to cast on the proper way, knit, purl, increase, decrease, cast off, hold my yarn the proper way etc. etc. Tracy is the greatest!! I feel like I went from an insecure beginner to a confident intermediate knitter in just two days.  I haven't even begun dvd lesson number 3, but I am secure in the fact that I will master it and become an intermediate or better knitter because of this awesome teacher.  She is friendly, patient, and very pleasant and caring as she guides you through each step of the way.  I hope she will put out another series where she teaches you to understand knitting patterns.  Thanks Tracy!+dvd
offbeat mystery+P+If you like mystery's with a twist, this movie is pretty good. If you are offended easily by certain subjects, language, or sexual situations, I would not recommend this movie as it is quite graphic and vulgar+dvd
One of the Best Criterion releases yet.+P+In this 5 disc set, the five Antoine Doinel films are released. All are by François Truffaut.   The first film, "The 400 Blows" or "Le Quatre Cents Coups" was previouslly released by the Criterion Collection but was taken out of print until this version was released. Truffaut based it loosely on his own troubled adolescence. It follows 14 year old Antoine Doinel's youth playing hooky from school, later running away from home and eventually sent to a juvenile deliquent center.   The second film "Antoine and Collette" or ""Antoine et Colette" was originally a segment of a film titled "L'Amour à vingt ans" or "Love at Twenty" It follows his life as he is in his late teens working in a phonograph record factory.   The third film, "Stolen Kisses" or "Baisers volés" covers his dishonorable discharge from the army, his reunion with his girlfriend, and subsequent attempts to find a steady job   The fourth film, "Bed & Board" or "Domicile conjugal" skips ahead to after he is married. It covers his wife's pregnancy, his son's birth, and an adulterous affair he has with a Japanese woman.   The fifth and final film, "Love on the Run" or "L'Amour en fuite" covers the process of his divorce and reunion with an ex flame.   The films wer made between 1959 and 1979 and Jean-Pierre Léaud reprises his role for each film. The films are very impressive and quite rare for there to be series like this. Each film has some fine secenes and some interesting comedy. The acting is good and many scenes are well photographed.   The box set has some excellent special features also.  out of the five discs, four are numbered. For describing the special features, I will list the unnumbered disc as the last one.  Disc one contains the first two films. 400 Blows and Antoine & Colette. The supplements for the 400 Blows are similar to ones in the out of print version. There are two audio commentaries. One is by film professor, Brian Stonehill and the other is by Robert Lachenay who was a lifelong friend of François Truffaut. The commentary by Lachenay is in French with subtitles. There is also audition footage for three of the child actors in the film. Jean-Pierre Léaud who played Antoine, Patrick Auffay, who played Rene, and Richard Kanayan who played Abbou. There is also footage of Jean-Pierre at the Cannes film festival for the screening of the film and a theatrical trailer. There are also two television interviews with François Truffaut about the making of the film.  It also contains the short film, Antoine and Colette.    Disc two contains the film Stolen Kisses along with the following special features:  There is News footage of Truffaut's participation in the sucessful attempt to shut down the 1968 Canne Film Festival to support students and striking workers, a TV spot of Truffaut and Jean-Luc Goddard showing ther support for Cinémathèque française founder, Henri Langlois at a time when his job was in jeopardy, news footage of French cinema VIP's protesting against the planned removal of Henri Langlois from his job, excerpts from a TV interview with Truffaut discussing actor Jean-Pierre Léaud's portrayal of Antoine, and a video introduction to the film and events surrounding its release presented by film historian Serge Toubiana.  Disc three contains the film Bed and Board with the following supplements:  Behind the scenes footage with interviews of some of the cast & crew, a TV interview with Jean-Pierre talking about the film being the last in the series (before Truffaut decided to make the fifth and final film,) a TV interview with Truffaut and Bernard Revon discussing how the write the scripts, and a scene from a Truffaut documentary where he discusses the character of Antoine Doinel.  Disc four contains the final film in the series Love on the Run along with the following  Truffaut and Marie-France Pisier talking about their work on the film and their feelings about the film, Scenes of a TV interview with Truffaut talking about his feelings on ending the series, There is also a theatrical trailer.  The final unnumbered disc contains:  François Truffaut's 1957 short film, "Les Mistons" or "The Mischief Makers" about some young teenage boys who attempt to sabotage the relationship of an older couple. The film also has oprional audio commentary by Claude De Givray. It is in French with English subtitles. There is also a primer for the film presented by Serge Toubiana, a noted film historian.  There is also a 44 minute interview with co-writers Claude deGivray and Bernard Revon. A scene from a 1961 documentary titled "François Truffaut," a 1981 TV interview with Truffaut, and a slide show of movie posters for the four feature length Doinel films.  This set is a must buy for those who like the series as well as Criterion collectors, and fans of François Truffaut's work+dvd
WAY TO GO WILLIE WORSLEY+P+Saw the movie and it was great, especially since I grew up knowing Willie Worsley (and Mr.Worsley, if you are reading this,  I still hate Basketball!!)...but it was a great movie depicting more than just the success of the team, it was a success for the times. Mr. Worsley continued to break grounds, and his love and devotion to the welfare and success of many youths, to this day, is a testament to his lifelong vocation, that of a TRUE mentor, father figure, leader and friend+dvd
Taxi Driver+P+A "must have" classic! Keeps you watching on the edge of your chair and wanting for more. I highly recommend+dvd
swallow+N+The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.  Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.  It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable.+dvd
The Battle of The Banter--Hepburn and Grant Make This A "Holiday" Worth Taking+P+There was a big controversy earlier this year with "The Cary Grant Box Set" which is a great collection in its own right.  Many people were upset that it included the first release of "Holiday" which was new to DVD (unlike the other films in the collection), but no stand alone disc was being offered.  Well, good news.  If all you wanted was "Holiday" and you held out, here it comes ten months later.  Now, I've always had a soft spot for "Holiday."  It hasn't achieved quite the classic status as a couple of other Hepburn and Grant pairings--"The Philadelphia Story" and "Bringing Up Baby"--but I actually think that works to its advantage.  I might get into trouble for this, but I somewhat prefer this to the more antic "Bringing Up Baby" (Don't shoot me, I know it's a great film too).   Cary Grant plays a carefree soul that becomes engaged to a millionaire's spoiled, socialite daughter.  He is expected to take life more seriously and responsibly--but that's not necessarily in his master plan.  Grant, as always, is charming--the quips and physicality that were his trademark are used to good effect here.  Katherine Hepburn, as the girl's sister, is obviously a better match for him!  Hepburn uses her rapid fire delivery and plays smart and wry better than anyone else in her era.  Of course, Grant and Hepburn have great chemistry and it's a joy to see these two masters banter.  There's plenty of slapstick, but part of "Holiday"'s charm is that it balances this with real romance.  It's funny and sweet.  Any fan of Grant, Hepburn, director George Cukor, classics and/or screwball comedy needs to check this film out.  It'll make you smile.  KGHarris, 10/06+dvd
Obviously there is an audience for this product....+N+George A. Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them. Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film.  For this viewer the 'parody' eludes.  LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark, grotesque, poorly written, hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre.  But how fine actors like Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum.  Grady Harp, December 0+dvd
JIM CARREY AT HIS BEST +P+JIM CARREY IS SO VERY NEAR HIS BEST! OR BEST   This movie made me laugh! SO MUCH ! The Story Plot was very well done.  Supporting cast was also very good .   Best scene,  was when he got pulled over while speeding, and showed all his tickets.  had me dying   Jubril  [...]  Teenage Business Pheno+dvd
Sheer Joy!+P+I've adored Leahy since I stumbled across their first CD, several years ago. AFAIK, this is their first DVD, and I sincerely hope it's the first of many. The DVD presents their first broadcast show for PBS. This family puts on a wonderful show, and the music they make is beyond outstanding. They combine traditional Cape Breton and Irish/Scottish fiddling syles with updated instrumental accompaniment in a way that injects modern vitality into already wonderful traditional musical styles. And Donelle Leahy, their lead fiddler, can't really be quite human! Don't neglect to watch the "additional performances" section of the DVD--it was a crime to cut *any* part of this production from the broadcast+dvd
Horrible+N+The storyline and acting in this movie are painful, to say the least. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words.  The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melodramatic, and there is no plot line what-so-ever.  I know we can expect these types of movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at one  University, drop out and transfer to another University, and then return to the first university...all in one semester was absurd.  Have the writers of this movie ever attended a University? Did they do any sort of research for this at all? I would not recommend purchasing or renting this movie. It is not worth the money. If you feel you must see this monstrosity,  I would borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to buy it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances. The whole movie is garbage and a waste of time.+dvd
Great series+P+I hated to see this series cancelled. It was great, different from all the other shows out there. Thankfully it is out on dvd, with episodes that were not aired on t.v. I like to think of the 12 episodes a a mini seroes of sorts. Although it does leave the watcher wanting more, it sort of ties itself up nicely+dvd
One woman, and what a woman, against them all+P+Hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character, against all the Indiana Joneses and Bruce Lees of the world. Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.

Oh, no...+N+What a disappointment. Watching Matthau and Lemmon struggle so hard to make this clanker enjoyable was nothing less than depressing. Part of the enjoyment of the first Odd Couple was the clash of personalities between Felix's anal retentive, obsessive/compulsion and Oscar's boorish impatience. This film hardly touches upon that struggle and, instead, becomes a watered-down version of one of the Grumpy Old Men movies. In fact, this movie seems like a compilation of other Neil Simon movies. When Felix and Oscar get lost in the Californian desert, it's "The Out of Towners", except in reverse. When Oscar's son gets cold feet on his wedding day and camps out on the roof, it's like "Plaza Suite."  Also the use of the F-word and of middle fingers just makes the movie seem all that much more desperate for laughs. Lastly, the Florida/California milieu is just inappropriate for these two neurotic but iconic New Yorkers+dvd
Maybe OK for fans of M. Night Shyamalan+N+Not really scary. Just loud noises and shots of speeding cars, a spinning fan, and sunsets. Oh, there must be some big shocker at the end, right? Not really. There is some notable cinematography and some decent music, but other than that, this wasn't even worth a rental for me+dvd
Something gets lost in translation+N+I recently rented this movie, having never seen it before.  I'm wondering what all the kudo's were for.  Denuve was pretty and had a boyfriend who was interested in her.  Why did she lock herself in that ratty apartment?  Did she have a history of mental illness?  If she didn't like being alone why didn't she go with her sister or visit her parents for the weekend.  We're never told.  I was confused and bored.  What a let down+dvd
Disaster at Sea+N+It takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the Virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service.  And it is two completely wasted hours.  Hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover, the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship, the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship, the bad acting, the farcical piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like Amelia Earhart confused about why she's on a ship instead of her plane. The movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much.  I watched it because of the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso.  He is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables. +dvd
Excellent Western+P+An excellent cast, great adventure for western lovers. Each of the stars shine in their characters from a Black Camanche sold to a determined mountain man to get his furs back from indians later massacred and taken by a ruthless bounty hunter. And yes, there is romance+dvd
Santana playing the blues?? C'mon.+N+I have my doubts as to Santana' music for quiet a long time- it seems that he loves his place and role as a rock icon too much and forgot to do music. Let me be more specific- I never liked his salsa last records and thought that this is no music. For a guitar player who invented new ideas and streams in the rock guitar-playing world, these records were an insult- no less. I am really sure that Santana himself admits- deep down in his heart- that he looks for better music. It can be that these guilt feelings brought him to "create" this DVD. Well, if I am right in my analysis, he did wrong in his music, again. Nothing connects Santana to the blues and he will not convince (at least me) that he was raised on the knees of the blues. C'mon, forty years of career and now he revels that he is rooted in the blues??  Sorry, I don't buy it. Now, as Santana is not a blues guitar player, and never was- this DVD cannot be good and there are a lot of reasons for it: Santana' playing the blues is loud and vulgar while all other three guitar players (Bobby Parker, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown and Buddy Guy) have a small and unique sound, Santana' technique (which was always amazing) covers a lack of touch and feeling while all three base their playing on feeling, emotion and the right sound- Santana, on the other hand, covers his disadvantages in playing the blues with all lot of notes. Now, if you want to purchase good blues guitar playing DVD go for each of the three (meaning: Bobby Parker, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown and Buddy Guy) for their own records. If you like Santana (past or present) go for his own but, don't mix between them as Santana did. One more thing- Santana relates to Jeff Beck in his words added to this DVD and I agree that this is a good example- anyone who wants to understand the meaning of the blues and rock/blues guitar should address to Jeff Beck, not to Santana whom we still expect, after so many years, to create real music.  +dvd
Ditto on being better than the first.+P+I loved this film. The writting, story, special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original. I recomend this film to any fan of the genre+dvd
Funny but typical+P+This seems to follow a typical pattern of Danny Kaye movies: a zero turns into a hero.  However, you'll also find laughable moments like Kaye's other works.  It's funny, but it's not one of his best movies.  If you could see this for free, I'd recommend watching it.  Otherwise, you might want to watch one of Kaye's other, higher quality movies.+dvd
A Poor Excuse For A DVD+N+Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!  Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it "digital transfer" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.  I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.  The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing.+dvd
Not really essential+N+Now I love the Clash as much as anyone else, but this DVD isn't really needed. THey made some of the greatest records of all time, but they never really made great videos. More interviews and live performances would have been nice, and the inclusion of the late, great Joe Strummer's short film is a welcome addition, but I would recommend that you just buy the studio albums over this DVD&gt+dvd
Ultimately disappointing+N+This film had a lot of potential--interesting premise, compelling characters and a strong cast--but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story.  There's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director.  The above-average cast, that includes the wonderful Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and several other very likable young actors, seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone.  The redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion didn't quite make it.  A pity as, despite the film's continuing weaknesses, I wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters. +dvd
TRULY BAD+N+There's absolutely no way anybody with any love for the movies or Woody Allen could love this really really poor movie. I thought Hollywood Ending was bad but this is worse!!!  If you are a Woody Allen fan do yourself a favor and stay away from this one! The man has many a good movies in his filmography this is certainly not one of them !!!!!!!!+dvd
Not suitable for people with functional cremasters+N+Go to www.cremaster.net and download the trailer for the full cremaster cycle. . . . then realize how awesome it looks and how much this dvd sucks. I was wondering where the movie was on this DVD, but then realized you only get a 30 minute clip and can watch lots of alternat shots of the same stuff.  The minute long trailer on the website is SOOOOO much better.  Highlight: Camera Movement is kool when it moves all slow and stuff+dvd
A bad sequel.+N+Stephen King is the master of writing, and when he wrote the original story: Pet Sematary, he was on his game, in the zone, and THE MAN.  This second movie is someones attempt at cashing in on the original works of the King, and has been poorly done. Did, Stephen write a second novel? No. He has so many other stories that they could make into movies, why spend the money on something like this second film. It was a dive-bomb in theaters, that should tell you something. Bad--Just bad.  +dvd
No!!!+N+Just like the ancient Indian Micmac burial ground there is no earthly, logical explanation as to why this movie exists. If you enjoyed the original or even the book then do yourself a favor and skip this facical, supposed 'sequel' created merely to cash in on a name.  M+dvd
Dark, morbid and disturbing, but lacking that special something that made the original great.+N+"Pet Sematary Two" was directed by the same Mary Lambert who directed the original "Pet Sematary" and the similarities in style are clearly evident between the two movies.  Once again, Lambert paints a disturbingly dark and morbid picture in part two of this horror movie series.    Basically, the plot centers around a young boy played by Edward Furlong who is absolutely devastated by his mother's grisly demise...naturally, he would do anything to get his mother back and eventually does.  The basic premise behind this movie appears to be that the evil force behind the pet sematary is calling upon Furlong's character to resort to the pet sematary to bring back his mother along with some incredible evil as well.  Overall, the movie works a good bit like the original and while it is certainly an entertaining enough movie for horror movie fans, the sequel is not nearly as effective as the original.  One strong area that the original "Pet Sematary" had was the very interesting character of Jud played very well by Fred Gwynne...Jud's character carries the momentum of each scene in the original and basically made "Pet Sematary" work, but we don't have that strong character presence to make the wheels go round in this sequel, therefore the movie comes across flat.  What we do have in this sequel is an average horror movie that attempts to cash in on the success of the original classic.    Perhaps, the characters in "Pet Sematary II" are just weak in general (no disrespect to Clancy Brown or Anthony Edwards), but something is missing here in part two of this series despite the similarities in the dark and disturbing atmosphere painted so meticulously by Lambert.  Quite frankly, I did not like the casting of Edward Furlong as the main character to begin with...I don't know but it just left a bad taste in my mouth about this movie...he's such an uncharasmatic dork and his hard to sympathize with, notwithstanding the obvious limitations of his acting abilities.    The bottom line is that due to the lack of quality characters present in "Pet Sematary Two", the sequel just isn't near as compelling as the original.  Because "Pet Sematary Two" isn't anywhere near as good, nor as emotionally compelling as the original classic.  Indeed, one is left to wonder if a sequel was a smart move here.  Still, with that being said, "Pet Sematary Two" is not a terrible movie and so I give it TWO STARS which means it's just fair or average, but I would be remiss if I did not say that I've certainly seen a lot worse...just check out some of my other reviews and see what I mean.+dvd
Thunsercats Forever+P+Awesome!! If you know anything about this boxed set then you know that its a must have for your collection+dvd
Care-A-Lot Is A Place We All Can Go . . .+P+The Care Bears movie is a wonderful movie for the whole family.  With great voice acting, including Mickey Rooney as the narrator, Mr. Cherrywood, this is a special treat that will warm your heart and make you laugh.    The opening song was written and sung by the great Carole King.  It sets the stage for what the Care Bears are all about.  In their clouds and rainbow filled Care-A-Lot, they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend.  Little stars flit about and help them.  The story is about a magician's assistant named Nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit.  Nicholas has always felt lonely.  The evil spirit takes advantage of that, and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring.  This is almost too much for the gentle Care Bears.  Luckily, they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the Forest of Feelings with other cute critters.  There are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful.  As far as this being a feature-length commercial, the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more Care Bear Cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge.  But that is minor.  My husband even loved this movie and was humming along at the closing song! +dvd
A great gift to all who loved the man+P+To really get an artist's personality, sometimes you need to see them live. I don't know if that's true with Johnny but I know it sure doesn't hurt. This is a very young Johnny with Luther and Marshal. Three friends, lots of fans, and a set of songs that you'll probably recognize from his few albums that were out at that time. Yes, there are several repeat performances but nothing really overshadows the fact that you get to see this piece of music history. It doesn't take any of the shine off it is what I'm saying. Complete with some teasing onstage banter and a one or two minute bout of outright goofyness as Johnny imitates an anonymous singer...if you can't figure out that it's Elvis he's impersonating...than you don't know Elvis and you were born in a cave. This is not a rock and roll show by any means. It's perfect and original country concert and what a collectors item. A real treasure. Glad I got a hold of a copy. No problems with audio or visual quality. For the time period, having to turn the volume up a little extra is not an issue [for me atleast]. Enjoy+dvd
great patriotic movie+P+the stroyline of the screenplay is a little shallow, but the directing, acting, camera are all good, especially the stunt, the choregraphic design of the fight scenes are amazingly fantastic. the only problem i found in thai historical movie is the hairdo. almost every one of the male and female roles in this movie are with hairdos that only hairdressers could have done and with lot of gel used. but again, the alamo-like fighting scenes are so vicious and realistic just like what best korean movies could deliver+dvd
Outstanding production+P+This is an outstanding production that I seriously recommend. Saint Sains wrote many operas that are totally neglected today. Many of them had historical themes and were completelly out of fashion when Wagners "fantasy operas" ruled the opera world. Lets hope we will heare more of this brilliant composers neglected operas+dvd
dissapointment season where ideas ran out+N+I am a big fan of the pretender series and I just wanted to share my disappointment's on season 4 where it's an ending of a comedy season and not a fun season that we've seen in first 3 seasons. I believe they ran out of ideas and they just wanted to fill in the blanks and put any crap. I was really disappointed. :( I recommend no one to buy it, not to mention it's pretty expensive as it is.+dvd
Karma -- Clint Eastwood Style+P+It's a movie as morally complex as the history of America itself.    Yes, the town, Lago, has blood on its hands.  Yes, the townspeople have flirted with evil by having three common thugs bullwhip their sheriff to death because he would likely report their mine as located on federal lands and so endanger their ambitions for limitless wealth.  Yet, the movie also appears to see the town, Lago, as worthy of redemption.  After railroading the thugs into prison, the town very conveniently proceeds to pretend that nothing ever happened:  "These are God fearing people," the new sheriff earnestly tells the High Plains Drifter.  However, when the thugs are released from prison, they seek to receive their back wages in the blood of the townspeople who doublecrossed them.    Only when the townspeople experience the same terror that their bullwhipped sheriff must have experienced does the High Plains Drifter reappear to save them from the thugs.  Indeed, at the end of movie, when the High Plains Drifter rides away from town on horseback, a tombstone is erected with the name of the murdered sheriff.  Unlike the outlaws, the townspeople feel a very real sense of collective guilt, which the High Plains Drifter and their ordeal have reawakened.  Perhaps that is the hope of America -- that we do have guilt over our past and we do not just pretend that nothing ever happened. +dvd
I love it+P+Great movie..A real love story. Just watch it..thats all I have to say+dvd
A sure contender for the Academy Awards+N+There came a time in my life, not too long ago, when I realized I had zero acting talent and [pulling] in my gut every time I was topless just wasn't cutting it anymore. Now if only David Hasselhoff had done the same..+dvd
A beautiful, sweet story, both for children and adults+P+I first was attracted by the music and I them got the DVD from the Public Library.  After viewing it a number of times, I just had to have my own copy.  The Irish legend of the silkies is presented with assuming warmth and understanding.  It truely is pure magic+dvd
A strong family drama, well worth watching...+P+With 21st century eyes, it's wonderful to see a family like the Waltons. Although they are scrabbling against poverty, living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during the Depression, they are happy. The large family, which includes seven children, parents, and grandparents, is loving and supportive. Sure, the kids aren't angels -- like any others, they squabble and have their problems. But when push comes to shove, they've got one another's backs, like when eldest sister Mary Ellen beats up a classmate for mocking little brother Jim Bob's shirt (made from sister Erin's old dress) or when eldest brother John-Boy defends Mary Ellen from a potential assault by a guest staying with the family.  Most gratifying is the children's overall contentment. Sure, they aspire for "things" - they long to see a traveling circus that comes to the mountains, and they pause by toys displayed in the general store. But for the most part, they don't dwell upon what they don't have. They take contentment in life in general, and when the occasional treat comes their way, they truly appreciate it...unlike many kids today, whose parents buy them the latest iPods and video games, and it's STILL not enough.   The Waltons' saga is told through the eyes of eldest son John-Boy, who is 17 and aspires to be a writer. He is based on Earl Hamner, a Virginia native who wrote "Spencer's Mountain," the book upon which the show is based. Hamner does a voiceover in each episode, speaking as the adult John-Boy looking back on his childhood.  (For the record, I'm 26 years old, not someone who grew up with this show, or looks down upon "today's youth" from the vantage of age. But, as you know, not all young folks are content with the attitudes of today's society as a rule. I, for one, truly wish we could return to a simpler time; it won't be long before our complicated lives lead us to self-destruct.+dvd
Very Erotic+P+NUDITY!!!We get three different nude french chicks. All show bush. The film wasn't full of sex but it had this underlying erotic feel that just makes you horny. So when you did get to see some hot nude chick you were ready to go. The beast thing was strange but very erotic the way he kept getting harder and harder and the girl kept accidently getting him of as he spued gallons of semen everywhere. Nice full frontal and I found it very erotic. CAREFUL at the begining is some real horse sex. Gaint horse penis and throbbing femal horse vigina, I couldn't even watch it, very nasty, be ready to fast forward. What was the director thinking+dvd
Big giant kiss-up to a terrorist, before he was a mall goth T-shirt+N+Besides committing the worst cinematic sin of being boring and self-indulgent, this bromide of a film is an utter distortion of how Che Guevara developed into a sadistic murderer and rapist. This yawner shows him as a spoiled medical student who helps a leper colony, but does little to explain how he became a power-hungry militant with a notorious reputation for ruthlessness. He established forced labor camps to torture and kill innocent people. In one account, a child in his guerrila unit was immediately shot without trial for having stolen some food. He helped to destroy hundreds of years of a rich Cuban culture (see "Before Night Falls" to understand how the Castro government stifled free speech and tortured innocent people). Meanwhile, he was a hypocrite, living in a rich Havana estate like the so-called "capitalist oppressors" he tried to eradicate. But don't expect to see that story in this dull, droning film.+dvd
Alone in the Wilderness+P+I loved watching this movie on TV and purchased it for my father for Fathers Day. Its sooo hard to find something he doesn't already have and I thought he would really enjoy this movie.+dvd
BOYCOTT THIS GARBAGE! EDITED MUSIC LOW GRADE PICTURE AND SOUND!+N+This is really irritating! This show (at least in the early years) is as good as any show ever was! The fact that the studio is too cheap to pay for the rights to the music is ridiculous! To add insult to injury the picture and sound are bargain basement quality! I think everyone who bought this or any other show that has been altered should return the shows for a full refund. Let the cheapskate studio eat the loss instead of making the fans digest this SH**+dvd
I know Christy and she's no Christy . . . .+N+To be blunt, Laura Lee Smith's Christy is petulant and immature.  I like Diane Ladd as an actress, but her portrayal of Alice Henderson is bland.  Thumbs up to the men -- Stewart Finaly-McLennan and James Waterson.  Also, Dale Dickey did a great job with the role of Opal McHone and I thought Emily Perkins and Olivia Kelly were outstanding as Zady Spencer and Ruby Mae (respectively.  The script could have provided a much better transitions in several place.  Most notably, we see the good-by to one beau.  It would have been more emotionally satisfying to see her say "YES!" to the other.  While some performances were excellent, the movie must stand on the overall performance of the cast, director and screenwriters.  With Christy and Alice being so central to the story, it simply doesn't make it.  We all knew who she would end up with, anyway, didn't we???  Much better to go back and watch the CBS series or better yet, read the book! +dvd
Not as good as I remember.+N+Zandalee, Zandalee, Zandalee.  Where do I start? Well, I watched this movie on cable a couple of times when I was still a child, and I remember it being a good but forbidden movie. I decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic. But watching it as an adult has shown me one thing: it's bad in every way. From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with  consentual desire already. I guess my changing view about Zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old.  Bottom Line: No wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it+dvd
But we can be any self we want, can't we?+N+The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film.  I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie.  I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ... "why"?  Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit.  There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation.  Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending.  It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution.  Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved.  This was my biggest issue with this film.  The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine "ripple-effect" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.   Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film.  I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it.  It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all.  Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed.  Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent.  She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time.  She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement.  It nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister.  She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention?  That was confusing and completely random.  Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent.  Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything.  The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud.  I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally "poofed" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama.  It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts).  Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was nearly a "cut-and-paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story.  Don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story.  Again using the "cut-and-paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to.  It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ... but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood.  Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.    The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble.  There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to Grandma about.  More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation.  What may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me.  Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ... eeewwww).  Also, she wore the same dress everyday.  That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television.  Sex and dirty laundry.  Now there is a great film for you!  There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish.  Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.  Overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful.  I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation.  I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation.  Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used.  If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ... then, maybe this film is for you!  Grade: * out of ****+dvd
only 5 mins of Alvin Lee/Ten Years After!!??+N+..whats all that about? I'm putting this crap on eBay first chance I get, I'm totally disgusted at the editing ,not because of how it was edited at the time of original release, but because they have not extended the songs to there original length . Ten Years After's 'I cant Keep from crying' with extended guitar solo from Alvin Lee, was nearly 20 minuites long and they put barely 5 minuites of it on here. This could have been made into an extended package, like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been . There is little enough footage of Ten Years After&Alvin Lee out there, yet Jethro Tull's full Isle of Wight 'full' 1 hour set has been released on DVD . Nice remastering, shame about the footage.+dvd
Good history in the Balkans+P+I was stationed in the Balkans and thhat's where I saw this movie for the first time.  Hearing about the atrocities committed in Bosnia and Serbia frankly disturbed me, but seeing this movie gives you a visual of what life was really like in the Balkans.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning what life is like in a war with no sympathy for a fellow human being.  These mass murders were a travesty for all, but it is important to understand the history of this hatred that Serbs, Croats, and Muslims had for each other in order to properly put into context these countries as they stand today, slowly trying to rebuild after such a cruel devestation of their homeland as well as their human spirit+dvd
STUNNING!!!+P+I just completed three viewings of the Anchor Bay Release of this movie...I was stunnded & awestruck at the sheer beauty of this DVD. Every scene was carefully composed to show off the greatest beauty possible...Pure Eye Candy. The colors were bright and crisp and well defined. The sound quality was superb. One rarelly finds this perfection in this old of a movie+dvd
Dracula lives+P+I think this movie is great. The plot is so different from the others. I realy like this movie.+dvd
Clockwise ..John Cleese at his best!+P+To anyone who attended a British public school this is a MUST VIEW! To any one else who has a sense of humour or who likes to keep their lives organized it is also unparalleled. The scene where Cleese plays a monk chasing a young lady along a country lane says it all. Headmasters...this one's for you+dvd
What the ???+N+I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of MIMIC 2. After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good. Now, don't waste your time watching this movie+dvd
"I Stand In The Dark With A Blade In My Hand"  ~  Physican Heal Theyself+P+Esteemed psychiatrist Martin Dysart (Ricard Burton) takes on a case nobody else wants to deal with. Alan Strang (Peter Firth), an eighteen year old working at the local stables blinds four horses with a metal spike in an unpresidented night of unspeakable madness. As Dr. Dysart delves into the causes leading up to the event he soon realizes he is dealing with more than just a confused, emotionally unstable teenager. He has stumbled upon a shocking tale of intense spiritual devotion gone horribly wrong.  As the ongoing therapy with Alan reaches its climax Dr. Dysart finally comes face to face with the young mans' inner passion and divine obsession. An encounter which challenges Dysart to finally look into his own soul and confront his personal demons and loss of passion. As though peering into a mirror darkly it eventually becomes a case of "Physican Heal Thyself."    Truly one of the darkest, most penetrating journeys into a troubled mind you will ever view. Peter Shaffer's masterful screenplay along with director Sidney Lumet performing at the top of his craft have brought to life a harrowing vision not soon to be forgotten. +dvd
Seniors+P+I found this DVD very informative for teaching seniors who exercise in a chair.  The movements are different than those I was doing and I really needed some new ideas.  Thank+dvd
SENDING IT BACK.+N+I cannot rate this item because it came DEFECTIVE.  I have not been able to view it.  VERY disappointed by this transaction.  I plan to send this item back+dvd
wow...+N+I wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star, because this movie certainly doesn't deserve any. I'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that I could write a better script than this. PLEASE don't waste your money. As the person who reveiwed this before me said, watch this only to make fun of the bad acting.  Oh, and for the record, you can actually hear the director yelling "Cut!" at the end of one of the scenes+dvd
thank you i am a happy go luckly boy oh boy oh boy +P+so fast i think he drove out to my house himself and put it in my mailbo+dvd
Will Ferral?+N+Amazon service is fantastic but only some parts in the Will Ferrel DVD's were funny - nothing i would recommend to people+dvd
Average Movie+N+I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review.  This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript.  To compare it to "Run Lola Run" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend "Cube".  +dvd
Most Excellent Inane Drivel+P+Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan totally rule in this bodacious movie extravaganza! A time-traveling rock and roll tribute to that greatest of all lost bands, "Wyld Stallyons"!    The other reviews have pretty much said it all, although I must exclaim that: "I don't understand why people complain that this movie is inane."  Of course it is!  Didn't you know that when you popped it in the video player or went to see it at the movie?!?  It is inane drivel from wall to wall, although there are some most excellent puns thrown in , such as Napoleon spending his day in San Dimas at a water-slide park called "Waterloop"...get it?....Waterloo...p?  Like I said, pretty much inane drivel, but I like it like that.    Ted Theodore Logan in his more pensive moments leans toward a proto-Neo acting style which will thrill fans of the Matrix series.    People who complain about inane comedy are people who aren't funny themselves, and I hate people like that!  But fortunately for the future of the planet, unenlightened souls like myself can always invoke that core principle of peaceful planets everwhere...be excellent to each other.  And don't forget to wind your watch!  +dvd
Plum must be turning in his grave!+N+Unlike the first three seasons, which were nothing short of brilliant, this season seems to have lost the Wodehouse touch. The absolute low point was a madcap chase up the Empire State Building; both Bertie and Jeeves were completely out of character. I got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately. I highly recommend the first three sets, but if you're a Wodehouse purist, pass on this fiasco+dvd
Silence on every playground+P+This is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that doesn't disappoint.  It's a bleak and distubing look at the world, two decades from now.  Chaos has erupted everywhere as people are overcome by an overwhelming hopelessness.  This fear is generated due to the fact that no child has been born for eighteen years.  It's a countdown to extinction. Theo(Clive Owen) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country.  To the casual viewer this may not seem like much of a task, unless you can really submerse yourself in the context of the volatile situation.  I totally got caught up in the effort, completely absorbed by the significance of this mission.  The action really kept me on edge. I was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes, you know--hell, fire and brimstone.  Any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points.  This is touched on periodically, but doesn't go too over the top.  I also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read "Last one to die, please turn out the lights".  There's always gotta be a prankster. Overall, I thought this was a great movie--action-packed, original, and insightful+dvd
disdisgutingly gory+P+to To be totally honest, I only saw this movie once. It was in 1974 when I was 12 years old. Yes, we snuck into the theatre. I remember the warnings at the time. " completely concerned with disgusting gory violence" Those warnings were very true. This movie is not for those with queasy stomachs for there are a number of scenes which could make the average person puke. That is providing they are not edited out for this upcoming release. One being where Baron Frankenstein says, " to know life, one must F... the gallbladder" which he does after cutting open the female Frankenstein monster. The lopping off of a head with curved shears was a good one too. The fact that this movie was originally in 3D made for some good close ups of intestines and livers as well. Too bad the dvd will not be in 3d. As with most classic horrors, the acting is not deserving of any awards, but I believe that any collector of horror/gore flicks should cosider this movie+dvd
totally boring movie+N+This almost seemed like a silent film.  It was just so terrible and boring that I finally just shut it off not wanting to waste any more time. worthles+dvd
I am a B horror flick fan, but...+N+I thought that this movie fell short of even B horror flick standards. I did like the scenic shots of the film but the dialog and the "mutants" of this film didn't really hold my attention. The "mutants" were not even mutants at all. They looked like everyday people that you would see on the street. Well,  they didn't look disfigured is what I mean. The guy that was acting like he was part of the "Rap Culture" was the most irritating of them all. I really wanted to like this movie, but I am sorry that I didn't. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Even those B horror fans+dvd
ORALLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST NOVELAS I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS I WAS UP UNTIL 5AM+dvd
"The Fat Nothing"+N+Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger.+dvd
I've seen better+N+A high-school kid could make up a better story.  Watch out for the Liger!  Part Lion part Tige+dvd
Don't waste your time!+N+I ordered this dvd on the premise of viewing a great, seriously done, artistic, erotic film based on the reviews it had already. What I watched had to be the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen! Not only was the story line not complete (You basically have to assume a lot because it doesn't talk about the origin of the beast at all [what the hell was that, a werewolf?], but it also delves into comedy sometimes, unintentionally [like the idiotic screeming and running around of the girl near the end]). And the guy dressed in the beast costume, well, I guess they weren't that into special effects back then except for the "gallons" of ejaculate they used in the rape scene. Totally stupid! If this was great euro-sex of the 70's, I'll stay away from anything else produced by this guy. The best sex in here was at the beginning with the horses and then the servant getting it from the daughter (who they SHOULD have used in more of the scenes), but then it's all down hill from there. Thank God I only spent $9.99 on this crap! I don't even want to give this one star, but I guess I have to to get this submitted so I have to put it down :+dvd
Relevant and Thought-Provoking+P+Although this is an inaccurate adaptation of the original, it seems best to interpret this film on its own merit.  Those who have read the novel will find this difficult, but others are in for a treat.  Although somewhat shocking at first, this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing.  This film has aged well, given the current political climate and world events.  Here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of WWII and Cold War-styled propaganda.  Unfortunately, the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope.  Visually, the film is spectacular.  The score by Basil Pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best I have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks.  Despite this recommendation, I should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent, with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted.  An interesting aside, probably not well known outside Australia, is that Australian politician Pauline Hansen (One Nation) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the Federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign (accusations of fascist leanings by her critics)+dvd
"Jolly Good Show!"+P+Tommy and Tuppence are certainly my favorite Agatha Christie crime stoppers, and Francesca Annis and James Warwick give wonderful portrayals of the fun and brilliant pair.+dvd
Formulaic Saturday Morning Fare+N+If you're looking for something groundbreaking like B:TAS or "The New Batman Adventures," you'll have to look elsewhere. "The Batman" is nothing new. In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two "hipper" more "kid-friendly" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment.+dvd
Black Christmas is just a goofy gory version+N+When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer+dvd
"Turn the Sun Down": Teen summer fun cartoon with Daria.+P+I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it!   "Is It Fall Yet?" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: "The Tom Thing" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it.  Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating.  Tom and Jane have broken up.  This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane.    The two bonus episodes on the dvd ("Fire" and "Dye! Dye, My Darling!")  show how "The Tom Thing" happened.  It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie.   Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp.  Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated).  The other `Daria' characters have their own situations.  Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale.  Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool.  They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that.  Watch the movie, and see for yourselves!  Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams.  (How I remember my high school days!  I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!)  Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's "King of the Hill" series.  Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot!   Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'.  Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream.  His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work.  The pair doesn't have time to date.    I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the "Beach Blanket" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria.  The song "Turn the Sun Down", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the "Daria" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect.    Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series.  A somber Daria is at the movies.  Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. "Turn the Sun Down" is played in the background.     At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast.  There are a few gross outtakes also included.  "Is It Fall Yet?" got me interested in the "Daria" t.v. series.  To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head".  I purchased her "Daria Diaries" and "Daria Databases" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters.  I'm presently reading her `Diaries'.  And I, too, hope that the complete "Daria" series gets released on dvd in the very near future.        But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with "Is It Fall Yet?"  And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes.  A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria "Do you ever smile??"     The answer is Yes!  And this movie is sure to make you smile.  It's a gem in the "Daria" series!      +dvd
I love Miss Marple, but these DVD's don't do her  justice..+N+I watched all the Miss Marple's as my Mother &amp; I are big fans of Agatha Christie's many books. I watched the series when it ran years ago, and was looking forward with great anticiption to the DVD's. I must say this is the worst job of transferring a beautifully produced television series to DVD. There were so many artifacts from cramming everything onto single disks that they are in many cases, completely unviewable. I would recommend renting this set from Netflix or somewhere before purchasing them. This is such a major disappointment. I loved the series and waited with great anticipation for their release, only to discover they're unwatchable+dvd
Very disappointing+N+I was disappointed because there is no game footage, only conversations and instructional footage.  80% of this video is players interacting with Jennie Finch, and 50% of the video is Jenny Finch pitching to major leagers. +dvd
Great story if only the language was cleaner.+N+YIKES.. Saw this on TV a while back and there was no cussing.  Bought the DVD and wow, it was filled with it....way too much. But the story was very creative and would be a great family film if the language was cleaner.  Clean language would've earned a 5 star rating.+dvd
Make your own film+P+I hate people who complain that films don't have enough of some element, some band who they want to see. There are enough Oasis, Blur and Pulp videos out there to catch up on. There is John Harris' Britpop book. Britpop WAS a media invention. It is a tired subject. But it did happen. It is essential to talk about the Blur vs. Oasis thing at some point. I feel that this film succeeded at some point. There are another hour of interviews with the bands as a bonus. If you don't like this film, make your own. It will probably suck. It will probably have a thousand close shots of Jarvis Cocker. That is just fandom. That is monomania. That is not narrative filmmaking+dvd
A  Big Disappointment+N+After reading the 5 Star review on this DVD I purchased it hoping that if it even came close to this recommendation I would be overjoyed. Anyone if even faintly familier with classical piano has heard of Rubinstein who is certainly considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. Unfortunately he is not one of the great actors of the 20th century and this staged production done,I'm guessing for TV or the schoolroom,is truly pathetic. The film is dark and grainey and the fidelity is awful.  I know this was made in 1953 so what should I expect? Better than this.  There are some wonderful classical performances on DVD with supberb audio and video so maybe I'm spoiled. If your looking for a great recording of Rubinstein buy the Phillips Great Pianists of the 20th century 2 CD set. You won't be disappointed.      +dvd
"Rashomon" with music and beauties, energized by Kay Kendall+P+As several other reviewers have commented, this film, Gene Kelly's last musical with MGM, borrows its central conceit from Akira Kurosawa's immortal "Rashomon" - only this time, the central event isn't a murder, but a tangled love affair involving a song-and-dance man (Kelly) and his three gorgeous backups (Kendall, Mitzi Gaynor and Taina Elg) which becomes the subject of a media-magnet London lawsuit. The lovely, much-lamented Kendall's performance is the core of this movie (her drunken-opera scene is not to be missed!) but Elg, Gaynor and Kelly all turn in highly creditable work as well.+dvd
"Rocky" meets "An Officer and a Gentleman" earns a split decision+N+2 1/2 Stars.  There is nothing original in this story about a young man who is a disappointment to his father, has a problem with authority figures, and has yet to find his place in the world.  The plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache.  James Franco has good screen presence and he can act, although he is limited.  Tyrese Gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as Franco's antagonist.  He simply always looks like he's acting the entire time.  His character isn't even defined well and his reasons for going after Franco's character lacks sincerity and believability.  The direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that isn't sure what it want to be, so it tries very hard to be everything.  It wants to be a basic training kind of film a la "G.I. Jane" while also trying to be a sports film with its boxing substory.  It wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built.  It throws in everything else from race relations to father and son psycho-babble.  I was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown in for good measure.  The film was okay overall when all was said and done.  I had some fun with it and Franco is fun to watch.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it was glaringly not as good as it could have been.  While viewing this film one is liable to keep saying, "if they only did this" or "if they had only done that."  That leaves a bad taste in one's mouth+dvd
HORRIBLE WASTE OF TALENT!!!!+N+Where should I start...Anthony Quinn was incoherent and difficult to understand...someone put him out of his misery and have him retire already....Stalone...well the name speaks for itself...Madeline ... why oh why did you get mixed up in this project??? Has your career come to an end??  Sylvester is obviously, finally off the steriods, because in this movie, he was so thin and drawn.  He hardly had any muscle mass.  It did not look like him...is he wearing a wig in this movie?  One time box-office attractions got together and made this movie. WHY WHY WHY??? I want my money back, I want my 90 minutes of my life back.  G A R B A G E and jokes were very corny.  Stallone looked like he was sleeping half the time+dvd
This DVD is a MUST!!!! +P+I've been studying pilates and gyrotonics for six years with some of the top instructors in NYC but with the increasing popularity of pilates, the sessions have gotten absurdly expensive, which is why I wanted to try a DVD. I have never been one to work out in my home, but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have I saved so much money by doing this DVD instead of my beloved studio sessions, but I'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than I ever could with the sessions.   As the reviews before me have indicated, the DVD is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area, but I think that's slightly misleading. While about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under, each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well, which make for a more overall workout, whether you're doing one section or four at a time. For instance, in the section entitled "abs" you'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs. Therefore, you're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout!   ******NOTE:  I recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates, but NOT for beginners!!!  In order to do these exercises correctly, you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement, breathing techniques, and proper alignment. If you are attempting these exercises as a beginner, they may seem straightforward, but without the proper foundation and knowledge (which is NOT explained), you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse, could get hurt.*******  For those who are newer to pilates, I would recommend perhaps watching the video first, as it moves at what I would consider a fast intermediate pace.    +dvd
Not for Beginners, or anyone else+N+Attempting difficult poses, even modified versions, is a sure-fire way to discourage beginners from the practice, or make them feel inadequate, which is not what Yoga should cultivate. Even as an intermediate yoga practicioner, I did not like this tape, primarily because it throws you into the difficult poses without first generating sufficient heat in the body. The warm-up poses are minimal, static, and do not prepare your body sufficiently for the extensions and compressions of the advanced postures that follow. Besides all that, the instruction goes from excrutiating detail to not enough information (you have to break concentration and look to see what's going on) in the course of a single series of poses. Very frustrating. As if that weren't bad enough, the instructor's amazing flexibility is about the only inspiring aspect of the tape; her monotone delivery and the spare studio setting with no students make for a no fun experience+dvd
TRASH!  Had to choose at least 1 star but it is ZERO !+N+Bought this awhile back and forgot I had it. Watched it and then I rememebered how AWFUL it was. Was about to throw it out and then thought maybe I could reuse the case?+dvd
Great movie+P+Kill Bill - Volume 2 (UMD Mini For PSP) greta movie for the PS+dvd
A great movie but is it the same as the theatrical release?+P+I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.    The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.  At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.    I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.   On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.  So where is the version with the alternative ending???+dvd
No mention of Wicca in product description - why?+N+Why doesn't Amazon mention that this video talks about Wicca in their review or in their product description? I also looked at the video in a store, and there was no mention of Wicca on the case. That's important information to leave out. If it were there, consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children.+dvd
I wasted two hours of my precious life+N+This movie has NO plot! Yes, the characters say things and do things and things happene but that's not a plot! This movie wanders on aimlessly. What is it trying to say? What is the point? Brian J White is a good actor. I loved him in The Shield, but in this movie he OVER ACTS! It's like he has no talent at all. The white women in the film are stereotypes, especially the blonde. They played the same 2 or 3 pieces of music several times throughout the film whether they fit or not. One seemed to be played in every other scene. Whomever wrote this needs to try again! Or NOT+dvd
A weird movie+N+This film is one of the worst I have seen.  I really don't know what other films Sean Reid has produced but this one was kind of bad. The film opens up by saying it's based on true events, so you wonder is it based on Sean Reid's young life trying to pursue acting.  To me this film was pointless.  It's named Redemption, redemption from what?  It shows Christian, played by Brian White,  going through depressive pshycotic episodes trying to find his way in life. The only scenes I liked were between him and his father.  The conversations between them were very meaningful with Christian trying to get through to his father, which lets you in on his family history, and his father trying to help his son cope with life.  Christian is battling many demons; his father not being a good example in his life, his mother not being there, his struggle to pursue acting, and trying to find love.  This all leads to Christian making poor decisions.  He starts partying and getting in stupid fights.  He starts to take a turn for the worse when he meets this actor who can get him a gig and starts using marijuana.  One of his friends, the guy who plays Marlon, acts like a total jerk and disrepects women and his girlfriend puts up with it.  It was ridiculous.  Melique, another one of Christian's friends stops hanging with them when he sees that they are starting to make wrong decisions.  Realizing this, Christian finds Melique.  Melique tries to redeem Christian from himself by having a serious heart to heart talk with him.  You would think that since the movie is named "Redemption" that Christian at this point would turn his life around.  He does find hope again and wants to start a new life with his girlfriend (Claire).  It doesn't last long when Trent (a foe of his) spots him and beats him up.  Then the downward spiral begins again.  Christian starts getting high and starts having hallucinations.  He has a mental breakdown and starts doing strange things.  He think he sees Trent and goes out in a rage with a knife in his hand running around town half naked.  When the police officers can't get through to him he gets shot.    Overall this movie was bizarre and kind of a waste of time.  Some scenes didn't make sense and it was very overdramatic+dvd
lady in white+N+Not that attention-holding. Plot seemed to drag on too long before coming together,as best it could. Realism just never made it. Disappointing.+dvd
Come Back To The 5 and Dime, Pauline Kael, Pauline Kael+N+For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.  This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).   Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.    Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision+dvd
Faithful but dull+N+This made for TV Canadian adaptation of the Washington Irving story is more faithful than the Tim Burton movie. (Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version+dvd
Just Visiting+P+i loved it it was funny it had a good story line and i liked it so much i bought i+dvd
Also a Mingus fan and fellow bassist+N+High points and low points often in the same song.  Overall a pretty forgetable performance.  I found Jack Walrath's (trumpet) performance pretty inspiring, but George Adams (sax) came off as a way over the top and annoying.  I think I'll go listen to Mingus Ah Um right now to wash the taste out of my mouth+dvd
emotionally and dramatically flat and lifeless; set decoration is the only lively thing on display+N+Roland Joffe directed two masterpieces: The Killing Fields & The Mission. But those two films, directed in 1984 & 1986, were made twenty or more years ago. I'd recommend either of those two films to anybody but Vatel I would recommend only to those viewers who can enjoy a film for its look, its set design and its attention to period detail even when the story and characters themselves are not all that captivating.   Vatel is a film that should have everything going for it. As mentioned the director has at least two masterpieces to his credit, Tom Stoppard had a hand in the screenplay (more on that in a minute), Uma Thurman is beautiful, and Gerard Depardieu & Julian Sands & Tim Roth are each capable of delivering memorable performances when they feel inspired. The problem is no one feels inspired by this material. And that is in part due to a lackluster set of characters--supposedly based on actual people--and a story that never really manages to capture our imagination.  Gerard Depardieu as master steward "Vatel" is required by his boss, the gout-stricken Prince Conde aka General Conde, to arrange elaborate feasts and entertainments for a visiting retinue of royals that include King Louis XIV, his mistresses, his brother, and various advisors & handlers. If these feasts and entertainments succeed in capturing the kings fancy then Vatel's boss may receive the honor of commanding the French troops in a war with Holland (that may or may not happen). So virtually every frame of the film is dedicated to following Vatel as he personally oversees virtually every dish and set decoration before it is presented to the royal retinue. As viewers we are amazed by Vatel's ingenuity with everything from outdoor theatrical sets that resemble large fold-out books to his ability to make delicate lanterns out of vegetable gourds (Martha Stewart would be impressed) but our interest is purely aesthetic because we never really care whether the Prince gets his royal comission or not and we barely care about Vatel. Next to the selfish, scheming and utterly corrupt royals the selfless and earthy and incorruptible Vatel seems, well, selfless and earthy and incorruptible. Along with his many domestic and artistic talents Vatel also has an uncanny way of understanding people's true natures and needs better than they. The problem with Vatel is that he is perhaps too selfless and so while he busies himself with entertaining others his own life is virtually a non-event.   Uma Thurman plays a woman of precarious social standing. She is from a noble family but her position at court is not yet secure and like everyone else she must humor the King to assure his continued favor. When he suggests that they meet in private "for a cup of chocolate" she has no choice but to agree. She is under no illusion that she is anything but a temporary amusement for the King but to refuse the King's advances would be social suicide. The royal world sickens her and we are supposed to see her as somehow too earthy and real for court life but one problem is that this character is barely there. Uma just barely goes through the motions when she is onscreen; instead of seeming like she is dissatisfied with court life she just looks like she is dissatisfied with having to be in this royal dud of a picture. This is too bad because she is supposed to be the muse that awakens or re-awakens Vatel's long dormant passions but there is absolutely zero spark between Uma Thurman and Gerard Depardieu. When the obese fifty-something Depardieu kisses the thirty-something Uma we just don't get it. Few screen romances have ever felt so unconvincing and so void of passion and so uncomfortable to watch. We do know that Depardieu as Vatel is capable of feeling affection because he is very fond of his pet parrots but alas none of this affection is apparent when Uma Thurman is in frame. We're supposed to feel that its the rabid social competition of court life that reduces love to a mere game of conquest and that true love in such a world doesn't have a chance. Instead what we feel is that lack of chemistry between actors is what kills passion.  Since the Depardieu-Thurman romance doesn't manage to throw off even one spark the primary story-line is D.O.A. . The elaborate theatrical productions and fireworks displays might hold your attention for a few minutes but this film is not interesting enough to hold your attention for two hours.   Julian Sands does a pretty good job as King Louis XIV and Tim Roth an ok job as one of the kings advisors but neither of these actors are given anything very interesting to do or say. Though Tom Stoppard's name appears in the credits when you look closer you realize that Tom Stoppard didn't write an original screenplay rather he merely adapted a French text. Thus even though this film tries to ride on the coat tails of the Stoppard penned Shakespeare in Love this production does not have any of Stoppard's signature cleverness or wit.   +dvd
1 of the 8 films to die for...out of boredom!+N+I generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films, while trying to be cutting edge, usually smack of just "trying"...too hard.  I gave "The Hamiltons" a go since it received the most hype.  Wasn't impressed.  Yes, the ending has a nice little twist, and I was intrigued by seeing Lenny--although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming--the film lacks dramatic tension, contains mundane dialogue (victim: "help me"; predator [whining]: "I can't!), and characters are pretty much stock caricatures. 86 minutes drrrraggged by. +dvd
100% No Doubt!!!!+P+There are absolutey NO negatives about this DVD.  Just keep in mind, that the videos are all No Doubt and not Gwen Stefani solo.  This is one of the best video collections I've purchased, and as for 5 stars, the DVD ranks closer to 10. +dvd
Awful!+N+I was astounded that a major studio/star cast could make such a worthless film. The plot is as old as the hills: innocent  man  wrongfully convicted of murder awaits excecution on death row - innocent man is saved at the last minute by the good guy(s). This movie gives you cheating wives, cheating husbands, irresponsible fathers, paper thin plot, superficial characters, and boring dialog. I totally lost my respect for Clint Eastwood after viewing this - and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of my all time favorite films! How can a person be so inconsistent? (I think I know the answer; it's called &quot;a slump.&quot;+dvd
Great Practical Information for the Player+P+John Petrucci is obviously a master of his craft, and not all masters are able to effectively pass on their knowledge. Petrucci, however, can and does in this instructional video. I have owned this in all its forms, have used the techniques, and refer back to it frequently. It is much easier to do that with the DVD format. If used, these exercises WILL improve your playing+dvd
"To my liberation from the class enemy!"+P+Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) is one of a group of West German terrorists who spring fellow terrorist, Andrea (Harald Schrott) from jail. Several people are shot during the jailbreak, and the group goes on the lam to Paris. While in Paris, Rita kills a policeman, and the terrorists are once again on the run--this time they slip into East Germany with the help of Stasi officer Erwin Hull (Martin Wuttke) who befriended Rita when she was recognized upon entering East Berlin before. Since the heat is on the group, Erwin makes an offer--the terrorists can accept a new life--with new identities in East Germany, or they can be flown out to Beirut. While everyone else elects Beirut, Rita decides to stay in East Germany.   Rita assumes a new identity in East Germany, and her adjustment to her environment is at the heart of "The Legend of Rita" from director Volker Schlondorff. The plot places Rita in some interesting situations. Her first job, for example, is in a factory where she befriends Tatjana (Nadja Uhl). Tatjana loathes East Germany, and would love to live in the West. She can't understand why Rita (now living under an assumed name) would give up Western freedoms and chose to live under Communist rule. In the meantime, Rita's former rebelliousness against the state has simply disappeared, and she's become a drone--speaking the party line and accepting whatever she's told to do. When Rita's new identity is threatened, she has little choice but to move on--leaving Tatjana and their budding lesbian affair.   The film fails to fulfill its promise, however, on several layers. Rita becomes a pawn for the Stasi--every move she makes is watched, and every conversation she has is taped. The film could have chosen to tackle some fascinating complex arguments--Rita's ideology, for example, and the challenge she faces in either rejecting her beliefs or sticking to them in the face of such nauseating, and threatening Orwellian bureaucracy. The plot shows Rita as mindlessly accepting what she is told to do--she doesn't question her freedoms, and by making Rita a drone, she is a far less interesting character. Instead, the film concentrates on Rita's two love interests. Also, if you are expecting to discover something about the Red Army Faction (RAF) here, keep looking. This is not a film about the RAF. There is an excellent book by Stefan Aust on the subject, but it's rare to find a copy in English. I recommend "How It All Began" By Bommi Baumann and "Televisionaries: The Red Army Faction Story 1963-1993" by Tom Vague. "The Legend of Rita" is worth watching for all fans of German film out there. Overall, the film's message argues strongly against aligning oneself with any political ideals. In German with English subtitles--displacedhuma+dvd
Just delicious!  +P+This is one of my favorite movies! Tom Ewell is a hoot as Richard Sherman, a man with an overactive imagination. We don't believe him for a minute when he swears to himself he is not going to smoke, drink, etc. while his wife and son are away because we know he doesn't have the will power. He really wants these things, yet seven years of marriage has ingrained his wife's nagging into his conscience. His wife's voice is always there and he is now no longer able to go through a day and complete simple tasks without constantly grappling with himself for permission. And then Marilyn Monroe moves in upstairs for the summer. Is there no mercy? Monroe and Ewell are great, Wilder keeps up the pace and the supporting parts are spot-on. Wonderful! The picture has been restored and is presented widescreen, so you cannot go wrong.+dvd
Great Workout Video!!!+P+This video is really great. I have been using it for a month now and I'm having great results. It's easy to do every day. Helped me get back into shape quickly after having my baby+dvd
Not worth your money!!+N+I found this version at the library and decided to check it out. I was amazed at how bad it was. For one thing, they changed the story around which was bothersome. The singing is really bad, and I think the thing that that bothered me the most is the strange costumes (Tamino looks like an elf!) I also hated all the strange creatures that come out, instead of animals coming out when Tamino plays his flute, they have people prancing out on stage dressed as who knows what. The whole thing was just horrible, costumes, the set, everything...and a lot of times when the commentator is explaining a certain part, it'll be playing a whole different aria (or the wrong part of the aria.) The whole thing is so chopped up, and the DVD is more blurry and grainy than I've ever seen anything on DVD before. I wouldn't buy it or even waste yout time getting it from the library. You're better off buying a REAL production on DVD of the Magic Flute for your kids, such as the one at the Met with Kathleen Battle.+dvd
Based on real-life+P+The title of this movie refers to the widow Mrs. Henderson, a rich member of England's upper crust at the beginning of WWII.  Having lost a husband years earlier, and a son to WWI, she needs something to do, and so buys the Windmill Theater in London.  Pouring her money into it and pulling some political strings, she turns it into a first class theater that runs shows with young, beautiful, nude women in it.  Her aim, to entertain young English lads before they are sent of to war.  This she does, but various tragedies strike along the way, such as one of her "actresses" getting pregnant by a married soldier.    This DVD set includes several features, one of which is the story of the real theater and interviews with actual actresses who worked there.  Yes, this movie is based on real-life events and people, and it seems the producers went out of the way to make the movie as historically true as possible.  All in all, this movie is a great combination of history, tragedy, and comedy, and worth watching+dvd
There's No Time To Change Your Mind...+N+The 1st 2 flicks have come on gone...World at War gets LEFT BEHIND(pun intended). I hoped I'd never see the day when I'd have to give an attempted prophecy movie thumbs down, but here we have it. To keep it short and sweet, many of the same characters are present from the 1st 2 films(which were true to the book), however, this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book 3, as Cloud 10 veers away from the continuum of the book series. It's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together. Definately not a keeper...stick to the first 2 and then add The Moment After and SIX:The Mark Unleashed to your collection instead.+dvd
embarrassing+N+Seldom has so much talent (and MONEY!) been wasted on such unentertaining silliness.  Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins--it is painful to watch them cope with the bad writing, overemoting, over-elaborate (and dull) sets, and just general aimlessness of this picture.  Everybody works REALLY hard, and the strain shows.  The fun seems forced, the situations pointless, the message ham-handed, and the music--oh, my goodness--the music is the most syruppy mess this side of "Pearl Harbor."  Even the special effects are less than special.  All in all, very uncomfortable to sit through+dvd
Terrific Series+P+From BBC,another terrific series.  As good as Prime Suspect, it's about the on-going core characters - all with their own psychological quirks, strengths and weaknesses as well as the crimes they need to solve. Great acting, writing.  Suspenseful. Now waiting for series 3, 1 & 2 are definately keepers+dvd
Not for beginners+N+This is strictly a demostration DVD with no verbal instructions. It might be good for others, but I did not benefit from it+dvd
Has good twists and turns but the acting is bad+N+A typically early 90's thriller like Basic Instinct, Fatel Attractiona nd Indecient Praposel. This film works in soem levels and then falls in more levels. The good parts in the film is the twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The bad stuff is the terriable acting from everyone in the film. It's not entirelly bad and worth to see for the twist and turns but that's it+dvd
EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA+N+THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO.      THANK YOU.+dvd
I'm rating the actual DVD not the movie+N+I LOVE this movie I've seen it probably more than 100 times! So imagine how excited I was to see it for like 5 bucks at Wal-Mart.... this particular copy is sitting next to me right now and all can say is I was really mad when I sat and watched it, the editing is horrible there are times when the camera zooms on people it shouldn't, lines are cut out and sometimes there are voices but no one's lips are moving.  Buy the authorized version not this one this one sucks+dvd
It's good, but not great.  +P+John Wayne, a legendary hero.  This box set has some good movies, I really liked the Westerns, but the rest of the movies I didn't care for.  Unless you're really into John Wayne this might be one Box Set you may want to rent rather than buy. +dvd
Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd+P+Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreem format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended+dvd
Almost, but not quite.+N+As a fan of the Coen brothers I was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good.  The snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here.  The wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp.   Add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it's a swing and a miss.  This movie seems less like a Coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways+dvd
The funniest skit I've ever seen+P+This DVD contains quintessential Monty Python skits, with spam all over the place.  But, this review focuses on one skit on this DVD, which is the skit that made me laugh more than anything else I've ever seen.   The Hungarian phrasebook is skit is basic on a simple premise:  Hungarian immigrants to England need English translations of basic phrases needed in everyday life.  But, sinister forces are afoot, and a not-so-innocent phrasebook is published.  The skit shows the devastating effects of this nefarious deed, as John Cleese portrays a proper Hungarian gentleman going into a tobacconist's shop and . . . I don't what to spoil it.  But, the end result had me laughing until I cried.   *da dolphin boy ponders a similar dolphin-human phrasebook, but rejects the idea as potentially fatal to human-cetacean relations+dvd
fulcis blood drenched classic+P+lucio fulcis zombi 2 is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn of the dead is a close second]and should be in every horror fans collection. people say that its a rip off of romeros films, but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead. romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre. fulcis picture is actually quite original. the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective. the zombies look amazing, much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers. fulcis zombies are rotting, decaying monsters. each one has its own original qualities. the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing. it takes like 40 minutes for the film to get going, but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest. speaking of gore, zombi 2 has plenty of it. the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film. if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly.+dvd
Kathy Smith fan...+N+I have several Kathy Smith videos & never minded the outdated clothes, hair, or music because of the quality of the workout. I've tried newer more popular videos every year & found the instructors prissy and their routines contrived. I'm a big fan of Kathy's style and she never failed to deliver a truly effective workout that left me soaked w/sweat & ready to do it again the next day. Having said that, this video SUCKED!! When I got pregnant I immediately sought out Kathy's video among all the other pregnancy fitness choices and was sorely disappointed. I think my grandmother could handle this routine on fast-forward!! I get more worked up doing my dishes than this video!! I've resorted to just doing my favorite Kathy Smith step video without the step instead+dvd
Quaint and Silly.+N+There is a case for decrepit cinematic 'crud' being universal. This is it. Get Ozu's &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; instead (out on Criterion). That is a piece of timeless lyrical cinema. This film merely confirms that risque cinema quickly loses its potency (losing it in favour of a ephemeral revolutionary stance). A Waste+dvd
Just ok+P+I guess I am jaded because I watched the IMAX Everest video (which seems to get the best reviews) first and can't help but compare them.  Still this video had some good participants i.e. Ed Viestur's and such.  Interesting view point but the testing didn't do much for me but provide information.  Would have liked more extra's on dvd to.  All in all ok.+dvd
Bad lessons :(+N+These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD+dvd
Do 15 minutes make a movie great?+N+The answer is a big NO!  After the first 15 minutes of this movie, which don't get me wrong were quite awesome, the movie completely tanks at all levels. The movie was set in a mall, but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival, NO! I read an interview with the Director of this movie, and when asked about setting the movie in a mall, the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine.  Now look, when you're using the title, "Dawn of the Dead", you better remake it great, I mean really great.  The followers of Romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the GP.  You know, I might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different.  Definately not when the same.  If you want to see really good Zombie movies, watch the original Romero trilogy, 28 Days Later, the Lucio Fulci trilogy, or even the Return of the Living Dead.  Heck, even the Resident Evil movies easily out did this stinker.  Don't waste your time or money+dvd
Film Has Some Merit Despite Some Flaws+P+I enjoyed this film very much.  It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet.  How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo.  What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters.  In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy.  Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible.  If it is true that gay people look for "looks in a person first" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth.  I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him.  One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward.  Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation?  It is a common occurrence in the gay community.  Another implausibility is the "coming out on a talk show" with a near "Jenny Jones" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David.  One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend.  John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack.  The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last.  Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo?  I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society.  However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way.  Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years.  Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo.  This film is worth a look.  +dvd
5 stars for the film, 1 for this DVD release+N+I've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on DVD and was so disappointed to discover it's only available in a full-screen format. For those who don't know the difference, this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format, so to make it fit the traditional square television, they had to crop out a lot of the picture. What's more, this "restored" version contains no documentaries--only trailers and cast lists. I e-mailed Sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time. What a shame! The film was released on VHS in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the DVD release. If you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release, don't buy this chopped-up version. Save your money and watch the VHS or widescreen airings on Turner Classic Movies. Eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better DVD+dvd
NOT Stoker's Dracula+N+I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.  If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him+dvd
My little Thomas fan loves this DVD!+P+My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them. They are his favorite and I don't think that will change for a very long time. Thomas provides great life lessons like sharing, caring, and friendship. They get a thumbs up from me as well!+dvd
Too scary for children+N+All the Care Bear merchandise is heavily marketed to preschool aged children but these "original" DVD's from the 80's are far from appropriate for that age group due to the evil scary content in every episode. The new care bear movie "Journey to Joke-a-Lot" is much more appropriate for young children+dvd
awesum+P+if your not into sick humour dont buy this. but if you like your humour to the extreme this is something for you. tom green directed this movie so if u like what he usually does. then yeah. u wil love this. i love i+dvd
&quot;To fight fascism you have to be a communist.&quot;+P+One of the most notorious espionage stories of the 20th century involves several members of Britain's upper crust. While Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, and Donald MacLean attended Trinity College, Cambridge, in the 1930s, they were recruited as spies by the Soviet government. All of the men subsequently gained prestigious jobs and successfully passed secrets to the Russians for several decades. The four-hour television mini-series, &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, concentrates on the characters of the spies, and how the society they were part of allowed them to flourish.     The film begins with Trinity College, Cambridge in the 1930s. Hitler's power is on the rise, and fascism manages to impress a certain segment of the British upper classes. In response to the rise of fascism, many are attracted to communism. Blunt and Burgess are members of an elite club--the Apostles--and they are both committed communists when they meet and become involved with Donald MacLean and Kim Philby. The four men form a tight bond, which remains even after they leave university. Philby and Burgess both held high positions in MI6, and MacLean became a diplomat. Blunt--a distant relative to the royals--was knighted and became the Royal Curator of Art for the Queen.     &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; succeeds in showing how these men were attracted to communism in the first place. They all came from wealthy, privileged backgrounds, and involvement with communism was a reaction against that, and also a reaction against fascism. The film shows the political and social atmosphere in which the &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; made their commitment to communism. The film is also extremely successful in showing the 'old boy network' that existed, and which, in effect managed to protect the spies. They were simply beyond suspicion and beyond reproach.    Guy Burgess (Tom Hollander in an amazing performance) is a volatile extrovert with a penchant for self-destruction. Kim Philby (Toby Stephens) is much more controlled, and he seems the more rational of the bunch. MacLean (Rupert Penry-Jones) is another loose cannon, and Blunt (Samuel West) enjoys his connection with his royal relatives far more than he anticipated. While I deplored the misguided actions of the spies, it seems quite plausible that at least two of the four men (Blunt and Burgess) lived to really regret their youthful decision to convert to communism. But they found themselves stuck in a lifetime commitment before they realised the consequences. Blunt and Burgess seemed to truly love England, and their involvement with the Soviet government is sadly ironic.    &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; is really is an incredible story. The plot sticks more or less to the truth--although some details are not quite accurate. The most glaring deviation concerns the defection of Guy Burgess. DVD extras include a documentary, and there's also a 'scrapbook' with TV tidbits about each of the spies--displacedhuman +dvd
Awful+N+If you want to find out about Evel Knievel avoid this garbage.  I don't own it but I saw most of it on tv and was appalled.  George Eads was not too bad a choice but they could have found someone better.  And what's with the peeing scenes?  What kind of a statement were they trying to make????  I never did see the ending of it...it was that lousy.  It's a complete disaster. Someone needs to do a big motion picture about Evel Knievel like they did about Muhammed Ali.  The best actor I can think of is Matthew McConaughey as Evel. +dvd
Pure Garbage. One of the worst movies ever +N+You want to learn about Evel Knievel but you don't with this film. Awful.+dvd
"I'm in print!"+P+Navin Johnson is an idiot.  He was adopted and raised by black sharecroppers in Mississippi.   Navin loves his family but he feels he doesn't fit in.  His family all has rhythm, but he doesn't.  So, on his 18th birthday he leaves to discover the rest of the world. After hitching a few rides he ends up in St. Louis working and living at a gas station.  My favorite scene in the entire movie happens there.  The new phone books arrive and Navin gets all excited.  "This is the kind of spontaneous publicity--your name in print--that makes people.  I'm in print!  Things are going to start happening to me now."  That scene is priceless.  While at the gas station Navin invents a device for a man's glasses that later makes Navin a billionaire.  But, before that happens he gets shot at by a crazy sharpshooter, gets a job at a traveling carnival, meets a biker chick, breaks up with the biker chick, and fall in love and marry the woman of his dreams, Marie Kimble (Bernadette Peters).  Of course, Navin ends up loosing everything and that's why he's a jerk.  THE JERK wasn't Steve Martin's first movie, but it was his first starring role in a feature film and introduced the style of comedy he was doing on the comedy circuit to a broader audience.  The movie is filled with all kinds of jokes from witty one-liners, poop jokes, sexual innuendo, slapstick, and a lot of crazy nonsense.  There were moments of THE JERK that I really enjoyed, but there was a lot of stuff that was just plain stupid.  Of course, there's a lot of material in the film that no one would be able to get away with today.  Steve Martin always was more than just a "Wild and Crazy Guy."  He's an intellectual at heart and one can see snippets of that side of Martin in THE JERK. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by the type of comedy Martin was doing on the comedy circuit that appealed mainly to teenagers and college students.  Actually, the reason I ended up liking THE JERK wasn't because of Martin at all, it was because of Bernadette Peters.  Peters is one of the finest actresses of all time--she can do serious drama or slapstick comedy and do it better than any other actress.  She's a classy lady with a broad charm.  Martin is the star of THE JERK, but the film would not have been able to stand if it wasn't for Peters.  THE JERK is a must-see movie for Martin or Peters fans.  It's also a movie that people who enjoy lowbrow humor will probably like.  The film's largest audience at the time it was released was college students and teenagers.  Twenty-five years that core audience probably hasn't changed much+dvd
On the Edge of the Abyss+P+For thirteen tense days in October, 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  The Soviets had placed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.  These missiles were capable of striking much of the United States and Latin America.  Alerted to the presence of the missiles by a U-2 spy plane photograph, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and the joint chiefs of staff begin to chart a course to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.  The movie is told through the eyes of Presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  Aside from Costner's obviously fake Bostonian accent, the design works quite well.  By telling the story through O'Donnell's eyes, it allows the viewer to focus more on JFK, RFK, and the development of the crisis.    Directed by Costner as well, the movie describes the entire crisis, from start to finish. From the first discovery of the missiles by the U-2, through the agonizingly long two weeks of decisions and negotiations, to the final outcome, this movie covers all the bases.  I do wish that more attention would have been paid to the Soviet side of the crisis.  I believe that the film would have been more complete had this occurred.  The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Bruce Greenwood gives a compelling and exciting performance as John F. Kennedy, while Steven Culp is equally as good as JFK's younger brother Bobby.  Costner himself is again at his best as O'Donnell, and Michael Fairman does a wonderful job as the embattled Adlai Stevenson, who stands up to the Soviets at the U.N. with his famous "hell freezes over" quote.  I give this movie my highest recommendation. October, 1962 was a tense time for the world, and this great movie does a fine job of depicting the missile crisis.  As with its earlier predecessor "The Missiles of October", this film describes exactly how close the world came to nuclear war.   +dvd
Completely Skippable+N+Our two year old loves the TV shows & his Wiggles CDs, but he is not interested in this DVD.  It is simply songs strung together, with little or no dialog and no plot (which our child really enjoys, and frankly, makes it easier for me to sit through, strange as that may sound).  Most songs are performed on the same basic set, which is just a sky & clouds background. Also, as many reviewers have said, the puppets are terrible. I think they will give ME nightmares. They are AWFUL!!+dvd
Very Disappointing!+N+I bought this hoping it would be a thorough historical, architectural and artistic explanation of Chartres, and it really provides very little of such information.  It's mostly an hour of repetitive visual shots accompanied by chants.  Really a waste of money+dvd
Not great+N+I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it+dvd
The most romantic movie ever!!!+P+Somewhere in Time is by far the most transcendant romantic movie I have ever seen. It is old. Christopher Reeve made it before we knew him as Superman; Jane Seymour was his co-star. Reeve had just graduated college when a very old woman approaches with a gift. From then on it is breathtaking, following a time-travel episode that moves the story forward to an unforgetable conclusion, which does not really conclude in your memory! There is also a soundtrack of the movie with the most hauntingly beautiful music I have ever heard. I wouldn't be without either. You will love this movie and the music+dvd
My review on Exorcism of Emily Rose +P+Exorcism of Emily Rose is such a great movie! It's well put together. The cast is amazing! This movie is worth buying and watching over and over.  Fatima+dvd
the human swamp...+P+I love Frost, and its not just because it almost sounds like Frog. "Frost" is a great crime series, which, in stark contrast to almost every mainstream American detective show, refuses to glamorize either criminals or the people who pursue them. Rather than wrapping up every crime into nice black and white labels or a tidy little paradox, "Frost" leaves the viewer with a sobering sense for the dissonances and crises that afflict every the body politic. But what I love most is the wondering dismal grey Denton atmosphere. I can almost imagine I'm back in the swamp+dvd
Pornographic trash+N+Think this is a 'fun' sampler of B movies? Think again. Contains offensive pornography. Not terribly sexually explicit but full of violent and degrading situations. I feel guilty giving it 1 star, but that was the lowest rating available+dvd
Amazing Story+P+The hero of New Jersey, short for Bull Dog wins the Boxing World Championship, in a miracle comeback story.   The movie depicts the often fatal business of boxing.  Each year about 200 boxers die.   The commissioner does not want Braddock to fight Baer telling him that it will be a suicide fight.  Braddock tells the commissioner that he risks death every day he works on the docks and Boxing is the business he knows best.   Baer has killed three men in the ring with his power right cross that separates the brain from the spinal cord.  The commission shows Braddock, on film, the last Baer fight and Braddock watches carefully as Baer kills a man in the ring.  Braddock is the underdog, smaller and older, and Baer does not want to fight Braddock.   Braddock strategy is to sidestep and swipe Baers left hand out of the way.  In the end Braddock ends up in a fist to fist punch out with Baer for 15 rounds.  Braddocks ribs hold up and he wins the fight by judge decision.   The movie gives hope for the common man, the Irish Catholic, and thoses suffering from the Great depression.  Braddock is characterizes as one having emmense courage, appreciation of his country, and hope that America will be great.    Braddock must fight to survive, keep his family together, and survive the meat market of professional boxing+dvd
The end of a great show begins.+N+THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.   It amuses me that "fans" are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago.  THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it did.  As a fan, I was insulted.  Perhaps these other "fans" have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage.  +dvd
Highly Suspect+N+Due to the fact that no one has EVER landed on the moon. I saw a movie about this and one of them was "moon movie" and its for all to see that we NEVER landed on the friggin moon. So this guy really is getting a good yank here..+dvd
A LESSON TO REMEMBER...+P+This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.   They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.  The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.   Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.  While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation. Still, the film manages to entertain, notwithstanding these shortcomings+dvd
Pretty Bad Movie+N+Brokedown Palace is bad.  How bad is it?  It's pretty bad, man.  Don't tell me I didn't warn you+dvd
Noir heist film!+P+John Huston's noir-thriller is also a heist movie.  When Doc (Sam Jaffe) gets out of prison, he has a plan for the big heist.  He needs financial backing and a crew to help him.  Dix (Sterling Hayden) is the muscle, Gus (James Whitmore) the driver, and Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is the financial backer.    Dix is an embittered man whose dream is to buy back the farm his family lost.  Doc is a cool customer, genial and intellectual, and always has a plan.  Emmerich has a sick wife at home and a hot blonde (Marilyn Monroe) at his cottage by the river.  However, crime doesn't pay and each person's vice is their undoing.    This is a fine suspenseful thriller set in gorgeous, highly-contrasted black-and-white.  The presence of shadows in each scene and the violent pessimistic script give this film a noir sensibility.  Well directed and acted, this film also gives a true flavor of the 1950's. +dvd
Less Enjoyable Than "Coffy"+N+What seemed to have worked so well in "Coffy" just doesn't here. Yes, we get to see Pam Grier, and she's fine, but the script just doesn't give her a whole lot to do. Furthermore, the villain in this one just isn't scary, with her overwrought lines and lame "I'm in charge" banter; the sleazeball from "Coffy" was better because we didn't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end. That tension is missing here, save for one scene where Grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way. We actually get to feel a little tension.  However, I still feel that this below-average "follow-up" is more than a little disappointing, especially since "Coffy" really set a high bar, with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists. See this only if you just need to watch another Grier vehicle because it's just not as good+dvd
F Troop+P+Another "must buy" box set along with numerous other American TV shows (a list too long to mention). I live in the UK and the TV stations here seem reluctant to show classic TV even with the advent of satellite/cable. I used to be very envious of American viewers who had access to TV Land, however I now see that they no longer show classic shows from the 60's preferring to now stick to shows from the 80's onwards. I purchased Season 1 when it was released and laughed from start to finish, even my wife who never saw the original limited run of the show enjoys watching it and laughs just as much as myself.  I can't remember much about season 2 although I will when I watch the DVD, one thing I do remember is that it was very funny and would recommend anyone to purchase it+dvd
Great dialog exchange!+P+The story is only so-so but the exchanges between John Wayne and Kathryn Hepburn are wonderful and make the movie worth seeing. This had the potential to be really good+dvd
I miss them all!+P+I miss the whole cast and then some. When I found out the box set was out, I purchased it in a heart beat. I am waiting for box two. If you have never seen the series, this is the best way to start. Get the chance and explore as Seaquest did+dvd
Too much to cover in too short a time+N+This DVD functions more or less as an advertisement for the other SNL DVDs that have been and continue to be marketed by NBC. The 25th anniversary special on this DVD lasts 2.5 hours, which sounds like a long time, but it's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time. As uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year, there was still a lot of great material--far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way. As a result, the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites--often, just enough to cover a famous quote ("wild an crazy guys," etc.) with a touch of lead-in. This may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who's seen the skits, but that's about it. When the skits were originally aired, they usually went on too long, but here the DVD's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction. I'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of 25 years worth of programming that would fit on one DVD, but if it can't be done... maybe one shouldn't do it.   The DVD comes with three "extras": an interview of Lorne Michaels by Tim Russert, which is mildly interesting; the "day-after" coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous TV show I never heard of, "Access Hollywood"; and promotional TV coverage by some other NBC news show, which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the DVD. Again I ask: Why put this material on a DVD? The so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party.  All in all, disappointing.   By the way, for those who care, the Beastie Boys don't actually perform a number on the DVD. They play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by Elvis Costello, and then they end up playing back-up for him+dvd
ORGAZMO+N+dumb movie with some funny moments, a pot head would definitely appreciate this flic+dvd
For Lee/Dracula Completists Only+N+Jess Franco has to be one of the worst directors out there. He's managed to take a great story, hire a terrific cast, set them in interesting locations and still make a mess of the film. He uses a zoom lense at every opportunity, his day for night photography is a joke and the whole thing moves at a snail like pace.The only reason to have this movie is if you are a Christopher Lee or Bram Stoker fan and even then only as an interesting curiosity.The one thing it has going for it is the fact that there are more of Stokers actual dialogue spoken in this than any other Dracula film+dvd
Tsukamoto can do better.  Much better.+N+I like Shinya Tsukamoto.  He's a great director (TOKYO FIST), a talented actor (ICHI THE KILLER) and an imaginative writer (TETSUO), but I didn't care for A SNAKE OF JUNE.  It starts out alright with a repressed wife being blackmailed to act out her own sexual fantasies - example: walking around in public in a miniskirt with an active sex toy inside her.  That part was interesting, but then it starts going on about her lame husband and I lost interest quick.   Nowhere near sexy enough or surreal enough to recommend+dvd
Gay Puree DVD+P+This is an old movie and my daughter rented it all the time form the local video store on VHS.  The store eventually removed it from their rentals.  We were thrilled to find it in DVD form from Amazon+dvd
Haiku + .45 Semi Automatic = Hana Bi+P+Simply stated, the most important film of the 1990's; probably of the last twenty years.  The film is in its entirety a meditative experience, combining a slow and calm build-up of chi or prana-force-energy with explosive violence.  Beat Takeshi's violence, however, is not gratuitous, but righteous anger in action.  As a schizoid world falls down around him, Takeshi takes the role of Samurai -- indeed, "such a man was already Samurai."  This is a film of mystery, of soft color and light ocean breezes from the South China Sea, and of poetry.  If the warrior immortalized in Book of Five Rings or Gitopanishad has an equivalent in modern times, surely it would be in this strange character, this Japanese-style Colonel Kurtz in Hana-Bi.  But then, you must watch this film for yourself.  You will not be the same person when it is over+dvd
Beverly Hills Cop III+N+Beverly Hills Cop III~ Eddie Murphy is not a terrible movie. Then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment. Eddie Murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas. The plot is paper thin, and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies. Man, I was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies. This is a mediocre movie at best and gets the 2 stars that it deserves. Not recommended.+dvd
Best cartoon ever made - From lost era of morals, spinal ownership and legal masculinity+P+Imagine a cartoon series that teaches your kids respect of elders, doing homework, saying your prayers at night, bite-sized science lessons, respecting other cultures and people while at the same time actually killing the bad guys instead of worrying about offending them.  Welcome to Johnny Quest - A journey into TestosteroneLand where men are men, boys are boys, bad guys get killed and women are nowhere to be found.  This cartoon series is about as conservative as a cartoon can be.  You will NOT see this box sitting on the movie shelf at your liberal friend's house.  For example, attacking crocodiles get repelled with gunfire, bad guys get shot (dead), the key scientist has morals (and prefers to be armed), and ex-military bodyguards protect the kiddies by using bullwhips to crack scorpions into pieces.  Also, Dr. Beton Quest is prone to tell the boys to pray when science eventually fails to come to the rescue.  Jetpacks, hovercraft, jets, monsters, ray guns, scientific experiments, military action (tanks vs robots), bad guys, soldiers and police (being portrayed accurately in a positive light!), prehistoric beasts, cavemen, Natzi war criminals getting punished, etc.  Imagine the government only relying on REAL scientists who examine things through actual experiments and resulting data - not politicians pushing junk science like global warming, totally ignoring the millions of metric tons of greenhouse gasses and solid particulates volcanoes release and how it was warm enough for the Vikings to grow crops in Greenland 1,000 years ago.  I would have paid hundreds of dollars for this DVD set.  PS:  You might be interested to know that the title of this product is mispeading, as there was never a second season of Johnny Quest, and thus, there will be no additional DVD sets of the original Johnny Quest - this is all there is.  The original 1st-season 26 shows on this DVD set were actually stretched out over two seasons when it aired in 1964-65.  These 26 episodes are all that were ever made.  The show was also hugely successful, but the production costs (this kind cartoon-making was unprecidented at the time) killed the series.  Race Bannon for President+dvd
Fun trash+P+A documentary film crew on the Amazon River finds itself shanghaied into a crazy river rat's (Jon Voight) quest to capture a giant anaconda.  "Moby Dick," it ain't.  But it is a lot of fun, with smart writing, some good thrills, decent special effects, and quirky performances.  Voight, in particular, is hugely entertaining as he steps right up to the line between acting and mugging for the camera and remains precariously balanced there for the length of the film+dvd
future dystopia+P+Excellent film. It explores the inefficiencies of bureaucracy and paints a bleak picture of a police state, which seems ever more realistic. The acting is fantastic and the ideas presented in this movie are second to none. If you like this movie, also check out A Scanner Darkly and Logan's Run+dvd
Sorry, but I'm not falling for it+N+I don't know what Walmart these girls came from, but the ones I've been to only seem to staff homely, short, fat, goblin-like women. I smell a deception here. There's absolutely NO WAY IN H*LL that girls which look like this would have such a job. You'd find them working at espresso booths or something, where all the babes seem to be.  I think in this case PLayboy is appealing to our "fantasies" of seeing "regular girls from Walmart-type jobs" naked, but they couldn't possibly have found such quality at one of the actual stores.+dvd
This is not &quot;Drunken Master&quot;+N+don't buy this movie... this is NOT drunken master. the two fellas who gave this 5 stars had to be thinking of the REAL drunken master. i bought this w/o previewing it and saw that Jackie Chan wasn't in the movie at all, it was a crappy movie and then all of a sudden they'd squeeze in a jackie chan clip out of nowhere. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. don't make the same mistake that i did. instead, try &quot;young master&quot; with subtitles+dvd
Bad movie+N+This has to be Dolph's suckiest movie.  I'm a huge fan, and I own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis.  But do not buy this movie, save your money and buy one of Dolph's better movies like Army of one or Men of War.  Personally though I'm pumped for the release of masters of the Univers+dvd
Sucks+N+If you want the same old, bang bang rob the bank, movie then go ahead and by this low brow movie.  Take it from me it sucks+dvd
Superb+P+This is a great 2 act and a requiem play, and Dustin and the cast do a superb job. However, it still doesn't equal Lee J. Cobbs' portrayal of this delusional salesman and his last years of justification of his life. I would like to see the version with Frederic March as Willy. I am sure this scenario about the trials and tribulation of Willy Loman are carried out in the real world, more times than we really know. Overall, a fantastic story by Arthur Miller and worth 5 stars all the way+dvd
Will film critics stop praising how glorious Tarantino is!!!+P+Yes, this movie is awe-inspiring, awesome (I'm running out of adjectives here, lol) but will certain film critics (Roger Ebert I hope you read this) stop going around and saying how everything with dark humor, odd narrative, talky dialogue, etc., is Tarantino-esque?? Without Godard writing the blueprint on how to be a film essayist, there wouldn't be a Tarantino-esque (QT also owes a lot to Elmore Leonard, Scorsese, DePalma, and blaxploitation.). If I read one more review from overrated critic Ebert about how Tarantino paved the way for filmmakers that have a Godardian bite to their films, I might kill myself, lol  He never says how great of an influence Godard had on Tarantino. Nor does any other critics say how Godard's "Breathless" created modern cinema. Its as though these critics totally ignored Godard's methods, and pretend geeks like Tarantino created them. Shame on you Ebert.  That's like saying Christina Aguilera created that soulful yet high-scale histeronic singing she does, when Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey did it before her. Give people the credit they deserve+dvd
Excellent Anime!+P+This is one of my favorite anime series of all time.  I've had this collection for about a month and not only have I watched it repeatedly, but I've shown it to all of my friends and now they all want it!  This thinpack boxset is a great value over buying the series individually.     One note: This has all 12 episodes of Fumoffu on 3 discs, while the separate DVDs have 12 episodes on 4 discs.  (When I saw a fourth disc for sale I got worried that I was missing something.)    I watched all of the Fumuffo eopisodes before watching the complete original Full Metal Panic and still thoroughly ejoyed them.  There isn't much carry-over between them, although the characters are the same. I love Sosuke's deadpan comic lines.  My favorite episode is the "Patient of Darkness," where Kaname tries to get a rise out Sosuke in a haunted hospital.   A must have for your anime collection+dvd
Classic Filming At Its Best, Better In 3D+P+I've always been a fan of this film, though it wasn't until recently that I got to see it all the way through to the end.  In 2D, "Creature..." is good, but only that.  Since this film was intended to be seen in true 3D form, and that doesn't mean in the crappy red&blue anaglyph glasses version, that really is the best way to see it.  Gladly, the field sequential 3D edition is available from two web sites and it is fantastic.  The stereo depth really makes the movie better than ever.  Plus, all the dimensional sight gags work instead of just making you wonder why they were filmed that way.  Being able to experience the stereo depth of the beautiful underwater photography, even in black & white, leaves you wanting more in the end.  I highly recommend "Creature From The Black Lagoon", but only in 3D using the shutter glasses system found in the "Ultimate 3D Collection" from Amazon.com (buy it cheap from a used&new seller)+dvd

Like A Fart, In Movie Form+N+How the hell can you make a movie with talking monkeys totally suck?  It should have been a slam dunk+dvd
Great movies!+P+Although I haven't bought this package, I've seen both films.   The first film was really great, it earned 5/5 stars right off the back. The fight scenes were intense, with some great, upbeat music playing. In addition to the intensity, there was a lot of first-person views. There There was a cliffhanger ending, though.  The second film was OK, but not as good as the first one. It continues the first one, but they used totally different actors to play Raiden, Sonya, Jax, and Johnny Cage. I would give it a 4/5 stars because of the short fight scenes and over-use of slow motion. I would have given it a 3/5, but it earned a star for the awesome music. It was pretty good film, for those who appreciate the hard work of others+dvd
Terrible-don't waste your money+N+This supposed 'language lab' is VERY poorly designed. The dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language. The amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken! It might as well be completely random sounds, since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context. While I understand that supposedly this DVD is only intended to 'stimulate' the brain, by six months, a baby's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language, and to selectively ignore others. The brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home, thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid. A baby's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language. Habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again. Imagine if the baby's brain gave equal attention to any sound--the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers. We acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective.   Babies depend heavily on repitition, adult modeling, observing cause and effect, and from watching other people's behaviors to learn language. The idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly. If you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home, try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis, or show him programs like Dora or Sesame Street, where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning, clear annunciation, and repition.+dvd
What's The Worth In It?+N+My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it.  That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing+dvd
Thomas Hardy?  Not even Oliver Hardy!+N+After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.  +dvd
30 minutes of pure crap+N+First things first the moive suck ass, this SUCKS EVEN MORE ASS!Dumb animation ever! Dumb story! Dumb secenes that donot I repeat DONOT make any bit of damn sence! AVIOD AT ALL COST +dvd
Why Didn't Anybody Tell Me They Made A Movie Of This?+P+Why am I only finding out now that there was a film of `Slaughterhouse Five'? The advent of DVD has brought back some great films that have been lost or forgotten.  Everywhere I go I'm told that `Slaughterhouse Five' was the greatest book ever written. But I've never gotten around to reading it. The film leaves no doubt that in print or on film this is one of the greatest stories ever told.   The Plot: This is what I've always asked. "What is this great story `Slaughterhouse Five' about?" Now that I know I can see why all my friends were at a loss to explain it.  The story does not sound intriguing in theory but is great in practice. `Slaughterhouse Five' is about a man Billie Pilgrim who is "lost in time" that is, every 30 seconds he jumps forward or backward to a different time in his life. Somewhat similar to `Memento' except it was 5 minutes and he was always going backwards.  Billie Pilgrim's life has three main settings. He was drafted into WWII and taken prisoner at the Battle of the Bulge. As a POW he is taken to Dresden and survives the single worst massacre of WWII. In the 1950s he experiences suburban life as a father. And in his later years he is abducted by aliens and enslaved with a topless movie star to reproduce.  See what I mean, these are three very odd stories that shouldn't work together. There is the very serious issue of Dresden, the "open city" in Germany with no armed forces or war production which was inhabited by European refugees hoping to wait out the war in peace. But on February 14 1945 the Allies decided to destroy German moral by ordering hundreds of British and American bombers to fire bomb the city. On February 15 they returned, and on the 16th they sent in American fighters to machine gun as many survivors as possible. 135,000 civilians died, more than Hiroshima or Nagasaki. A rather serious issue for a sci-fi film.  Why is Billie lost in time? We never know but suspect it may be because he's abducted by aliens where he says time does not exist. Or it may be that after a plane crash he has brain surgery.   Billie is a likeable character because he doesn't really say or do anything on his own. Billie does not shape events, events shape him. He didn't go to Dresden because he wanted to, he gets married and works only because that is what's expected of him. And the aliens abduct him.  Billie is not so much an actor as he is an observer. And his loss of time is just like everyone else. One moment I'm writing this review and the next I'm back to last night watching this film. Our minds jump to different times in our lives.  As for the production quality of this film, it's great. The WWII scenes are very authentic and high budget. The acting is good although there are no notable actors. Billie is played by Michael Sacks whose filmography is thin and unotable. I only remember him as the hostage cop in `Sugarland Express'. The topless actress is played by Valerie Perrine who you may remember as Lex Luther's girlfriend in the `Superman' films.   `Slaughterhouse Five' may sound as bizarre as its title named after Billie's POW barracks, but it's a very powerful story that will make you laugh, cry, and smile. I can't believe a film buff like me didn't know about. It just shows you how many lost gems are being found on DVD.  +dvd
Awful+N+I have enjoyed the Sharpe novels and have read them twice, along with most everything else Bernard Cornwell has written. Therefore I spent over $300 for the DVDs, relying on the opinions offered to Amazon.  I have played three of them and have been very dissapointed. The productions have bastardised the novels. The acting becomes laborious, the plots rediculous,the low-cost production obvious, and most of all boring. I cannot stand to look at the rest of the serious and have not done so.   I will gladly ship the lot off to anyone who will pay the shipping from South Africa. The pewter letter opener broke with the first letter I attempted to open and was trashed, as the whole set should be+dvd
Terribly Miscast+N+This is a very lifeless production of Julius Caesar. Jason Robards is monotone and Charleton Heston rants and raves without ever parting his teeth.  It is Planet of the Apes in Roman togas. If anyone knows where I can find a copy of the play starring Marlon Brando, please advise. +dvd
disappointment!+N+I liked Vin Diesel despite Riddick and thought that he can be a good action star. Unfortunately, this movie at the very least didn't demonstrate his acting abilities (unless you consider looking tough as an acting skill). Grunted, the movie doesn't help. It is badly written, badly directed. Overall, mediocre B-movie.+dvd
Put this in a box, tie it with a ribbon, and take it home!!!+P+I am a huge fan of Doris Day!!! And this is one of my all time favorite movies!!!! Doris day stars as Georgia Garret in this fantastic masterpiece. This film is for people who LOVE Doris Day!!!!!! Like me!!!+dvd
Worth a rental+N+Let me start off by saying, I have not seen the orignal Wicker Man. This movie kept me guessing all the way through, which earns it one star. I couldn't tell if Willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting. I did enjoy Ellen Burstyn's performance as the "Queen Bee" so to speak. So many unanswered questions or things that didn't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie. I am generally not a fan of neat, tidy, happy endings, so that wasn't a problem for me, but the numerous loose ends were. Worth a rental, but probably not worth purchasing+dvd
Buy the other version -- the Tai Seng release+N+I would like to give this version 5 stars, i love the movie, but this is the Dimension release which only offers an English language dub. If that's OK by you, then this is the cheaper version, but if you are a purist like me, you'll want the Cantonese/Mandarin version with English subtitles+dvd
A Little Nasuating+N+I had avoided this for sometime but finally relented so I could see a young Diane Lane. She is the only redeeming part of this rather silly movie, not even product placment clips of Paul Newman and Robert Redford make it bearable. Hideous accents abound and way to many sexual references i.e. statues in the Louvre, porno flick to make it really innocent. Olivier is really pretty awful, he must have been really hard up for money to support Joan Plowright and the kids.  Broderick Crawford playing himself is even worse.  Where did they come up with this cast?  So rent Henry V or Rebecca for Olivier; All the Kings Men for Crawford; Long Hot Summer for Newman; The Great Gatsby or Butch Cassidy for Redford and just say no to A Little Romance.          +dvd
Hulk HD-DVD+P+You will not find a more spectacular looking HD-DVD. This is the movie to have to show off your HD system to your friends. Simply amazing. Pay no attention to the trolls who give this one star, they are just trying to promote blu-ray and have most likely not even seen this movie on HD-DVD.+dvd
Doggy-Doo+N+This film is as bad as the first Howling film was good. The plot is so hackneyed and predictable that you start to pray it will get it over with soon.  I understand that the author of the original book was angry that Joe Dante changed the plot for Howling 1. This film is said to be closer to his original vision. All I can say is thank god that Dante altered it. See Dante's original, American werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps,Dog Soldiers, Underworld, anything but this. It's an embarassment to cinema+dvd
GREAT BAND , VERY GREAT CONCERT DVD+P+I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE SEE THIS GREAT BAND FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE PEARL JAM CONCERT IN ITALY, IT'S A VERY GREAT BAND THAT MAKE A GREAT DVD CONCERT,  EXCELLENT ATMOPHERE AND SOUND IN THIS DVD!+dvd
Not his best, but still very,  very good!+P+Yeah, ok, the drummer is way off, his timing sucks and he looks alternatively sick, angry or distracted.  Maybe he was sick that day.  But we have to remember that it is a live performance with all the screw-ups that come with it.  Betts is still a master guitarist and band leader.  My only question is why is the sound on the CD so much fuller and better than on the DVD?  They were recorded at the same show!  I have to also highly recommend the 3 cd Instant Live set, recorded with this same band+dvd
Perfect to watch close to Halloween & Christmas.+P+Jack Skelington rocks!!!!!! Wow I wonder what Thanksgiving Town is like, or maybe Easter Town, Or Saint Patricks Town oh well.+dvd
Battle Royale II+N+Unfortunately this sequel to the amazing cult classic doesn't stack up to the original at all. Despite the disappointing movie I was very pleased with the DVD itself. It comes in a well packaged case and there are plenty of extras on the DVD to keep you busy. The product itself was very good, I wish I could say the same for the movie+dvd
Mud+N+Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining+dvd
Not So Complete+P+This DVD is a reworking of a TV series from the mid-90s that was released on VHS as "Jacques Pepin's Cooking Techniques".  Unfortunately, not everything from the original series has been included on the DVD. As stated by other reviewers the presentation format in the DVD is also combersome, with most segments lasting less than five minutes and then returning to the menu.    It would have made a much better product and been less disjointed if they just released on DVD the original series as originally made.  Also the DVD features a couple of segements from Jacques' early 90s series "Today's Gourmet".  It would be great if KQED would release these on DVD also.   Nevertheless, the DVD does present the basic and most common techniques used in the kitchen, and is useful for anyone who wants to improve their skills as a cook. +dvd
a good film from a great man+P+Was it worth the attention? Definitely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? Certainly. Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably.  As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.  As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.  The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.  Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy. +dvd
Japanimation comes to life!!!!+P+NOOOO...this movie isnt based on some anime film. NO NO NO!, but it unfolds like a hilariously awesome classic the likes of which ive only seen from old school anime films of the late 80s/early 90s.  If the matrix was suppost to be a Ghost In The Shell rip off, then this film, The Legend 2, embodies even more of what the matrix was supposivly influenced by.    NOOOO...this is not a cold hearted all serious flick...it doesnt take it self overly seriously...yet it is at the same time quite INSPIRING...  Now this is the genuis of this little film, its not this masterwork of film making...yet it has times of genuine hilarity, while still stirring your spirit in awe. Something like this can be a little toung-n-check, yet still evokes one's admiration.  Without sounding to lofty on the descriptions here, people, The Legend 2 might of not been exactly like the chinese language version...But it is very memorable in its own right...   The voice actors behind the talented cast here are some from the finest films in Japanese Anime...thats right...you might notice some from Ninja Scroll...Project A-Ko...and MORE...These voice actors bring that comprehensive hilarity to the screen....Yes, sorry if i sound like a washed up editoral hack...but bare with me... For instance... When the men tease Fong about him following his mother around...its just random and so damn funny. And the main bad guy, is great...he's a frstrated bully of a character who at times wont relent at insulting Fong about his closeness to his mom.   And speaking of which , Fong and his "legendary" mom are one funny duo. And so is the man who sorta looks after Fong, who was the mothers ex lover i think. He has a funny deep serious voice.  The action looks like it inspires the great anime films...thats right...not inspired by the anime...it seems like it would INSPIRE the anime world itself...It doesnt draw influence from great anime, but i bet films like this inspire japanese artists to create great anime series and stories!   You might not understand all this, but its a different take , a unique review of the film that no one has noticed yet on amazon, for this film anyways.   Sure, this english dub, American version of the film isnt true to the original...But i remember seeing this on tv...and it was even more edited than this im sure...and it was awesome...i taped it...but lost it i think, but now i finally have it, in its entirity.   This film embodies a lot of what makes Kung Fu films so loveable and great. HUMOROUS CHARACTERS, AWESOME ACTION, INSPRING STYLIZATION.  The scene where Fong walks slowly into battle as the colorfull pedals or leaves fall and float down from the sky is just beautifull and has power,cinematographically.....if thats a word, hahaha.   This is a classic...it melds together serious inspiring action and laugh out loud hilarity.   And i havent even seen the first movie yet.  Hope this helped ya out in deciding if you wanna get this movie or not. Its not too expensive...when you buy it, just dont expect some oscar winning film...it aint...its not the greatest film ever produced... IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE.+dvd
ORIGINAL IS BETTER+N+If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO+dvd
Batman: The Animated Series = Bruce Timm  Paul Dini  Shirley Walker+N+Yup, not to marginalize the other people who made the show great, but that's basically what it boils down to.  When I saw none of these people in the opening credits, I was concerned.  The people who did make this movie, however, confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film, if not just plain sucky.  I mean seriously, this wouldn't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show, let a lone a film.    In one of the extras, the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a "fun" film and that they finished the script in no time at all.  Guess what, it shows.  That is except for the fun part, but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent.  The plot is extremely cliched and stupid.  Maybe if any of the 3 girls were interesting at all, it would've been passable.  However, we ended up with an extremely annoying, rebeling daddy's girl who looks like a Hale Berry clone, a Renee Montoya clone, and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend.  Yeah, why should I give a crap about any of these chicks?  In the extras they said they didn't want to do something definitive with Batwoman, but I call it laziness and lack of effort.  If Batwoman's secret identity was one good character it might have worked, but instead we get three worthless ones.    I was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after I heard the idea to bring Batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie.  However, any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent.  I did like the fact that they continued the Barbara/Bruce text, but it was only in one short scene.  I guess having Batgirl and Batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason I can't comprehend.  The music to this movie isn't that great as everyone else said, especially compared to Shirley Walker's beyond amazing score.  However, I disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good.  It looked like low-budget, digitally colored, corny crap to me.  Definitely no where even close to the amazing, noir-influced film making from the tv show.  I was also a fan of Penguin's voice in the show, but here he's played by the Mad Hatter's voice actor instead.  I don't know if Penguin's voice acotr died or that he was just busy, but Penguin just wasn't the same this way.    Oever all, I can't find much to like in this film.  I did find the inclusion of fan-service including Batwoman's costume a nice gesture, but definitely not enough to save this film.  So yeah, only get this if you're a completest.  If you're just starting to buy Batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead.  Every episode is much more enjoyable than this half-baked movie+dvd
Interesting period piece, godawful DVD release+N+Although this DVD says it's "digitally remastered," that only means that it was transferred from film to the digital medium of DVD.  The releasing company missed a golden opportunity to clean it up -- the film is grainy, flickering and shows signs of deterioration that could and should have been corrected before releasing the film on DVD.  The soundtrack, as well, is perfectly awful, with shattered, screeching highs and inaudible lows.  I have recordings made from wax cylinders recorded before 1910 that have been restored to sound much better than this 1934 release.  It's very discouraging that so little care and attention should have been paid to finally making this film available after so many years.  Anna May Wong, and the people who buy this DVD, deserve better+dvd
This is a poor remake+N+It really looks like it was done on a shoe string budget. The football scenes are lame.  Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was not well done...and not beleivable.  GET THE ORIGINAL...it is worth i+dvd
One of the best remakes ever+P+I remember that the original movie made me cry but nothing could prepare for this remake. The movie was emotionally gripping and compelling. I cried hysterically through the last half of the movie feeling the pain and disappointment that the young Piccolo was going through. I was impressed by the way Brian stood strong and full of faith all the way up to the end.  I thought that both actors did an incredible job, but I was most impressed with Sean Maher's performance. He was believable as the care-free loving husband and competitive spirited football player.   This movie really is worth your time, and I can guarantee you that at least one tear will be shed for this tragic and compelling story+dvd
Good way to learn the footwork and turns of Salsa dancing+P+Look, I am NOT a dancer.  And I am a classical, not a salsa musician.  However, I found the disk quite entertaining and helpful.  Gigi and Pedro do not come across as so elegant and skilled that it seems impossible for the average person to copy.  Yes, both know what they are doing and are quite fluent in what they communicate.    The instruction on the disk allows you to watch their whole demonstration from beginning to end or go through each set of steps and turns lesson by lesson.  You also have THREE choices of camera angle.  The default is from in front.  You can also choose looking down from above, or from the back.  This multi-view method allows you to see things in the dance that a simple 2D presentation from the front actually hides.  The names of the steps are given in Spanish, but even if you don't speak the language you will pick up on the names quickly; it is not hard.  I did miss the discussion of how to communicate dance steps through hand motions that I have seen in another salsa series.  One isn't going to call out the names of the steps as Gigi and Pedro do throughout these disks.  It is the subtle way one moves the hands and touches the partner that communicate what is to be done next and that is as much a part of learning the dance as the footwork.  Still, a pretty darn good set of instructional disks+dvd
Heart Wrenching!+P+I read the book, but the movie really brings home what the story meant.  Truly amazing and heart wrenching - you will cry for Ishi, you will cry for all the Native Americans.  Truly a must see! You will not be disappointed.  Greene does another remarkable job+dvd
hahaha+N+Once again in fantasyland we go with fake "gangstas".P diddo or diddity, pifily poof what ever his name is this week.This movie is not worth the price of the plastic used to make it.the established italian mobsters would not put a black or puerto rican on equel footing.these guys would not share the same area in the joint.ridiculous!!!when it comes to TRUE GANGSTERS there are serious racial/ethnic barriers.That is just the facts.As much as the mass media tries to rewrite history it still doesnt change it+dvd
Croaks+N+You'd think the director of the original Japanese series could turn out a decent sequel. But nooooooo....   Instead, "The Grudge 2" is a detailed, shimmering example of why people loathe sequels, and how (with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies) they are pretty much always bad. Overused spooks, lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror.   Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) learns that her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is seriously ill, and goes to Japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results. Karen's last warning: "Don't go in that house."   Other people aren't doing the same, since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone's least favorite croaking ghosts, Kayako and Toshio. And an American family in Chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts, which have somehow transferred out of Japan and into the United States.   Aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of Karen's madness and demise, going to the abandoned house that Karen tried to burn down. As the malevolent ghosts close in on them, Aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned Kayako into an evil force that cannot be stopped...   Ghosts, ghosts, everywhere, and not one of them is actually scary. Apparently Takashi Shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie, the scarier it becomes. Sadly, it doesn't work that way -- Kayako and Toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes, and when they aren't around, OTHER ghosts are popping up for no good reason.   All those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline, with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film. The schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable, and the Chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable (and dreaded) "Grudge 3," during which the horror rules get recklessly broken. So only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about Kayako.   It's rather sad that Gellar is the ruling force here, and she's only in it for a few minutes total. She's certainly more charismatic than the Tamblyn, who seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Ohga Tanaka and Takako Fuji provide some scares as the ghosts, even misused, but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting.   "Grudge" had its flaws, but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots. Cinematically, this is a curse+dvd
Bizzaro Rules!!!!!!!!!!+P+I love Sealab 2021, it's an excelent show. I mean it's probably one of the stupidest shows of all time but it's just so darn funny. And the Bizzaro episode is the best. Turtleface rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
Bad, just plain bad.+N+Spoilers ahead: I am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies, and totally enjoy a good B flick. But I have to say that this one was just terrible. There's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever, I just couldn't believe how stupid the main character really was!! How do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you? I mean come on!!! Breaking into the rangers office on site, no less, and getting drunk...all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her? Then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho. Was no one else shouting at the screen "Grab the cop's gun and shoot the psycho!" as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike.  And running infront of the truck, in the headlights... There was forest all around her and she never once went and hid, just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom. A sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it's misery in my opinion. No, it was simply unbelievable and I was relieved when the credits rolled. So glad I didn't actually pay the rental fee on this one+dvd
Far Better Than I Expected+P+If some one had told me this film would turn into a story of an actual war between nations, I would have watched it sooner. The reviews I had read for it made it sound like a rip-off of Akira, and the first hour or so makes you think it just might be it.  A group of friends who are in a sort of Xtreme motorcycle sport find themselves in the middle of their nation Aphrodia invaded by the nation of their enemy Ishtar. They quickly find themselves under military rule, and have to deal with life changing in such a time period. The group eventually decides to do some guerilla action and attack an enemy tank that is always in their stadium.   Then, just as the tank is destroyed and reinforcements are coming up, and the hero is about to be run over...a Free IO soldier fires a missile into the Octo and destroys it.  Then the movie becomes a story of a nation fighting for their freedom, as the group joins the free soldiers who are fighting Ishtar all the way back out of IO. Eventually the hero, at first sympathetic, is convinced to join forces. The final battle takes place in the capital of IO, and what a climax it is.  Overall, the film boasts fine animation and retro 80's anime design. The action is well done and the mecha designs even better, and the storyline is also exceptionally well done. You get a good sense of a population under foreign rule, and its good to see an anime exploring such depths. Also, the politics of a nation in exile fighting for their return is equally unique. Maybe its because I'm a political nut, but I found it all interesting.  If I had known I would have enjoyed this film, I would have watched it far sooner than I did. Oh well...I bought the DVD the minute I saw it. I'm proud to own it. And thats my word+dvd
Disappointing+N+While this wasn't the worse film that I have ever seen it comes close.  This had the potential to be a really awesome and dramatic story, but it turns out to be slightly more interesting than watching paint dry+dvd
a disapointment+N+Of all the terrific Betty Grable films I don't understand how this one made it to dvd. I just thought the story was dull and the dvd quality wasn't the greatest. I wish they would put I Wake up Screaming, The Dolly Sisters and Mother Wore Tights on dvd+dvd
Boring, like watching snow melt...+N+The Snow Queen is an ancient story from Northern Europe about a beautiful lady with a heart of ice who resides near the North Pole, and uses winter to take the lives of innocent human beings, and uses her beauty and charm to seduce innocent men.  Live action movies and cartoon versions of this story have been made in numerous decades in multiple languages.  One of the later ones is this 3 hour version by Hallmark Entertainment.  Taking place somewhere in Scandinavia; most likely Denmark, the setting is a small rural village in the mid 20th century.  A father loses his wife to winter, and raises his daughter at their hotel.  One day, he hires Kai, a young man, to help with labor around the hotel.  He and the daughter fall in love, but the Snow Queen steals Kai away.  The daughter sets forth on a journey across earth and the four seasons to find the lair of the Snow Queen to rescue Kai.    The movie's story is quite good and offers much promise.  But the movie drags too much; the dialogue is often muted, and the Snow Queen is somewhat wooden; not enough emotion.  The idea of a beautiful queen of ice is done much better in the Chronicles of Narnia than here, as Bridget Fonda does not do much talking at all.  The idea of the robbed girl having to travel across the spring, summer and autumn to find Kai is quite innovative and only possible by the crew of Hallmark, but again it was not done well.  The action scenes were somewhat fake, and most importantly, the snow in the winter scenes clearly looked like fake snow.  Overall, a good attempt but a bad result. +dvd
Self Adulation Never a Good Thing !+N+I was such a huge Tiesto fan until I saw this DVD.  I bought it on the basis of other reviews but I guess I haven't yet joined the cult of P so have missed the point of the DVD.  Tiesto is a master at what he does there is no doubt about that however after this DVD I have lost some respect for him.   I thought from the DVD I would learn a little more about the man eg influences, inspiration etc etc.  instead all I got was a DVD that showed yet again that the DJ has become greater than the music (and I won't debate the merits or otherwise of that) and endless shots of (mostly Americans) going on about how brilliant he is.  This DVD is self adulation / promotion at its worst, all I can say is shame on you Tiesto making suckers out of your fans+dvd
Top three thrillers of all time+P+everything good you've heard about this movie is probaly true. its plot is undeniably good, the way its shot and done are awsome probaly the best ending ever. the scenes arnt as bad as somem people make them out to be but there still bad, the man comminting all of the seven deadly sins is a great actor and makes you think when hes in the car tlaking about why he does them, it puts that in a way he's right (he could do it a little less ruthlessly) but it definatly is worht every penny you spend for it and its one of the best to add to your collection+dvd
What Causes Zombies?+P+A sailboat arrives in New York Harbor.  It seems abandoned but a coast guard member is killed by a man on board.  The man is shot and falls into the harbor.  The boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him.  She and a reporter hire a boat to find her father.  Their destination is an island said to be cursed.  The boat they hire is run by a young couple.  Along the way the couple do some diving (she is topless).  She is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it.  She is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks.  The Continue to the island which is just a short distance away.  Once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living.  Legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation.  Unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known.  But soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead.  In the end, only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization.  They keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy.  This is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings.  That aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly.  There is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore, although somewhat tame by today's standards.  The acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent.  I enjoyed the ending which I gather was supposed to be a shocker but which I predicted from the beginning.  My guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead, or so the producers hoped.  If you like zombie films you will have to check this one out+dvd
A woman's rise above so many adversities+P+This is a heartbreaking epic tale about the difficult road a young woman must travel when she breaks the rules of social acceptance.  It's hard for a modern young woman like myself to fathom that a mere seventy years ago, this was the fate of an unwed mother. Elizabeth's life is turned upside down when she becomes pregnant, and has no idea where the father has gone.  Social restrictions leave Elizabeth with two unappealing choices: Admittance into a Magdalene convent or marriage to a farmer twice her age whom she has never met.  She chooses the latter and is determined to make the best of it, but the harsh, cold, and desolate landscape of her new home is a metaphor for the fate of her marriage.  Her husband Neely, is very possesive and treats her like a piece of property. He is particularly leary of his Cousin/ Neighbor, Mossie,  who he calls a "Land Grabber".  They have been fueding for years over the ownership of family property which also gives way to Neely's fearful possesiveness over Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Dermot Walsh gives a fantastic performance as the fictional Elizabeth, who has been so severely beat down yet stays incredibly strong throughout all the tragic twists and turns of her life.  The most impressive scene is towards the end when Elizabeth kneels at the grave of her stepdaughter and blames herself for her death. That point is the culmination of so many emotions. It shows how Elizabeth has given all she can to rectify herself for all the wrong-doing she feels responsibility toward, but at this point feels she has failed.  The acting is very powerfull in this scene.   I am giving four stars only because I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. It is sad right up until the end, then there is an admition of love and bam -- a wedding and happy ending.  I feel like if you are going to make a movie four hours long there is no reason for an abrupt ending.    This is a fantastic movie for anyone with an interest in women's studies, social influences, period films, or you just want to see a good old fashioned tale of a person rising above so many adversities.  If you like this movie, a good supplement would be "The Magdalene Sisters". It will show you what would have been in store for Elizabeth had she admitted herself into the Magdalene Convent. It is not for the faint of heart though, as it is much more brutal and depressing. It will make you angry, but will give valuable insight into the bleak choices that faced Elizabeth in Falling for a Dancer.+dvd
What a snooze fest.+N+Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001, Legally Blonde. I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on. Forget this film, buy the original instead.+dvd
The Pianist+N+Supposed to be NEW! Had circular scratches on it upon opening. Would not play. DVD player gave message - "Disc damaged or dirty"+dvd
These Women Rock!+P+This film is a classic!! The writing, the acting, the direction are all superb! And of course the fashion show seen is one of the best in any movie - modern designer scould laern a thing or two!!!!! L'amour, l'amour toujous l'amour+dvd
Biased propaganda buy +N+The Armenian Genocide is a biased piece of propaganda, if you want a truly impartial view of the events buy and view "The Armenian Revolt" by Martin Callaghan an independent US producer it is much more professional and impartial in it's production.  What the Armenian Genocide does not tell you is that the Armenians started revolting and murdered over 500,000 thousand Turks to begin with.  Further, the statistics used in the program are bogus.  Even according to Armenian Sources there were not 2 million Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire during that period.  Further, at the end of World War 1 the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist and the British controlled the former Ottoman Capital of Istanbul.  They conducted a witch hunt, they arrested 144 Ottoman Officials of the leadership including the then eqivulant to the prime minister and conveyed them to their island colony of Malta.  After two and a half years of exhuastive inquiries they could not find any evidence whatsoever to charge any of them let alone convict.  All 144 Ottoman Officials were released and allowed to return home.  Further the investigator Lord Curzon (well known for his hatred of Turks) asked the US Government of the day to provide any evidence they may have had in their possession.  An answer came back that the US did not have any evidence with which to use against the Ottoman leadership.  What the Armenian Diaspora could not achieve via armed conflict and legal means is now trying to achieve politically and by using propaganda like this particular documentary.  There is always two sides to every story and the Armenians will not allow the Turks to put theirs forward.  [...+dvd
The documentary presents a biased history...+N+With the burden of ideological narration, this documentary does not provide an in depth look at the history. It does not provide a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are manipulated and edited together with an biased flow, without a good balance of academia and historians involved. We cannot get the "facts" from different points of view. "Goldberg's film presents a slanted historical account, according to some viewers who wrote into PBS stations and a scholar who participated in the panel discussion. If you only take one side and report their deaths, it seems like genocide. But of course it wasn't that, said Justin McCarthy, a professor of history at the University of Louisville. McCarthy, who acknowledges holding a minority view, believes Goldberg's film takes a selective snapshot of history and fails to address the deaths of many Turks at the hands of Armenian militants. "It was an inhuman, bestial time,  he said. There were wide-scale, mutual massacres across eastern and other areas of (the Ottoman Empire) a mutual- extermination kind of war."+dvd
TOP NOTCH PERFORMANCE+P+I saw Denver in concert in Ireland in April '97.I saw him a couple of times before that in the '90's. It was the last time I would see him in concert sadly. He played solo. It was amazing. I went out and bought this the very next week. Denver is in top form both musicially and vocally, as is his band. There are also some interesting monologues peppered throughout the concert where Denver shares his concerns about the environment and wildlife preservation. A great performance all round.  RCA /SONY:If good quality sound and vision footage exists of 1970's ( I'm sure it does!)Denver concerts, please release it for the fans NOW+dvd
"I found him.  He'll be here very shortly." +N+Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.     Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.     "Diabolique" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, "Diabolique" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.  +dvd
A Poor Excuse For A DVD+N+Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!  Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it "digital transfer" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.  I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.  The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing.+dvd
Data is a bad boy. Worf has a pimple.  Grrr.+N+When we last left the Next Generation crew, Picard saved Data in an Errol Flynn kind of way against the Queen Borg.   Star Trek year: 2375.   We sure are missing the original Star Trek Enterprise crew of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc by now.   Worf who is now assisting Deep Space Nine boards the Enterprise for a visit.  Picard (Patrick Stewart) certainly has his hands full tonight with an elegant dinner for Regent Cuzar.  LaForge (Levar Burton) has an urgent message for Picard at the same time and Picard is trying to memorize the foreign language for greeting Regent Cuzar so as not to insult the Regent.   Admiral Doughtery (Anthony Zerbe) would like to tell Picard that Data (Brent Spiner) has been a naughty robot and will not obey Starfleet protocol. He is holding the Brair patch hostage, which is a population of 600 people.   Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) is the Son'a ship captain.  he enjoys partaking in a quick facial surgery procedure.  (Don't we all wish we could).  Ru'afo informs Picard, Data has turned dangerously violent and has done damage to the ship.  Data must be destroyed.  Picard has 12 hours to save data or Picard will terminate the android himself.   Also in the cast: Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Donna Murphy, Gregg Henry, Michael Horton, McKenzie Westmore (NBC serial, Passions) is credited as a Ba'ku villager.    Does the Brair Patch have Cabbage Patch dolls too?  Sorry I coudn't resist.  Easter Egg: Disc 2 Special Features, click Star Trek Universe, click down to main menu, but do not press.

The Prime Directive.....+P+Okay, this wasn't too bad. The plot is about the Prime Directive and what it means.  Well, an alien force and certain Star Fleet members express interest in a planet with regenerative properties. Their interests violates Star Fleet's golden rule, "The Prime Directive". The Federation may not interfere in the development of other civilizations. Picard makes a very hard choice and go against Star Fleet's golden rule. Picard and his crew must protect and defend the planet. Even if it means the end of their careers at Star Fleet. +dvd
The product of a bygone era in movie-making...+P+In "Lassie Come Home," "National Velvet," and "The Courage of Lassie," Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ... Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five Academy Awards...   As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity... Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young Liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men...  Anticipating her later images of young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both saintly and mature... Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.'   Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle...   From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, "National Velvet" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making...   Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance...  The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream...  Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern...  +dvd
I liked it...........+P+Kris and her father get into a car accident and she ends up loosing her father.  Kris and her friends go to Belgium to clean out her fathers study where he had been working on his latest manuscript.  While there the caretakes talks them into taking a tour of the mine.  While in the mine the group learns the story of Andries Martines who was a murderer and also into black magic.  However as it turns out Andries spirit was not laid to rest.  I don't want to give away too much of it but I really enjoyed it.  Very well done all around and creepy which is a big plus considering some the stinkers I have seen lately+dvd
Technical problems render this oater virtually unwatchable+N+This undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems.  It isn't a bad little western, and the two lead roles are played competently by Vera Miles, whose most famous role was Laurie Jorgensen in "The Searchers," and Sam Elliott, who was born to make westerns.  It had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations.    Unfortunately, the film was not well shot.  None--and I mean not one--of the interior scenes is adequately lighted; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background.  The scenes in the Cactus Jail, which are key and set up the movie, might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light.  Then there's the DVD which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film.  The DVD is blurry and shows every scratch, spot, and speck of dirt that 33 years of obscurity could inflict on the print.  Too bad.  Miles and Elliott deserved better.  Frankly, because of the technical issues, the film is probably not worth wasting 90 minutes on.+dvd
Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ing!+N+When I saw that M. Night Shyamalan was directing this film my interest was peaked, despite the silly premise about an apartment superintendant rescuing some otherworldly nymph from the complex's pool and trying to return her E.T. - reminiscent character home.   I enjoyed Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" (despite both films' easily predictable endings) but was very disappointed with this downright soggy outing (sorry, have to throw some water puns in here).  I laughed outright during the first 15 minutes, promptly dubbed it "The Watery Tart" [/monty python]; then fell asleep out of sheer boredom soon after, thereby missing the bulk of the film.   I'd highly recommend it to anyone having trouble sleeping.+dvd
Awesome movie about an awesome man:+P+I loved it because it really did show Sagan the way he really was.  He did a lot of really wonderful things and I will always miss him+dvd
I could not have enjoyed this more!+P+This is simply the PERFECT movie/series for anyone who is interested in polar exploration.  It's beautifully filmed, interesting throughout, and really makes you feel you are there.  True, Scott is, on the whole, shown in a less than favorable light, but given many of the decisions he made, it would be hard for that not to be the case.  To the film's credit it goes to great lengths to give the context/history behind the mindset that led to those poor decisions.  Likewise with Amundsen, you see his greatness mixed with his flaws.  I wouldn't change a thing about the movie itself.  As to the quality of the film transfer and the sound, it seemed perfectly fine to me - though I'm hardly an expert on such things.  As for the packaging, I admit I was a little disappointed there was absolutely no booklet of any kind, nor are there any "extras" on the discs themselves.  You strictly get the 7 episodes on 3 discs in a double-wide hard case.  But given that exploration is rarely the subject of any movie, let alone one of this length, I consider this set a real find, worth every penny, and I will treasure it.  One side note: The DVD case says "Featuring Hugh Grant & Max VonSydow", but a very young Hugh Grant has just a tiny little part in this 1985 film, so don't buy this hoping to see him or you'll be disappointed!+dvd
2 out of 10+N+Volunteers is a film I wished that I never saw. It is so bad that I was miserable after finishing it. Was it supposed to be a comedy or an adventure? Throw in bad jokes. Add psychotic John Candy. Steal the idea of The Bridge On the River Kwai. What do you have? I don't know. The greatest disappointment in this film was John Candy. That wasn't the definitive John Candy that I know. Before viewing Volunteers, I was expecting tons of crack jokes. After viewing Volunteers, what a let down! The anticipation of boredom was the last thing on my mind. I am gravely disappointed in this film. Worst part also is the supposed romance between Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. Really, what romance? I don't see the chemistry+dvd
Take me back+P+This is the complete and compelling story of the 1980 U.S. hockey team. The impact their victory had on American citzens at the time can not be measured. The movie makes good use of footage and interviews with the main participants+dvd
VERY anti-Christian+N+The movie has many none-too-subtle *VERY* anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing "Christian" TV Evangelists and Christians themselves as stupid zombies; life as basically pointless.  I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm -- DON'T BUY IT!!+dvd
One of the iconic classics of the genre+P+If you are a fan of early SciFi movies, this is a must-have for your library. There are some classic shot sequences that have been honored in more recent films, and you should look for these. For example, Spielberg must be a big fan. Pay attention to the shot compositions for the field (fence, lighting, etc.) and seek out homages to be found in Close Encounters and War of the Worlds.  It is also highly informative to note the perspectives used for social mores, and for science in general. In today's world, the notion that "the town scientist" would turn his astonomical telescope into the daylight sky and view heavenly objects, then turn it below the horizontal and look across the countryside to view the goings on at a top secret military base, are both hoots. That the scientist sees a classic rocketship and knows simply by the form that it is "atomic", is classic. One can only imagine the wonder that science and the future held for the popular mind back then that the writers could get away with that kind of stuff.  And yet, in contrast, note the strong presentation of the female role, not as a nurse, but as a doctor who makes the initial tough decisions and takes charge of the situation, driving the story forward. Very progressive, when contrasted with the "scientist love interest who exists to admire the brilliance, bravery and manhood of the hero" found in the typical films of this genre and era. Admittedly, our heroine is subjected to those stereotypes later on in the story, which is disappointing.  I also love the military response. This is shortly after WWII. Because some kid has a bug up his tail, we roll the tanks onto the trains and storm the town. Commanding officers up on rooftops with binoculars!!  In summary, our modern levels of sophistication might diminish this film to Mystery Science Theater, but that would be unfair. Instead, I recommend watching it once for the sheer joy of it. Then, watch it a second time with a more critical eye and have all your laughs and pick out all your iconic scenes for future reference+dvd
You must be joking.+N+That was what I said quite loudly the night I went to the movies to see this. The story portrayed on film does not even come close to the story in the book. The author,I am certain would have not approved with what has been done with her work. Unfortunately she was already deceased and had no control over it. I know some of you are saying how could that be, her books are still being published. They use her name for the books, but she has not written a book since the sequel to " Heaven", which she didn't even complete herslelf. Other than the performance of Louise Flethcer this movie is a waste of film.  +dvd
Welcome Back To Horrible Hall!+P+The episodes always began in the same fashion: On a stormy night, a disembodied voice welcomes us to an obviously haunted yet strangely colorful castle called Horrible Hall.  A vampire bat flies across a full moon and attempts to enter a window, which inexplicably moves, causing the bat to crash into the stone wall, revert to vampire form, and fall to the ground.  The vampire looks at the viewer and gripes, "This place is driving me BATTY!"  The vampire, of course, was Count Drac, one of the hosts of Filmation's GROOVIE GOOLIES, a 1970's favorite which is the latest new release under BCI's Ink & Paint brand.  This cartoon, a spin-off of the then-popular THE ARCHIE SHOW and originally paired with the adventures of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH, is a long-awaited release that has finally come to DVD in a package featuring the complete series on 3 discs.  An exponent of the classic Universal Monsters craze that began in the 1960's (and was still going strong in the '70's), GROOVIE GOOLIES was a gang of friendly, rock-and-roll-playing monsters whose adventures acted as a sort of monsterized kids' version of ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN, following almost the same format right down to the wall of windows (here christened "Weird Window Time") where the characters told jokes and one-liners.  In addition to Drac, the other Goolies were Frankie (the friendly, sweetly goofy Frankenstein's Monster), Wolfie (a hip, surfing, hot-rod-driving, practical-joking Werewolf), Mummy, Boneapart (a skeleton who fell apart as often as not), the sexy Vampira-inspired Bella LaGhostley, wacky witch-cook Hagatha, and a host of others.  Sabrina makes appearances as well, along with some of the other characters from her show (which deserves its own release as a companion to this set, as the Goolies originated on SABRINA).  The pacing of each episode is frenetic, which helps with some of the humor; many of the jokes are enormously corny, but the delivery and speed with which they are told makes them funny, and the character voices are top-notch talent, featuring Howard Morris and Larry Storch doing most of the characters.  Each episode also featured fun, cute and funky soft-rock songs that were usually somehow related to the show (two per episode), and the Goolies actually scored a Top Ten hit during the '70's with "Chick-A-Boom," which is also here.  The episodes have been well restored, with vibrant color, and the artwork, which Filmation has usually excelled at, really stands out.  Extras include commentary for two episodes, featuring Lou Schemier (head of Filmation during its run),historian Darrel McNeil, monster expert Bob Burns and GOOLIES head writer Jack Mendelsohn, hosted by voice-over artist Wally Wingert.  Wingert also appears as one of the stars of a "docu-comedy" called GOOLIANS, which combines documentary material with a sitcom format.  In this feature (which runs almost like a GOOLIES episode) Wingert and fellow Goolian Daniel Roebuck (of LOST), both self-confessed monster freaks, are sent on a mission to gather information about the Groovie Goolies to cure their classic monster fixation.  From my point of view, there isn't anything wrong with a classic monster fixation, but along the way we hear from Mendelsohn, Schemier, Alice Cooper (who originated the monsters/rock music connection), Ron Chaney (grandson of Lon Jr.), Forrest J. Ackerman (ex-FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND publisher) and more, so maybe it's a good thing.  If you're looking for a way to introduce your kids to the idea that sometimes scary can be fun, grab this set; it's a great Halloween treat and a wonderful return visit from some old fiends.  To quote Frankie, "We NEEDED that!+dvd
Branagh's Frankenstein+N+Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book.  His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable.  He ruined it.  Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable.  The end of Justine is pointless.  Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster.  Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme.  Frankly, disgusted.  Kenneth, what are you doing+dvd
Weak.+N+In my opinion, none of the episodes captured the best of the Pink Panther series.  +dvd
Cool!+P+I'm a ripe old 47 years of age and I thought this show was so awesome when I was a young'un.  I will get the DVDs eventually but wanted to let you fans know that a diecast of the XL5 spaceship will be available soon at fabgearusa.com+dvd
Walk away the pounds+P+This is an excellent way to get yourself moving! We all have to start somewhere, and this is a good way to do it+dvd
kids love numbers+P+My students love NUMB3RS.  They tell me they would have never watched this at home if they had not been introduced to it in my class.  They are very interested in "non-school" applications of math and since they catch the "bad guy" every week, I consider this character education.  You see, I teach in a secure juvenile detention facility+dvd
Jungle Book 2 Did not Have To Be made Limited Issue Is 100 Times Better+N+Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time. Its made for  the child also the adult like me. I bought  Jungle Book 2 totally dissapointed in the dvd.  I did not like it at all I returned it.Its a horible movie for children:  Disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.I give this dvd A -+dvd
Excellent film, Horrible DVD!+N+Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film+dvd
Very disappointed+N+My 9-year-old daughter absolutely loved the book.  I thought I would get the movie for her so that she can get a visual sense of what rural life is like in America.  Specifically, I wanted her to see how Marty's family is rural and poor yet proud and dignified.  Unfortunately, none of that came through very well in the movie.  In fact, the "ruralness" and poverty aspects did not come through at all!  Also, what's the deal with this absolutely unnecessary character named Sam??  Finally, this movie also failed to present the various ethical dilemmas that Marty had to face in his attempt to rescue Shiloh+dvd
Not for beginners+P+This is a cool video, just from the standpoint of watching Jaco Pastorius play, however it's wrong to say that it is a bass instruction video. It's just two bassists swapping ideas. There is no time spent demonstrating any kinds of technique or style, and the accompanying booklet is pretty useless, as it doesn't suggest fingerings, or strings, which is OK for a tune, but pointless for an excercise. The only way you'll learn from this is to go through it frame by frame and hope you'll be able to figure out how he's playing.  Also not so good from terms of performance, Jaco's not at his best here, and has put a fretted neck on his fretless for demonstartion, but it slows him down in the live jam.  All in all, very cool to watch, but don't expect to learn much, or hear much, kind of like watching a VH-1 interview or something of that ilk. Snippets of tunes will get you fired up, but nothing is really explained+dvd
Blockbuster!!+P+This film is the best review on record of what happened in 1967. The reviews that denigrate it don't answer the charges, they just distract. The FACTS and the EVIDENCE show that Israel attacked a U.S. ship in international waters and tried to sink it, for whatever motive. Some feel that it might have been because Israel, our "gallant little ally", was executing POW's because they didn't have the logistics to care for them. Others feel it that they were going to sink the ship and blame it on Egypt, thereby drawing us into the conflict directly on Israel's side of course. (where have we seen this before?) The detractors can't deal with the facts and this film PROVES Israel is a murdering, traitorous, backstabbing nation whose only alligiance is to themselves.+dvd
Over the shoulder boulder holders+P+I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.  It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.  In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.  It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.  Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.  The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. "Over the shoulder boulder holders" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.  I've heard "Wind Beneath My Wings" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear "Wind Beneath My Wings" the same again.  Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.  I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo+dvd
Frosty--5 stars, Frosty Returns-0 stars+N+Frosty is a perfect classic as always.  Great story and characters.  But, boy Frosty Returns makes this one you should probably skip.  First, the story and songs are weak. Second, Christmas isn't even mentioned. The directors have fallen for the left wing anti-Christmas agenda, resulting in the kids school having a "Winter Carnival" instead. Pathetic. The real Frosty would melt with anger.+dvd
Boring+N+For the converted  and knowledgeable about St. Therese - you will be reaffirmed. For those looking for a good movie, you will be bored to tears..+dvd
Classic+P+What a combo. When this movie was made, Depp was emerging as a truly great actor, alongside the great Al Pacino. Fantastic+dvd
Aaron Kwok gives a great performance in this silly cop movie.+N+Kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever. He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.   I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5   DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie.+dvd
BUCK NAKED BABES (SOMETIMES WITH SOCKS) AND MOSTLY FAKE BREASTS+N+When it's sweltering here in our Palm Springs desert paradise, clothing optional settings and activities are a natural for many locals and visitors.  So if it's summer and you live here, odds are that you're already naked as you read this.  In the soothing NUDE YOGA & TAI CHI ($20), five buck-naked youngish women go through relatively easy yoga and tai chi routines. To someone who is an amateur of both disciplines, the yoga seemed superior to the tai chi.    When this title was first released on home video, it was  criticized by some hard core feminists as merely another excuse to exploit naked women with large, augmented, breasts and that it's nothing more than soft core titillation.    Maybe and maybe not.      Since sexual energy is an element of yoga (remember Madonna's suggestive yoga poses in W magazine?), if this digital routine arouses, perhaps that's just an added bonus.  The low key elevator music and the almost hypnotic, non-intrusive narration make this a nice morning or evening routine to either get the blood flowing or to wind down.  Not Rated: Full frontal nudity (sometimes with socks).  Genre: Exercise.  95 Minutes.  +dvd
Very Nude but not very Yoga+N+I can't judge the Tai Chi but the Yoga in this video was not well done.  The producers hired attractive women with gorgeous bodies and large breasts--but no Yoga skills.  So this video does not combine the beauty of Yoga with the beauty of the human body.  It would be absolutely wonderful to have a talented and flexible Yoga instructor do Yoga postures correctly...and in a manner that is intentionally sexually explicit and erotic.  I don't see any problem with that.  Probably few if any dedicated Yoga instructors would consider doing that sort of video.  I'm sure it would be frowned upon by the serious Yoga community which might consider it degrading.  So we end up with a second rate product like this video.  Too bad.  Nevertheless, I do enjoy watching these women show us their bodies+dvd
A Great Gospel Film+P+I heard about this version of the life of Christ, but had never seen it.  It is a striking black and white telling of the Gospel of Matthew.  It is beautifully filmed (there are a few problems with subtitles, but you can follow the story just fine) movie, and very true to Matthew's gospel.  As a pastor and a Christian, I highly recommend this moving video+dvd
fulci lives!+P+Let me start by saying that i love this movie and  love fulci.This was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated,it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it.(Let me explain.)this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me.When i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from 'city' i was shocked.When i watched the nipple scene in 'ripper' i was shocked.Watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest(im sorry).The only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned,which honestly i enjoyed more.Zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest.(Isnt that why we watch fulci flicks?+dvd

Of all versions out their this is the one you should buy. Get City of the living Dead and The Beyond will your their, you wont be disapointed !! Lucie Fulci, we miss you +dvd
Comments about this DVD+N+Although I truly enjoy Louie Prima's music, this DVD does not due him justice.  The sound and picture quality is poor. The performances are old and all in BLACK & WHITE!! The only parts in color are the commentary and the cemetary photo where he is buried.  Better to just buy a CD and listen to him perform. This DVD is way overpriced for its poor quality. I do not recommend unless you just want anything and everything there is available on Louie Prima, no matter what the quality is like. I was very disappointed+dvd
absolutely the best rock dvd+P+The dvd of your life! David is great, all are great here, the sound the the images are very good+dvd
excellente série !+P+J'adore et je suis contente d'avoir pu commander cette superbe série en vost ! Amazon est rapide et fiable +dvd
Many new turns during an overall great season 3!+P+The Shield is one of those shows I think that will attain even more pop culture status as time goes on, even long after it leaves the airwaves. The show is centered on cops who do corrupt things in order to ultimately put a major smash into the drug and arms trades in Los Angeles. I've spent my reviews of season one and two going in depth on how the camera's angles are unique and how each character has a ton to contribute to the show. This time I'm simply going to tell you little bits and pieces of what is going on with season three, and it will probably not make any difference because if you have already seen one and two, you know you have to go back for more!  Season three tends to get deep in two areas. The one area is the character development. Mackey's ongoing separation from his wife, coupled with finding out his second child is also autistic is a big downer, but besides that he's also laying pipe everywhere east of L.A. so it apparently isn't bothering him as much as he'd like to let on. Things between him and Shane Vendrell start to go south quickly. Shane and Vic were always good friends but as the pressure for the team to produce results as well as keep secrets and stay within boundaries mounts, Vic starts pulling back, starts easing off. This action does a boomerang effect for Shane Vendrell, who launches forward with more reckless abandon on cases than never before!  Despite all the drama in their personal lives (Yes, Julian the African American cop, is still gay, still a devout Christian to the point of fanatically, and still married to a women he's trying to have a child with) the street lives are alive more than ever. Rival Gangs, horrible hit squads, CI's (Confidential Informer) and sting operations happen in a one two three punch combination throughout the series.  Kicking off-season three, we have two gangs who are bad, mad and territorial. They are the Byz Latz and the One-Niners. Oh and did I mention they both acquire massive amounts of MP-5 submachine guns to try and further their struggles?  The Armenian mob of course, is still in the ongoing storyline from season 2, and its not getting pretty. People are still showing up with they're feet cut off, and it looks like they are not going to stop. Where did their money go, and who shot two of their men when it was taken? Oh well, excuse us, we're the Armenian mob, and our money train is gone, so its time to hack off more feet! Speaking of the money train, Vic decided to use some of it in an undercover operation, only to accidentally circulate it back into the drug trade. What Vic doesn't know is that there was someone else watching the Armenians, and slipped in ten thousand dollars worth of MARKED BILLS.  The Strike team is in hot water as well as the "Decoy Squad" is now implemented to ultimately take over their job after a trial run. This is how great this series is, you take a bunch of newbies and chuck them into an ongoing plot and all they do is ADD their talent in acting and screen presence to the table. Some interesting heat will come down on the decoy squad, as well as something terrible happening to Juliens former partner Tommy.  The corruption and mystery within the crime community runs deep, but doesn't ever lose us much. On the surface we still are able to keep up with the Strike team walking the line between good cop/bad cop, and gangs galore continue to wreak havoc in the streets. The drama and problems with EACH character continues to mount to the point you think it will crash before winning. Wrong again, these stories are tightly written and really do a good job to keep us intrigued because lets face it, like life, in the Shield you never know what is going to happen next.  The last few episodes are pretty intense. The strike team gets dissolved and Shane gets partnered up with a new guy named "Army" (he's an Iraq war veteran). Shane and Vic have a showdown of sorts, which really comes from all of the money issues and changed tactics involved in the money train. Season four will surprise you as well as please you, as it will see the roles of these 2 friends change quickly enough.  Season three starts off a little slow but considering the buildup to the ongoing storylines that are really turning into quite the dramatic and suspenseful mini-epics we hoped they would be, it's well worth the weight. Claudette and Dutch are still there cracking cases every day. Aceveda also appears to be going over the edge and it will be interesting to see if he can ever come back in the future+dvd
Great Samurai movie with roots in American detective fiction+P+Yojimbo (The Bodyguard) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of Dashiell Hammett - particularly Red Harvest. Akira Kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into Japanese cinema. Its interesting that the two main influences in this process were Hammett's hard-boiled detective fiction and William Shakespeare (Ran, Throne of Blood). The always-excellent Toshiro Mifune plays the nameless title character who schemes and plots of take down an entire town of gamblers and gansters. I won't recap the story, suffice to say that his plans lead into several battles and some beautifully choreographed sword fights. Yojimbo was later made (nearly scene-for-scene) into A Fistfull of Dollars by Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood as "The Man with No Name." Bruce Willis brought the character back to it's ganster/detective roots with the not-so-good "Last Man Standing." Yojimbo is awash with cinematic violence, but the charm infused into the movie by the cynical, yet obstinately principled, hero surprised me when I first saw it. The performances of the supporting cast, as usual with Kurosawa's films, add depth and wit to each scene. For what its worth, Yojimbo has gradually become one of my favorite movies.   If you end up enjoying Yojimbo, check out The Seven Samurai, Sword of Doom, Miller's Crossing, The Maltese Falcon, and The Thin Man.    Criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and they gave the same treatment to both Yojimbo & Sanjuro. A new (and improved) translation, commentary from Steven Price, as well as documentary film focusing on Kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies.  This review is modified from my review of the Yojimbo/Sanjuro double DVD pack, each movie is great, but I'd recommend picking up both+dvd
WHAT!+N+$58 for a B-movie slasher flick!?  You people are on some serious drugs+dvd
Not Enough Tor Johnson+N+John Carradine gives a great performance but the story is hard to swallow and there's not enough of Tor Johnson.  Worth a look.  Great opening credits+dvd
Luscious+N+Well here we go again.  I tried to watch this movie with an open mind and I just could not stand it. Here we have another movie with Ms. Whurer and it is just like most of her movies very very poorly acted and just a waste of time and film for that matter. If all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you.  If you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than I sugest that you don't waste your time and money.  I guess when they cast for an actress here all they were looking for was how well she looks with no clothing on and did not pay attention to the simple fact that this woman has no talent+dvd

A Bug's Life (Collector's Edition)+P+A Bug's Life (Collector's Edition)~ Dave Foley is one of the best animated movies that I have ever seen period. The animation is top of the line and this movie is so much better then Antz. The story begins with ants collecting food for an offering, and then our "hero" manages to trash this cermoney and then trouble begins. The story is well developed and well written and unlike "Antz" we are here spared pseudo political messages and this is good since the movie is after all made for children and not adults. One important message that is sent is to children is to tollerate different people and not to judge people. The music is splendid and the dialogue is right on the money. Highly recommended indeed+dvd
Must see it to understand what it is to live in Caracas+P+An X-ray of the Venezuelan way of living. Only after seeing this movie, which might seem like fiction but it is not, one can understand what it is to live in a Latin American city like Caracas: a city packed with drugs, violence and corruption - where regular citizens are on their own with no protection whatsoever.  The sad part is that for us, venezuelans, watching this film feels "TOO CLOSE TO HOME". I know at least 8 people who have gone thru similar experiences+dvd
Full-Screen means LESS MOVIE+N+This really is a good film... so WHY in the world did they lop off the sides of it?  It is time for a W I D E S C R E E N version of this film!  In widescreen, my star rating for this film is 3.+dvd
Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park DVD+P+The DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. We continue to enjoy the excellent service that Amazon provides+dvd
Every Republican should see this Film+P+This is an interesting allegorical tale. David Hemmings, in one of his best roles, represents the instinctual nature of the ordinary man with no greater aspirations other than to enjoy the pleasures of life. As political and military figures "wave the flag" to the beat of their own political persuasions, loyalty unto death to those political persuasions is the only proof of loyalty to one's country. Men die in this film and it is not all for queen and country.  +dvd
Awful!+N+Sometimes brainless action movies can be at least entertaining, but this movie does not deliver.  I couldn't even finish watching it on cable.  Really idiotic!  And this from the same director who made "Man on Fire!?!+dvd
Don't buy into the "product description."+N+First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying "Jaws" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by "Jaws 4- The Revenge," in being worse. "III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more "made for TV," as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, "Yeah, right!", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning "Officer and a Gentleman" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of "Jaws.+dvd
The Death Of Jaws+N+Who wrote this movie? That is the first thing I had to ask myself after watching this movie a couple of months ago. Oddly enough, this movie was one of my favorite "scary" films to watch as a little boy...but, as an adult, WOW...this is just BAD. The original Jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second, although not as deep or well paced, is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline. This movie, on the other hand, is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover...at sea world! Who would ever think to incorporate SEA WORLD into the Jaws franchise??? Seriously, It was just a horrible idea! The whole, "Mother Shark lost her baby shark" scenario is just weird...I don't even think that Shark's raise there "pups" once they are born...they just swim away. Not that this is that much different than the plot in Jaws 2, where a "relative" shark of the first Jaws decides to go after Cheif Brody and his kids...cheesy, but still, more fun and overall a better storyline. This movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-D graphics add a overly grainy, aged look to the film. The acting is horrendous. Dennis Quaid is OK, but everyone else is just plain awful. Also, who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass? Who OK'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark's nose hitting it 3 times??? That's not too safe in my opinion. This is just a bad, bad movie. There isn't much that I can say is GOOD about it...but, I will give it 2 stars because it entertained me when i was a little boy and for that i am thankful+dvd
Never Was Widescreen+P+I don't want to call anyone silly, or a THIEF for pirating movies,(just look at the reviews, you'll find him) but just so everyone (and certainly someone in particular) who complains about this Columbia dvd not being widescreen understands, this move WAS NEVER MADE IN WIDESCREEN!  The first widescreen movie in America was "The Robe", released in 1953.  Do a little research before you start bashing film noir (minor) classics like this Bogart picture.  There were NO WIDESCREEN MOVIES BEFORE 1953!  Now as for this dvd.    I Thought the transfer showed very little wear.  All-in-all Columbia did a very nice job here of cleaning up the print.  My only complaint with Columbia is how pricey they seem to think their dvd movies are.  Still, this is a good pot-boiler drama, and Bogart is the best.  I can leave or take Lizabeth Scott in this role as the femm fatalle, another leading lady might've been better; she's not a bad actress, I just prefer a lot of other leading ladies of that time period; she does have a certain bad girl sex-appeal that helps her performance.    If you're not familiar with the story, Bogart plays Rip Murdock, an ex-G.I. returning from the war who suddenly finds himself trying to clear his war-buddy of a murder rap, and then solve his friends murder.  Bogarts character tangles with the dark underworld, mixing it up with killers and a lovely blonde.  This movie has a nice, dark feel to it.  Not as dark as say, "In A Lonely Place" (also Columbia), but still very nice.  I liked this film enough to put out the money, and if you are an honest person who loves old Bogey pictures, then you'll put out the money as well.  Do all of us honest people a favor, don't help drive up the cost of dvds by supporting pirating like some other goofball suggests.  You will never get as good a digital copy by burning your own, unless you're willing to do two things: Buy the most expensive digital recorder you can find, and drop any integrity you have into the ditch to steal a copy+dvd
NOW WE ARE TALKING!+P+So we are at last getting the classic show "Ed, Edd,'n' Eddy" on full season sets. It is about time. I suggest you shoud start with this and then get the other seasons when they come out. Everyone shoud try this show, for it is the true definition of cartoon comedy+dvd
Great comedy from an impractical lifestyle+P+I first saw "Good Neighbors" (1975-77) in the late 1970s on PBS, shortly after the show was completed.  I was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors, and the subtle comedy which didn't hit you over the head to make a point.  When they came on the market in VHS format, I decided to buy them in installments, and am very happy I did.    You likely know the story: Richard Briers plays Tom Good, a frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works for a plastics company.  Good and his wife Barabara (Felicity Kendall) decide to "get back to basics" and thereby Tom quits his job, turns the yard into a huge garden, buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient, bartering for only what they need, etc.  Not a practical life style for 1970s suburban London.  Contrasting are their neighbors: Jerry and Margo Ledbetter, played by Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith. Mr. Ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company Tom Good used to work for;  he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job, which supports his expensive and well furnished home.  Ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity;  Good doesn't answer to a boss or schedule, but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock.  The chemistry and comic timing between all 4 principal actors is very fine, and the laughs are many and frequent.  Despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment.  I haven't seen the DVD version for comparison, but the VHS tapes are very good quality: clear picture, great camera work. +dvd
Tora Tora Tora+P+A very good movie if you can get by the sub titles.+dvd
A great lesson+P+The archetypal tale of finding contentment in ones own backyard is portrayed in this delightful film about a wandering local government official in Bhutan. While "on the road" the official and his co-travelers,(monk, fair maiden, fruit seller) reflect on the lessons of the monks stories about suffering and clinging to false concepts of stability. The pace of this film is most likely slow for American audiences but the pace is integral to highlighting the conflicts within the government officials desire to find nirvana in materialism+dvd
The pits+N+I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan but I simply can't say anything good about this film.  The plot is horrible, the acting unconvincing (even Berenger), the dialouge laughable and the ending, well, sour to say the least.  The pits+dvd
Back to its origins... and the story twists and turns...+P+Watching this movie was like watching part 1, onlything things just got a LOT stranger, and we're finally getting up close and personal with the Tall Man.  I promise that you WILL be left hanging. If you are watching these films strictly because of 2 and 3, then you may be a little dis-appointed, as this one does deliver some really good action, but not at the end, the end is more suited for those who like to read into there movies, who like the stuff with lairs, such as myself, in which case, you are going to go DEEP into the rabbit hole with this one!   To cater to action fans, it is said that Don and Bruce (Campbell) were talking about having Bruce in Phantasm 5 and tie the Evil Dead franchise into it somehow, which could work considering that both of them deal with trancendence of time and space, and both seem to root themselves in the Lovecraftian mythos, not to mention the fact that Phantasm 2 and 3 were total Evil Dead, as well as Bubba Ho-Tep which Don aslo directed!  I really can not but love Don's non-sold out way of doing things. He raises the money for his love, and pours himself into it, has a lot of fun, and always delivers something well worth watching a million times over, so long as you have the patience or interest I guess, which ever. He's a strange one! One of the best!:)  P.S. This movie contains a lot of flashback scenes made from un-used footage form 79. A blast from the past, very cool+dvd
A Middling Collection Of Will's "SNL Career+N+After pretty much laughing my (...) off while watching "The Best Of Will Ferrell", I expected to do the same with "The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2". However, when I watched it on tv in July, I was extremely disappointed. Outside of a few sketches, I hardly uttered a chuckle. However, when I saw this dvd a few weeks ago, I knew I had to buy it, thinking I might change my opinion. Needless to say, it remained the same.  "The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2" is supposed to include sketches featuring some of Will's lesser known recurring characters that failed to make it on the (10 million times funnier) first volume, including rude and incompetent obstertrician Dr. Beamen, Hank of Bill Braskie's Buddies", and Ted Brogan", the 37 - year - old baby. Also there are some sketches that feature non - recurring bits. None of these sketches are funny.  However, there are a few funny sketches. They are the opening Bush sequence, the famed "Wake Up And Smile", "Lovers" (though there's another version of this sketch with the same characters on volume one except it's with Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore and it's much funnier), "Red Ships Of Spain" (with Will doing his Robert Goulet impression), and "Inside The Actors Studio" with Kate Hudson as Drew Barrymore (though the one with Alec Baldwin as Charles Nelson Reilly on the first edition was much funnier).  The only other watchable sketch is "Janet Reno's Dance Party", which really only catches fire when she beats up Mayor Rudolph Giulianni. It's pretty good, but Will impersonated Reno 13 times, so there are probably better Janet Reno sketches out there.  Also, there are many much more funnier characters that didn't appear or only appeared briefly on the first volume that without a doubt should have been included here. I'm talking about Frank Henderson (from the "Get Off The Shed" bit), David Leary (from "Dog Show"), Tom Wilkinson (from "Morning Latte"), Sean Patrick Flannery (from the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches), Baron Nocturna (from "Goth Talk"), Don West (from the "Shopping At Home" sketches), and his Ted Kaczynski and Neil Diamond (where's "Storytellers") impressions.  And why not include more Culps, Spartans, Roxbury, "Jeopardy!", Harry Caray and Saddam Hussein sketches? Yeah, they were on volume one, but they were truly Will's best! And as a final gripe, they could have given us at least one of the Bush/Gore presidential debates sketches.  Overall, you can say this is a complete abomination, but it is tempting. Buy at your own risk and hope that volume three comes out soon and it's much, much better than this dvd+dvd
Believe The Bad Reviews+N+As other people said before me, I couldn't be a bigger Will Ferrell fan.  He's incredible.  But I can't say the same for the writers of some SNL sketches or the people who choose what is put on these DVDs.  I thought his first Best of DVD was pretty good (not great, but what can you do).  As far as the second DVD, it's almost like NBC or whoever felt like playing a practical joke on the buying audience.  None of Will's popular recurring characters showed up, and in the rare instance that they were included (Janet Reno, the lover, Actor's Studio), it was like the worst sketch was chosen.  Again, Will is great, but this DVD is not.  PLEASE believe the customer reviews.  Save your $13 and buy Old School or Elf+dvd
Rio Grande:  The start of a great pairing+P+Rio Grande was conceived as a movie to pay for the making of another film.  John Ford wanted to make a little film called "The Quiet Man" but Columbia Studios wanted a quick money maker to pay for the next production.  The result was "Rio Grande."  A classic in its own right,  one that should not be missed.  Directed by John Ford and starring Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne together for the first time.  The story is what hyou should expect from Ford, good action and get characters.  Look for many familar faces in this film, like Victor MacLagen, Chill Wills, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.  This film is part of the fabled cavalry trilogy.  It is rousing and exciting.  Atrue classic, don't miss it+dvd
A Doris Day Attitude+P+Who doesn't like Doris Day?  She's perky and cute and you can't keep from smiling when you watch her movies.  We enjoy this collection, although some of the shows are better than others.  A great keepsake for fans+dvd
Very silly+N+Legend of the Eight Samurai is just as bad as you'd think it should be. The plot bounces around in a most confusing fashion, but who cares about what's going on, anyway? The word Samurai is interchanged with Ninja in this story. The cast includes such characters as The Princess, Necktie Ninja, pantsless Samurai, unloved lady ninja, Elvis Samurai, The Evil Queen, the old lady who tears her own face off, and a bevy of poisonous women. Throw in tentacles and glowing blue balls, and the MST3K-style jokes happen all on their own. For ease of comprehension, all you need to remember is that the way of the Samurai is death, and expect a final deathcount of Shakespearian proportions+dvd
He-Man rules+P+If you are a He-Man fan then you will love the X-Mas special. This is one of the best He-Man's yet+dvd
Artillery, Saddam Hussein and the Mossad = Gulf War+P+This is the true story of Dr. Gerald Bull played by Frank Langella in a simply excellent performance.  Kevin Spacey is fantastic as a CIA agent with heart.  Tony Goldwyn, son of Samuel Goldwyn (i.e. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer - MGM) is perfect as the "true company man" for the White House NSC.  Alan Arkin, a long-time favorite of mine, plays an Israeli colonel turned into a Mossad agent.  And the characters playing the Iraqis are really, really good.  Get the movie.  It's pretty factual and quite amazing indeed.  Here's a few additional facts about the story to intrigue you:  Dr. Gerald Bull was the founder of Space Research Corporation.  A Canadian ballistics expert, Bull modified artillery weapons, worked on the USA's HAARP gun program and upgraded SCUD missiles for various customers. He did work for every country, except Russia, which he hated (but the SCUD's he modified were Russian-made). He also did work, through the CIA, for the USA and some of its allies.   His modified SCUD's rained down on Israel and Saudi Arabia, killing Israelis and American troops.  Dr. Bull had to run things through the customs services of many countries of course to move his weapons. He ran afoul of U.S. Customs and got a year in a federal penitentiary for which he did not forgive the CIA, instead expecting immunity.   Bull was contracted by Saddam Hussein, who at that time was a pro-U.S. interest (against Iran and supported by then-Vice-President Bush) to build a "Supergun" that would fire a 2,000 lb shell over 100 miles (and further). Saddam's hope was to be able to shell Israel with bio/chem weapons from an artillery gun (which is not uncommon) but from great range.  Israel had destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor (designed to produce weapons-grade plutonium) for which Saddam vowed revenge.  The Mossad gave a lot of warnings to Bull about helping Iraq arm, which Bull repeatedly ignored.   the CIA and British MI6 turned a blind eye to Bull's operations in Iraq, for which Bull, expecting protection, gave them info on the German bunkers and C&C centers Saddam had constructed underground. Ah, but in the spy business there are no sweethearts, and the Mossad assassinated Bull in Brussels before he could finish the "Supergun" (the Babylon Gun). A smaller version, the "Baby Babylon" gun had been completed and tested at that time.  However, in the movie they give the suggestion MI-6 assassinated Bull as they show a silencer being screwed onto the barrel of what looks like a Walthers PPK.  This was all financed through a "bank" in America where funds were diverted from American taxpayers to Saddam, ostensibly for agricultural enterprises.  Saddam reportedly paid Bull $25 million for his work.  The myopic viewpoint at the time was that any enemy of Iran (i.e. Iraq) is a friend of the USA. Didn't quite work out that way.  After Bull was dead, MI6 feigned surprise at the discovery of "Supergun" barrel pieces being constructed in a foundry in England and they were impounded before they could all be shipped out (on Iraqi IL-76 transports I believe). Some pieces did make it out to Iraq.   Thus the silly and complicted politics of the Middle East. Where the USA once propped up the Shah of Iran and sold him 79 F-14A Tomcats, he was deposed and Iran became a U.S. enemy, and still is to this day.  Saddam, a former protected entity, invaded Kuwait less than 6 months after Bull was assassinated, on August 2, 1990 - and the rest was seen on CNN 24 hours per day+dvd
Funniest Office Comedy Around+P+If you've ever worked for a corporation and dwelled in 'cubicle city', then this one's for you! You have to watch this movie. Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston are excellent in this film. It's taken from the "Milton" shorts and is absolutely hilarious+dvd
The Best Comedy... EVER!+P+This movie has been my #1 Comedy for many years... still is... and most likely will continue to be for many years to come.  It speaks to anyone "raised" in a cubicle - you will find in almost all the characters "someone" you knew at some point in your life, when you worked at "so and so".  So many real-life scenarios I felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days!  And every time I've watched it (and yes... that number is in the "double" digits) I always find something that I overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again, as if for the first time!  A true gem!  Feeling blue?  Just pop this movie... you'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours..+dvd

Just Say No, Cuz!+N+This movie provides ample proof that LSD usage does affect the minds of the unborn. Grateful Dead legend Jerry Garcia's daughter made this amateurish home video. While the topic of genetically modified foods is interesting, this video comes off as terribly one-sided hatchet job on the biotech industry and U.S. agriculture, in general. Monsanto is the main target of this film's attacks, but no one from the company is ever allowed to respond to the claims that it is trying to monopolize the pesticide and seed industries by buying up potential competitors and registering for patents on thousands of genetically engineered plant products. Instead, we're treated to the overzealous opinions of a few blowhards who don't have any idea of how to encourage research, development, and innovation in agriculture. The vague term of "biodiversity" is mentioned as some kind of virtue, but no explains its benefits. Actually, everyone is allowed to whine in this movie, from farmers to activists, but no one is ever allowed to respond to attacks. In one sequence, a farmer criticizes Monsanto. In another sequence, the U.S. government is criticized for subsidizing farmers (nevermind that every major industrial power subsidizes its farmers). Why not ask the farmer if he's dependent on government handouts, and how he justifies such subsidies? Why should farmers be immune to criticism? Please, let's get into the mix a little bit, and get to the bottom of these controveries!+dvd
Definitely an interesting film+P+I feel very fortunate to have been able to grab a promo copy of this film.  It is a rather dark look into the life of someone who could be your normal 'shy guy'.  However, this one's got a secret that he's now got to punish himself for.  The movie moves a little slowly, but definitely gives itself time to build up the characters (not hard, considering it's focused on 'Roman' (Lucky McGee), who gets almost all the screen time).  By the end of the film, I was really starting to feel for the character and hoping to see things go his way, despite his issues.  I have watched this movie a few times now, and will be continuing to do so quite a few more...and am looking forward to the regular DVD release so I can check out the bonus features.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves horror, as well as general fans of Lucky McGee or Angela Bettis.  Glad to see another good one come out+dvd
Around The World With Superman+P+As someone who loved this wonderful series during the 50's and in sindication in later years - I still love it today - at age 51. As many have said - it seems that George Reeves was the one and only person to portray Superman. He had the charm, charisma, the classic fine features, sense of humor, as well as very appealing vocal and acting qualities many actors today I'm sure - wish they had. And of course - that wonderful smile of his that few could resist. I have read that he was a very nice person to work with on the set and was always very sensitive and kind to others. However - I'm not sure if everyone out there who loved him in the role knew how much he loved children and how much he did for them. I've heard and read many interviews about him and his portrayal of Superman and how he would devote many hours entertaining sick children in hospitals as the man of steel. Many children indeed - looked up to him as their own Superman and the great and wholesome role model he portrayed. "Around The World With Superman" the last episode in the second season dvd, very nicely shows George's sensitivity and love for children as he tries to help a young blind girl regain her sight and takes her on a once in a lifetime flight around the world - in his arms. When he first visits the girl in her mother's apartment as Clark Kent and as Superman - with the aid of the wonderful background music that made the 50's series so memorable and enjoyable - one can clearly see George Reeve's love for children in his voice and the things he says to her and way he looks at the young girl.  Indeed - a very touching and sensitive episode, and in my humble opinion - a very nice and memorable tribute to George.    +dvd
Beautifully done Hollywood history-humorous poignant+P+I have seen this wonderful film in Hollywood, New York and Wasington D.C. and it never disappoints. There is so much in it that it is always interesting and a joy to watch. There are many fascinating  persnalities--both the Chasen's staff and old Hollywood personalities-and  they are portrayed with amazing sensitivity, humor and intelligence+dvd
Absolute Garbage+N+ZERO STARS, BUT THAT ISNT AN OPTION...-So lets say, "F" for effort... Let me start by saying I love the horror/gore genre, but junk like this needs to be put to an end...at some point enough has got to be enough...this "movie" was shot using a canon xl (at best)...apparently film was out of the question...the acting is miserable, the camera work and lighting was a joke...and the violence and gore was laughable...and I dont mean laughable like outrageous...but laughable because it is that bad...hack editing ruins every death scene...the only real gore comes in the form of various characters spitting gallons of blood after altercations...the highlight of the "movie" was a dude putting a melon on this dude head and then shooting a 9mm through it...as if things couldnt get any worse...these clowns didnt take the time to sync the dialogue to the lip motions...AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS...you have been warned..+dvd
"You'll be the first one I'll tell when I'm in love"+P+Everyone, just once in their life has probably had fantasies of pistol whipping or perhaps even punching out at least one member of their family, but the embattled title character Ethan Mao, in maverick director, Quentin Lee's saga of Asian American gay dysfunctional angst gets to do this and so much more.   A whole film about holding your family to ransom by gunpoint may not immediately strike viewers as the stuff of a great story, and may even be a little bit much for most, but Lee manages for the most part to hold this film together, delivering up a tight, taught, if not terribly low budget package that mixes elements of the psychological thriller, coming-of-age drama, gay love story, and even black comedy.  Ethan Mao is certainly overly ambitious in its themes and crude in its execution, but there's a gritty and solemn earnestness to this movie, that lifts it above the usual dramas of teenage angst. What makes this movie worth viewing and so involving, and perhaps also so groundbreaking, is that it depicts a modern, urban gay Asian-American teen, which is something that to my knowledge is very rare in film.   The story takes off when the title character Ethan Mao (Jun Hee Lee) has just been kicked out of his home after Abraham, his father (Raymond Ma) discovered his stash of gay porn. His family is reasonably wealthy having worked hard over the years, now they're the epitome of the immigrant success story. But Ethan's father has made the fatal mistake of putting money before the love of his family. Now his days are spent catering to Ethan's gangly younger brother Noel (David Tran), a bullying and spoilt stepson Josh (Kevin Kleinberg), and Sarah, his slinky, narcissistic, ex-actress wife (Julia Nickson).   Obviously being gay doesn't sit well with Mr. Mao, so Ethan is promptly ejected from the family and immediately - without exploring any other options - adopts the life of a homeless hustler, eventually meeting Remigio (Jerry Hernandez), who also works the streets. The pair develops a fierce friendship based on love, trust, and loyalty. Remigio feeds Ethan, gives him a home and surprisingly keeps his hands to himself. Ethan, for his part has a lack of affect, which presumably signals an emotional numbness.  Ethan enlists Remigio's help to return to his home to pick up his belongings as well as a necklace belonging to his dead mother, but his family, who are supposed to be on a Thanksgiving outing, come home.  A vicious argument ensues, with the two young men holding the group hostage until the necklace can be retrieved from a safe-deposit box the next day.   From here, the film mushrooms into an unlikely hostage melodrama, complete with guns, uneasy family dysfunction, along with lots of emotional recriminations. Josh, the stepbrother hates Ethan, and Ethan hates Sarah, the stepmother, while M. Mao remains appalled at what his son is doing, but at the same time begins to regret the way he's treated Ethan, and the rest of his family.  As the hours progress, Ethan begins to enjoy his newfound power and uses it to tell everyone in the family, especially his uptight and highly traditional dad, exactly what he thinks of them and how he feels he's been mistreated. Meanwhile, Remigio looks on, remaining a silent, and somewhat reluctant witness to the proceedings, and a loyal friend to Ethan.  Ethan Mao is clearly heartfelt and sincere- and an early robbery scene is particularly strong - but ultimately a facile script hampers the film, along with its low production values and its bargain basement, C-grade acting. It is also essential that the viewer feel some sympathy for Ethan, but his decision to freely participate in the hustler lifestyle, when you know a boy as bright as he could do something else, makes it hard for us to really root for him. Ultimately, he comes across as a bit bratty, spoiled, and sad; he should learn to lighten up a little, even if he does have a mean father and a wicked stepmother.  Despite Ethan Mao's obvious shortcomings, the film has an intensity and fervor that is impossible not to like. The film also works as an offbeat tale of love and friendship; Ethan and Remigio, through no fault of their own, have become a couple of devoted urban hustler outlaws. Thank goodness though, that we are subjected to only one of Ethan's elderly and flabby customers. Mike Leonard November 05. +dvd
Dated and dull+N+Uncut magazine from England  rated this 5 stars and DVD of the month. They also claimed the Coen Brothers paid tribute to it Big Lebowski. This was enough to make me shell out the bucks and buy it.   Imagine my dissapointment. The picture and sound quality were dire. Too much contrast in the video and the sound had to be turned up super loud to follow the dialogue.   The movie came across as just another viet vet/counter culture exploitation movie with a trite plot that hardly went anywhere and never engaged me or made me feel any suspense. Dialogue was dated and cliched.   I'll never trust an Uncut Reviewer again. Don't waste your money on this one+dvd
Message received, invitation declined+N+A run-of-the-mill hired gun oater told from the hired gun's point of view.  Yul Brynner stars in INVITATION TO A GUNFIGHTER, a western with a conscience from 1964, a bad time for westerns made in the lower 48.  Brynner plays Jules Gaspard d'Estaing (Jewel, for short,) a silk-shirted top-notch gun for hire who's enlisted by a small southwestern town to shoot George Segal, a young man returning from the Civil War who, much to town owner and chief psychopath Pat Hingle's horror and disgust, fought for the Confederacy.  Segal returns to town bereft of farm, stolen--- er, claimed and sold by Hingle while he was gone - and sweetheart Janice Rule, a New England lass who married a one-armed piano player out of pity.  After Segal tries to take back his farm, rather forcefully and impulsively, Hingle's hatred for all things southern boils over and he hires one of the best guns in the lawless west.     At some point in the movie Brynner's character observes that this cowed frontier town is filled with hens (Civil War widows) and capons (injured vets of that war.)  It can be ruled by anyone with enough moxie to take it over, and hence we're given the reason why Hingle's character is named Brewster - well, it rhymes with rooster, anyway, and his penchant for quoting and paraphrasing passages from the Bible is Hollywood's shorthand way of telling us he's either a fraud or criminally demented.  In any event, the slave system  Segal may (underline and italicize the word `may') have been fighting to protect and defend is clumsily contrasted with the Hingle-led town's treatment of women and resident Mexicans.  Neither can vote in town councils, the Mexicans can't buy ammunition to kill game to feed their families, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.     Which reminds me, Brynner ain't half-bad as the suave and conflicted gun slinger.  It probably goes without saying that there was only one man, recently returned from the war, who treated the resident Mexicans with any respect.  That fact doesn't escape Brynner's attention, anyway, and it sets up the Big Conflict - does a hired gun let outside factors interfere with his contract to kill?  INVITATION TO A GUNFIGHTER would have been a whole lot better if it hadn't tried so hard to prove the town's moral hypocrisy, if it hadn't spent so much time developing a sticky romantic quadrangle between Rule, Brynner, Segal, and the One-Armed Man, and especially if it hadn't loaded a simple story with so much `message.'  Westerns, and action movies in general, work best when the connection between motivation and action is simple and direct.  In ItaG that connection is hopelessly, and needlessly, tangled.  Brynner has a lithe intensity that rises above the material and almost, but not quite, carries this movie along with him.+dvd
What do people see in this show?+N+I purchased season 1 and thought it was so-so but then as I started watching repeats of seasons 1 and 2, it dawned on me that this was one terrible show. I think the acting is poor (but that could be the fault of the scripts and/or the directors). Speaking of scripts, could the dialogue and scenes be any weaker? Invariably, on each show one of the agents will come into the scene and say "I have a lead on the car (or phone number). I'm going to check it out." Exit scene.  I just can't believe that real FBI agents act like this quintet. LaPaglia's hair is long, then regulation, then long, then . . .well you get the idea. If there is an actress more sorry than Marianne Jean-Baptiste in a lead role, I have yet to meet her. Also, why are these two so argumentative with the relatives or friends of the missing person. I'm thinking especially of the father of the autistic boy who went missing in a museum. And if it is a husband or wife who went missing, then invariably the question is "Was he (she) having an affair?" and "Are you having an affair?"  Poppy Montgomery, an FBI agent? Come on. First, she has an affair with her supervisor (LaPaglia). Then she jumps into bed with one of her co-workers (Eric Close). Not in any FBI that I know.   At least Close and Enrique Murciano look and act like agents (and so does Montgomery, when she is out of bed) but they are handicapped by weak scripts and direction.  There are better series out there. Buy those. Don't buy "Without A Trace."  +dvd
IT COULD HAPPEN!!!!+P+This movie is AWESOME!!!!!! When future generations use this movie as their blueprint for living, they will recognize the untold wondrosity of Roger and JP's relationship, the acting debuts of Matthew Mcaughany and Adrien Brody, and a sparkling star turn by Delmot Mulroney as the deadbeat dad.  Not to mention noted thespians Tony Danza and Danny Glover!!!The following are some sparkling lines of dialogue.  "IT COULD HAPPEN!!!"---stated 7 different times  "IT'S GOD'S THUMBNAIL!!!"--JP  "THE FOOTPRINTS OF AN ANGEL ARE LOVE!!!"---Maggie  "UHM, DAVID, WHERE ARE THE NACHOS??? I'M SAVING THEM FOR LATER!!!"---JP and Davi+dvd
Don't waste your money!+N+Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it+dvd
Robert Altman, fresh off his hit 'Mash' made this great+P+film.  Terrific use of lighting and camera work.  If you like HBO's 'Deadwood' series you'll see where they got there story line here.  Leonard Cohen's songs fit perfectly with the story.  Cohen, so it goes was very taken with Altman's work on 'MASH' and after 'McCabe' was finished gave the song's to Altman to use.  That's right gave.  He didn't take any money for hits like 'Sisters of Mercy' and the 'Stranger Song'+dvd
It killed an evening that needed to die, anyway.+N+Thank God I borrowed this one from the library! Every time I saw a spinning propeller I thought of what my WWII veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes. I couldn't even enjoy the battle scenes because of the technical anomalies and anachronisms. It did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped+dvd
And stay out of New Hampshire !!!+P+I was enchanted by this comedy/drama when I saw it as a youngster, and I must say the enchantment has not been diminished by time.  A wonderfully directed and filmed Faustian story, quintessentially American in tone, both its content and style were remarkable for those times, over 60 years ago.  It is played with a light touch despite it's deep and atmospheric(and marvelous) cinematography by Joseph August and it's often moody score by Bernard Herrmann.  Of course one wonders if the film would have the same buoyancy and sense of fun, despite the dark themes, if any actor played Mr. Scratch other than the truly wonderful Walter Huston.  He is simply terrific here, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission.  Countering Huston's sly, mischievous, grinning Devil is another great character actor with the gravitas to match him, and that's Edward Arnold as Daniel Webster.  I like the opening credits wherein director Dieterle lists all the behind the scenes talent without titles, including himself, and at the end states " who collaborated on this film".  It is truly a collaboration with director and cinematographer and composer and editor (Robert Wise) all on the same page.  It has some striking moments, most especially the first encounter with Belle (Simone Simon), the ghostly dance at Jabez Stone's mansion, and the final eerie trial.    The supporting performances, especially the always reliable Jane Darwell as Ma Stone are fine.  James Craig as Jabez Stone was a bit of a stiff, but the movie's overall qualities compensate for him.  Simone Simon is luscious, and the honestly presented depiction of her adulterous relationship with Jabez is quite daring for the times (one wonders how it got past the Hays office).  This came out in 1941, and Arnold's stirring defense of Jabez  that exhalts all things American in the land and character of it's people may strike some as corny, but this was made on the cusp of World War II, and these things needed to be said then, and in a lower key, some of which wouldn't hurt us to be reminded of now.  And, finally, there is the last great shot of Huston's Scratch eating the stolen peach pie and then musingly rubbing his chin as he looks out directly at us in search of his next victim. Perfect.+dvd
Great movie, but ...+P+This is a ridiculous price. I would have bought this long ago, but the price just stays at that ridiculous price. I haven't seen the film in years, and would really love to watch it again. But for this price, that's nuts. I paid less for some film collections. What in the world is Criterion doing by asking for so much money for this?+dvd
I Liked It Very Much+P+I rarely watch American TV anymore because of the chance to see crime drama at it's best like the "Touching Evil" series.  I have epals that I share my favs with and visa-versa.  The "Touching Evil" series was recommended by an epal because of it's intelligent drama.  I rented it, for the lowest price, of course, just in case it wasn't worth the cash.  I really liked it.  I do have my favorite episodes, though.  The first episode, "The Lost Boys" of the series and the first episode in Series 3.  Series 2 and 3 do not have specific episode titles, so I call this one, "Hearts".   "The Lost Boys" introduces Detective Inspector Dave Creegan(Robson Green) to us.  Creegan is volitile, yet brilliant.  He had been wounded in the line of duty, which was followed by psychiatric counselling.  It makes one wonder why ACC Enwright(Michael Feast) called him back into service.  Creegan's emotional volitility caused the breakup of his marriage.   After getting to know Creegan as a character, the audience can see why.  Creegan is a "driven" man and has instincts that can see through the mask of a criminal as he does in "The Lost Boys". Creegan sees through the mask of university professor Ronald Hinks(Ian McDiarmid-Sen. Palatine from Star Wars).  Creegan fights with Enwright and other team members to get Hinks arrested for kidnapping 3 boys, but Hink's lawyers have a larger case for Creegan's harrassment of Hinks.  Creegan is teamed up with DI Susan Taylor(Nicola Walker), Detective Sargent Jonathan Kreitman(Adam Kotz) and Detective Constable Mark Rivers(Shaun Dingwall).  There is conflict almost immediately between the team members.  I would like to see a 4th "Touching Evil" series, if only to clean up some questions before ending this intelligent series.  My biggest question, of course, is "Why did Enwright bring Creegan back in the first place?"  Creegan made it clear that he was a "one-to-one" person and that selling ice cream would probably be the best job he would enjoy AND he was psychologically unstable.  There is also the question of why Taylor was picked to partner with Creegan.  "Hearts" is just plain brilliant.  All the actors are at their best in this one, but Robson Green stands out.  After the murder of a friend, he finally crosses that psychological line.  Green is brilliant followed by Andy Serkis(Dr. Michael Lawler).  The other actors follow closely behind.  Do I recommend this series.  YES, but only the British one.  When we Americans try to recreate a wonderful program like this, we always fall short+dvd
Intense, Brooding, Chilling Mysteries+P+Without doubt the Touching Evil series is, along with Prime Suspect, Wire in the Blood (also with Robson), one of the finest mysteries ever developed for television. Once again British television leaves its Stateside counterpart in the dust when it comes to creating a well-reasoned, educated yet infinitely watchable &quot;who-done-it?&quot;     Robson Green's Creegan has a intensity that is deeply affecting and eminently watchable. Just shy of being over-the-edge, Creegan is instantly likeable yet worrisome; like an old friend whom one is justifiably concerned about. Yet he's not so &quot;out there&quot; that we find it difficult to identify with him. Quite the opposite.     Nicola Walker is his perfect partner, D.I. Taylor. Like the best entertainment, Touching Evil isn't a one man show and while the major burden may fall to Robson, he is surrounded with a rich and varied supporting ensemble with a genuinely stand out performance from Shuan Dingwell as D.C. Rivers.     I'm glad to see Season 1 finally making it to DVD! Dare I wish for &quot;Touching Evil IV?&quot;    p+dvd
Really Great  Movie That Is Still Fun+P+Like a lot of people, I remember this movie fondly from when I was younger, and this movie is still really fun. Unlike remakes that are made now, this took a classic film and put its own twist to the story. The acting is good, but what really stands out to me is the sets and costumes, especially when they make it to the city. The entire scene when they are watching the people sing about Green, Red and Gold is really cool to watch. The songs are also very memorable and really catchy. Overall, this is a cool movie that can still be enjoyed by anyone, it is really a classic.+dvd
Hips, tighs and Abs+N+It is ok I think but too many tools are needed to do it properly. I travel a lot and can't take things with me all around, so don't use it much but if you have all the tools at home it is effective. The abs section is at the end and very short too, mostlly focused on hips and tighs+dvd
Beware of this company+N+Never buy anything directly from this company.  Only buy it from Amazon.  This company will use your credit card for things you did not order and refuse to credit you.  I ordered a sample of their whey protein with my order.  They sent me a whole box of it and expected me to ship it back to them at my expense, or I would be charged!+dvd
Confusing, slow, and sub par acting+N+Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie.  The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short.  But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to.  Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me.   +dvd
Dramatic Thriller+P+Debra Winger plays a detective who is on the trail of a psychopathic woman. She quickly meets, "falls in love" and then marries her man, but soon kills him before moving onto the next man repeating the process all over again. When the detective finally locates her in Hawaii, she meets her and the two become friends. As she investigates the woman's web of lies and murder, the woman becomes suspicious of her. When she finally discovers that her friend is a detective, it becomes a deadly rollercoaster ride as she repeatedly tries to kill her. Some of the best scenes were... poisoning the wine scene, the scuba-diving scene, the scalding shower scene, and the end scene+dvd
The ties that bind--and break.+P+Roger Michell's "The Mother" ranks with "Cries and Whispers" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night" as one of the most unpleasant, profoundly disturbing portraits of a dysfunctional family ever put on film. It is also undeniably brilliant at showing the frayed knots of family loyalty that only need one good shock to break irrevocably. Hanif Kureishi--an old hand at making audiences squirm--tells the story of May (Anne Reid), a sixtyish housewife in a semi-rural English town, visiting her children in London with her husband Toots (Peter Vaughan). Ten minutes into the movie, Toots dies, leaving May totally at a loss. As the film makes plain from the beginning, May's life has revolved entirely for decades around caring for Toots. At first we think the film will be a poignant study of a woman's grief. May doesn't want to go back to her empty house, but her children plainly don't want her around: her son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) is a cold, self-centered businessman, and her daughter Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a needy, whining neurotic who blames her mother for nearly everything that's gone wrong with her life. We think the story will be about May's learning to stand up for herself and make a new life. (When Bobby asks May not to be difficult, she stiffens and asks, "Why shouldn't I be difficult?") But then May meets Darren (Daniel Craig), Paula's sexy, moody boyfriend and a man half May's age, and from then on all expectations fly straight out the window and land with a crash. I wish the publicity for the film didn't reveal what happens between May and Darren, but even so the impact of it assaults the audience like the punch in the face Paula eventually gives May. If the movie were just about an elderly woman's sexuality, it wouldn't be so shocking; what shocks is May's selfish betrayal of Paula, and the brutal fashion in which Paula discovers it. At that moment we lose all our moorings as an audience, and have no idea who among the characters to side with, if anyone. We still have sympathy for May--as we don't for the patently hateful Paula, Darren and Bobby--but we also gasp in horror at her heedless behavior, and get an idea why her children turned out the way they did. "The Mother" is hard to sit through, and also hard to forget.+dvd
I know she was here+P+Alfred Hitchcock wasn't too good at straight-out comedy, which he only did once. But he was absolutely brilliant at clever, witty thrillers, one of the earliest of which is "The Lady Vanishes." While it has some major plot holes, Hitchcock makes up for those with witty dialogue and solid acting.  Iris (Margaret Lockwood) is having a last girl's-night-out with her best friends, at a small Alpine hotel. As she's leaving on the train, she befriends a kindly little old governess (Dame May Whitty) -- who vanishes while Iris is napping. Even worse, everyone denies that the old lady existed, making Iris wonder if she imagined the whole thing.    She enlists the help of eccentric musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to help her find the old lady, once they are both convinced that the lady existed. Now the pair must go through the train in search of the old lady -- but they never expected to uncover an international conspiracy, which could leave them all dead.  "The Lady Vanishes" was a pretty early movie of Hitchcock's, and at the end we're left wondering about several oddities in the plot (how is an eighty-year-old lady so athletic? How inept can those foreign agents BE?). As a spy thriller it's flawed but passable... but it's very good as a comedic mystery.   Hitchcock takes his time introducing us to these characters, by having them all bunk at one overcrowded hotel. One particularly funny scene has Gilbert invading Iris's suite, after she has him ejected from his room, and strewing his things all over as she orders him to leave. But Hitchcock also captures the claustrophobic feeling of being menaced on a train.  As well as the feisty socialite and weird musician, the movie is sprinkled with cricket-obsessed Brits, ebullient hoteliers, and bickering adulterous lovers. They all do fairly solid jobs, with Redgrave as a charming, slightly odd standout. And they all get some entertaining dialogue, no matter how stodgy they are. ("My father always taught me, never desert a lady in trouble. He even carried that as far as marrying Mother.")  You'd expect Criterion to do the best job with this film. But in terms of quality for your money, I found that the Diamond Entertainment version is pretty good. The picture is fairly clear, neither too light nor too dark, and the soundtrack is clean except for a slight crackle in the opening credits. Not too bad for a mere four dollars.  "The Lady Vanishes" is a comedic mystery that doesn't quite work as a spy thriller. But it's still an entertaining, taut little movie. Definitely a keeper+dvd
EXCELLENT BEGINNER VIDEO AND MUCH MORE+P+I found this to be a valuable collection for my dance library. The first segment teaches what many instructors fail to teach- orientation and smooth transitions early, this video will guide you easily. Transitions from left to right are created by  teaching the pivoting of the foot almost magically, creating smooth and graceful dancing, no more boring dancer, learn to dance for all your audience, not just those facing you! The cross step with use of the arms over the head and framing the head,taxsim which is much overlooked, hip pushes, beautiful traveling hip circles,undulations.The second segment teaches a funtastical drum solo,easy to learn. It is easy to add to this choreography and make it more challenging.There is so much in this video,  learn to flow gracefully or bump to the beat of the drum, let beautiful Neon guide you into a spellbinding journey of this mystical dance. Overall, I totally enjoyed the quality of this video and the only improvements I would make would be the backdrop or setting which needed color. Learning from a video is easier in my opinion if the instructor faces a mirror or works at an angle and the student follows along. Overall those are minor compared to all that is offered+dvd
Well, that was dreadful.+N+I only bought this DVD, because I'm a rabid Jason Isaacs fan, and I'm intent on eventually seeing everything in his IMDB listing, but yeesh.  This was just painful.  The only good parts were Jason as Clark Devlin and Debbie Mazar as Steena, and those parts were entirely too brief.  In fact, there is a much, much better movie featuring those two particular characters implied in this forgettable little piece of nonsense.  I really wish I owned that movie.+dvd
Boooooooring!!!!+N+I don't care what anyone says, this movie is painfully boring.  I love war movies but not this one.  Cheesy and too oversimplified, some of the worst acting ever.  If you want to know about this little known subject, read the book.  It is MUCH better+dvd
Great Video for kids+P+Our 3-1/2 year old will watch this 24/7 if you let him.  Great fun for the kids (which is nice for mom & dad too+dvd
A perfect gem of filmmaking+P+This film is an artfully crafted vision of the old west.    By any measure one of John Wayne's better movies.   I really can't feature this movie being made with anyone else in the lead.  He fits the character like a glove as a tough gnarled and aging rancher.  Roscoe Brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook.  His was a Oscar caliber performance.  In my book, this picture has Bruce Dern's best performance as an evil doer.  His psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel.  And despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it's concept-    Cowboys herding cattle that are really boys, facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can.  Casting the cowboys they used a mix of Hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills.  This worked out incredibly well.  The script is tight and the movie does not have one flabby moment.  To top it off- the musical score is by John Williams.  All of these things converge to create a perfect gem of filmmaking.+dvd
Add To Cart.... NO!+N+This movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas. Anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life. The plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those Silver Shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that ANYONE can make a movie.   I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids+dvd
Give me a break+N+This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker+dvd
Wet Willis' for everyone!+N+Welcome to a new style of reviews.  For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring.  Today marks a day of change.  I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing.  Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans - but for me, it is still all about the cinema.    War, really people, what is it good for?  Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film "Hart's War", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his "luxury" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.   Did I hint towards "The Great Escape" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes "Hart's War" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, "You can't handle the truth", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.  How bland.    "Hart's War" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?    Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, "oh brother!".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.    This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved "Fallen" so very much.  "Hart's War" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.        So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?  To my reply ... absolutely nothing.    I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give "Hart's War" a  (wait for it ...)  BLAH+dvd
A film that is TORTURE to watch!+N+I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but I guess if I had really thought about it, anything starring Joan Crawford at this point in her life, and the always rebellious/troubled/angry John Garfield, could not have risen above what the film ended up being. My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, "okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her "sorrow and pain"! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad. I am sure die hard Joan and John fans will always love this film, but all others should be able to see it for what it really is+dvd
The Incredibles+P+I was in Wal-Mart and saw some scenes from this movie and instantly wanted to watch it. This is a very funny movie. It plays on all the ultimate dreams of children and some of us adults. The storyline is one of a kind. I am glad that Pixar came out with this movie. I was especially intrigued by the youngest son. He made movie that much more enjoyable. So for anyone out there looking for a good family movie to watch and you havn't already seen this one, than go and pick it up right now. You won't regret it.+dvd
hahahah halarius+P+This movie is stupid. Yet most of Leslie Neilson movies are. Thats what makes them funny!!! This is halarius. He does a great job on doing his part in the movie, and the last seen is the funniest you will ever see+dvd
Beware+N+This may be a good movie.  However, I can't tell because the DVD they sent me was a "Region 2" version that won't play on U.S. DVD players--or at least not on mine.  If you buy this, be sure you're getting something that will work on your equipment.  Otherwise, like me, you've wasted your money+dvd
Bad Quality of DVD+N+Very disappointed with the DVD quality, it is even worse than any new VHS tapes. Even at the first time I played it, some part was not able to play. I wish the DVD/CD purchasing policy covered the case how to handle defect DVD/CD. Contents do cover a lot bellet movements+dvd
Panning mania to the extreme but why???+N+What is up with this director desire to do overlapping and panning camera shots? I mean if you going to use it a few times, as pointless as it is...no problem but for every scene? C'mon now...aint we getting a little carried away here. I was dizzy after the first 5 minutes and still manage to watch the whole movie which is a feat that i challenge anyone here to take. You would most likely turn the movie off within 10 minutes and burst out profanities in the process.     The only reason i watch the whole thing not because i wanted to know about this sick killer's multiple personality defense interview but the person who was giving the interview, the ultra hot Brittany Daniel. We went gaga over her role as the devious temptress in Dawson's Creek but as a 70's chick doing the interview....OMG! It almost seems like she was enjoying the fantasy about this guy based on her expression and body movements. She was dress to kill with that 70's disco outfit. The movie scenes was accurate to the times which is a plus.  Still it was a badly directed movie with horried camera work and the dialog was bad too(accurate or not) that even the lovely Brittany cannnot save. Not recommended even if your a fan of the Hillside Strangler. And if you are...seek help!   +dvd
The importance of not being too earnest...+N+I really wanted to like this film.  It hurts not to recommend it, because the subject matter is extraordinary and compelling: a once-in-a-lifetime night in American theater that happened during the Great Depression.  And Tim Robbins' heart is in the right place.  But great intentions don't make a great film, and unfortunately, that's the case here.  Robbins tries to do a multiple-character loose plot that makes one think of Robert Altman.  In fact, watching Cradle Will Rock, you realize just how good Altman is, because he makes this sort of thing look so effortless (so much so that detractors have often accused him of "not really directing" his pictures).  Well, to quote the late senator Lloyd Bentsen: Tim Robbins, you're no Bob Altman.  The film has an impressive cast list.  Unfortunately, almost everyone overacts (or is overdirected by Robbins, since these actors have turned in other fine performances).  Particular violators are Cary Ewles as John Houseman and Angus Macfadyen as Orson Welles.  Both seem to channel Nathan Lane in their over-the-top elocution and both as directed by Robbins turn every showbiz cliche in the book, such as bickering pettily and then, when they reach an agreement over something, jumping up and down and shouting "Eureka!" while hugging.  Other hams include Ruben Blades as painter Diego Rivera and, surprisingly, the normally spot-on Susan Sarandon as Mussolini's art-living mistress.  (With her over-bearing accent she sounds more like Count Dracula's mistress.)  Other cliched characters include doe-eyed Emily Watson as a shy waif who never gets a break in life until, of course, the last scene.  There's also a strange sideplot involving Bill Murray (okay, he does not overact; *can* Bill Murray overact?) as a washed-up ventriloquist.  This started off promising, with him attending secret meetings sponsored by alienated conservatives who see the times changing in ways that make them uncomfortable, but it really went nowhere in my opinion.  Conversly, the third (third!) major plotline, about Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera to paint a mural in his new building, went predictably where we'd expect, and was way too drawn out in the film's ending.  Oddly, for a screenplay that cried out for lots of oddball, nonconformist characters, no lines and little face time are given Corina Katt Ayala as Frida Kahlo--who in real life was quite a character who could have been put to better use here.  Also underused is the always-reliable Bob Balaban.  Hank Azaria is okay as the playwright, but the whole surreal bits that happen whenever he has a scene to write or perform strike me as Robbins trying to be arty and "profound."  The one standout performance is by Cherry Jones, wonderful as Hallie Flanagan.  Her warm and very natural performance just throws into high relief how forced and phony most of the rest of the cast is.  Even here, though, Robbins misses the point.  The high moment comes when Balaban shakes her into reality after the Congressional hearings and tells her "It's over."  That could have been the beginning of a big dramatic scene, but Robbins glosses over it for a phony and smug mock-interrogation in the court chambers--preaching to us like we're third graders who can't be trusted to figure it out ourselves.  Similarly, the walk down the street to the second theater that begins the climax could have been a big dramatic moment--what will be the fate of this controversial play, and the actors who have rehearsed it for months?  Instead Robbins gives us a victory dance before the victory--a parade of jugglers, acrobats and cha-cha dancers set to comical klezmer music that undermines what he's just set up.  We feel a satisfaction and--I hate to keep using this word but it's true--smugness, before the big night even happens.  And I'll leave it to you to decide the effectiveness--and the ultimate meaning--of the very last shot.  I still haven't decided if it works, but it was a bold idea.  Another big part of what sinks this movie is the hammy score.  It may seem piddling to talk about background music, but it really breaks the movie.  The music was done by David Robbins--Tim's brother.  Nepotism rears its ugly head.  Robbins' music is usually inappropriate--slapstick and overly broad like the rest of the film's elements, as though Robbins doesn't trust us to follow him and feels he has to drive home his message with power tools.  Yet despite the constant heavy-handedness, Cradle Will Rock never finds its tone--part history lesson, part "serious drama," part broadsided "comedy," it can't ultimately decide if it wants to hit you in the head with a hammer or in the face with a pie.  It tries both by the end, and neither works.  Ultimately, I felt like Robbins couldn't get a distance from his material.  He lectures us to the point that the word MESSAGE in bright red practically flashes on the screen.  Understatement is not in his bag of tricks.  It's not that I disagree with much of what he has to say, but he fairly hits you over the head with it, and acts as though he's the first one to show you upper-class hypocracy.  The one really interesting plot thread--about how the Hallie Flanagans of the world were called before the House UnAmerican Committee to defend their loyalty while the Hearsts of America appeased dictators by buying art from them (and thereby financing their fascism)--is the highlight of the film.  But even here Robbins stages a garish costume party to drive home the point and again whips out the power tools.  Tim, we get it.  Despite this negative review, the film might be interesting to see just for the fascinating history lesson that it is.  Or you could go online or to a library and find some nonfiction material on the subject matter.  I read somewhere that originally none other than Orson Welles himself was set to make this film, but the deal never got off the ground and then he died.  That's too bad.  I would like to have seen what he could have done with this material.  As it is, Robbins is too close to it--too loud, too preachy, too self-righteous--to pull it off.+dvd
There is one secret......+N+This DVD has very little to offer and even at its attractive price, it's a waste of money.  Granted, I have done reading on meditation for years and have practiced sporadically.  Still, I don't believe you could get much less from a DVD than is available on this one.  There are detailed instructions on posture, hand position and the like.  That takes about three minutes.  I was very disappointed in the lack of in-depth instruction I would have expected from a DVD on meditation. +dvd
Redneck extravanganza on a ...Budget+N+This a dreadful example of what Jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers. The only reason to watch it would be because Mamie Van Doren was also in it.But be aware (and i read that in a biography about Jayne) that in their contracts was specified that they would NOT appear together in ANY scene whatsoever.So you see them SEPARATELY in different scenes.Also be aware that if you blink,you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties.

The Future As We Know It+P+The Future Is Wild takes a peek into the future as we know it. There are three discs. The first one is set five million years into the future. It is the middle of another Ice Age. There is an introduction and four episodes. Every other disc has four episodes.   Episode 1: Return of the Ice Shagrats stuggle to survive as they are stalked by hungry Snowstalkers. The Shagrat looks like a cross between a capybara and a lemming. The snowstalker is a white cat with sabre-tooth like fangs.  Episode 2: The Vanished Sea The bottom of Europe and the tip of Africa has come together, blocking off the Mediterrainean from the Atlantic Ocean. This has caused all the water to evaporate, only leaving a salt flat.On this salt flat lives a family of cryptiles, lizard-like animals that run on two legs. Islands, have become small patches of land covered with crevases. On the crevases, lives the scrofa, a pig-like animal that is in constant danger.  Episode 3: Praries of the Amizonia The amazon rainforest has died out and become a vast plain. On these plains, Karakillers hunt in groups to track down the Babookaris. Also, the rattleback has evolved from various marsupiels and has formed a fire-proof exterior.   Episode 4: Cold Kansas Desert The rattleback is also making a stand in the Kansa desert. A bird species called the spinks, has adapted to underground life through the raging sandstorms. Also, the deathgleaners hunt for them on the surface like bats.  The second disc travels 100 million years into the future to find out more about the corse of evolution.   Episode 5: Waterland The octopus family is taking its irst crawls onto land. The new name is the swampus. Their nest are located in plants, wich are in consistant danger of being toppled over by Torutons. Torutons are 120 ton creatures that feed on 1,323 pounds of food a day. Surprizingly, there closest relatives today is the tiny tortoise.  In the water, the lurkfish is always wating to shock its prey with 1,000 volts of electricity.   Episode 6: Flooded World This episode is set in the shallow seas of the future. Many, many jellyfish have formed together to form the ocean phantom. In the ocean phantom's tenticles, the spindle trooper is always ready to get the food. By food, I mean the reef glider.  Episode 7: Tropical Antarctica Antarctica has come north to the equator. As a result, it is covered with lush rainforests. These rainforests are home to spitfire beetles and spitfire birds. The flutterbird is also a welcome guest to this new Antarctica.   Episode 8: The Great Plateau A great blue windrunner dominates the high altitudes of the new plateau. The plateau was formed when Australia when north and struck North America and Asia. The great blue windrunner is a four winged bird that  relys on the silver spider for food. The silver spider relys on the last mammal ever, the poggle, to give them food. They feed the poggle until it is fat enough, and then they kill it and feed the poor creature to the queen.  On the final disc, The timestream eccelerates to 200 million years into an alien world.  Episode 9: The Endless Desert 100 million years earlier, a massive asteroid impact wiped out 95 percent of the Earth's life-forms. After the world recovered, Pangea II became the new land mass. The endless desert was home to a veriety of creatures like the terabyte, and antlike insect thet shot sticky goo at its prey. Its prey, meaning the centapede-like garden worm, was helpless. In the water, the gloomworm and the slickribbon live in a bloody world.  Eisode 10: The Global Ocean With one landmass, there was one ocean. The ocean flish flew over this ocean and fed on the common silver swimmer. But the food chain dosn't stop there. The rainbow squid feasts on the flish and the Sharkopah considers the rainbow squid a delicacy.  Episode 11: Graveland Desert This world is home to a one legged snail called the desert hopper. These creatures share their desert home with a menagerie of other aliens including the deathbottle, the grimworm, and the bumblebeetle.   Episode 12: Tentacled Desert In this final episode, squids have evolved to immense sizes, and have moved onto the land perminantly. The megasquid is a perfect example. This beast is larger then an elephant! Though it is huge, its flaw is that it is not very smart. Its treetop dwelling relative, the squibbon, is very social and very smart. This species could even trigger another civilization...  This is the exact reason that the future is wild+dvd
The fine line between the actor's stage and reality is murder....+P+Here's a memorable Oscar-winning performance from one of Hollywood's finest actor's, Ronald Colman, in a story of jealousy, madness and revenge.  In a role that was originally intended for Cary Grant, Colman is excellent as Anthony John, a celebrated off-Broadway actor who blurs the line between his character, Othello, and reality when he starts acting on the murderous impulses of his character.  As a psychological melodrama, "A Double Life" undoubtedly stands out as a success.   George Kukor's direction is exemplary as he successfully juxtaposes Tony John's real jealousy over his ex-wife's relationship with Edmond O'Brien, while mirroring the wracked emotions and madness of Shakespeare's protagonist.   Colman convincingly protrays Tony John's progressive dementia from the get-go the minute he is offered the part soon after the opening credits roll. For an actor used to playing debonair and  swashbuckling heroes in the 30's this role must have been a challenge for Colman, but a welcome one.  He brings a nervous intensity to the character of Tony John that is never melodramatic but is realistically portrayed.   Co-written by the talented actress, Ruth Gordon (Harold & Maude), "A Double Life" showcases an impressive cast including Shelley Winters (in her first professional role), Ray Collins, and Signe Hasso.   The score by Miklos Rozsa, as well as the screenplay by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, are both as memorable as the performances in this remarkable film. This DVD's transfer is markedly clean and lovingly restored from the original film negative and presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the the film was initially shot.+dvd
Brother, Can You Spare a Dime is a Great movie+P+My name is Amanda and I'm in a 10th grade world history class.  We are currently studying the Great Depression and WWII and we have just finished watching Brother, Can You Spare a Dime.  This movie helped me to understand not only the culture and life of this era but also helped me to understand the things that led up to the Depression and Stock market crash as well as Pearl Harbor and WWII.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants an entertaining way to learn a bit about history+dvd
Rare collection of early cinema at a very good price+P+This set consists of 40 short films and series photographs shot between 1894 and 1913. Arranged in roughly chronological order, with the earlier pieces subdivided into categories ("Edison Kinetoscopes," "Lumiere Films," "Actualities"), they present an overview of the early silent era of motion pictures. Most people have seen stills or excerpts from such films as "A Voyage to the Moon" and "The Great Train Robbery," but seldom have people had the chance to experience such pioneering works in their entirety. This is not a disc for everybody. Only those who have a keen interest in the development of motion pictures at their earliest phase will appreciate it. If you are one of those, like me, consider this a must buy.   In addition to scripted comedies and dramas, there are a number of films that simply record everyday life at the turn of the last century. There is "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat", which is said to have panicked early audiences who failed to grasp that the approaching train wasn't going to come through the screen and run them over. Other films, such as "Snowball Fight" and "Seminary Girls" are staged with the intent of creating the appearance of spontaneity. Either way, these rarely seen films are important documents of a recent past that is so different from our present that it's hard to believe that they were shot only a century ago.   The Dolby Digital mono sound is clear and well presented. Many of the films are tastefully scored with newly recorded piano music, while others are paired with period recordings. "Skyscrapers of New York City From North River," for example, is particularly haunting when viewed with its mysterious, unidentified musical accompaniment drifting from the speakers. A good number of films in this collection date back to the 1890's, and a lot of them are a lot better looking than I would have thought. Some films, like Train Robbery, even have their original hand painted color tints intact. One of the neat things about the DVD is the freeze frame, because I was able to spot a single frame in one of the Kinetiscope films that was slipped in to read "Copyright 1907 T.A. Edison." This is not a disc that's about features, other than being able to zip from film to film versus fast forwarding on VHS, nor is it one to show off your home theatre. This is a film for those with a serious interest film history only+dvd
KICKBOXER 5 THE REDEPTION+N+VERY DISSAPPOINTING,HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KICKBOXING SAGA,A PRODUCTION THE COULD OF DONE WITHOUT,DAVID SLOAN DIES.........LOL.COMMON REALLY EVEN I COULDNT BELIEVE IT,SEE THE MOVIE FOR A GOOD LAUGH,NOTHING ELSE+dvd
I've seen so far the first three episodes+P+I love the X-files, I was in my Grad school at the time it came out so I missed the first three- four years. This was a great way to see them all. I'm a Si-Fi kinda guy so this was easy to buy. I hated when it got cancelled. It's great to see the beginning and to now understand what's going on and the history behind Foxes obsession. The products I recieved are great and nice to know I can recieved them with an APO address. thank+dvd
WHO'S FOOLIN WHO+P+Credit has to go to the people behind APRIL FOOL'S DAY.  Eschewing the typical slasher formula, the movie plays like an update of TEN LITTLE INDIANS.  A group of college students are invited to Muffy St. John's island getaway for a weekend of fun and foolishness.  The writers set up the fact that there are some practical jokers amongst them, so when real murders start, the viewer has to wonder if they aren't jokes, but they seem too real for the frightened crew, and hostess Muffy has started to act like she's missing a few raisins in her muffin.  Although it starts a little slowly, once it picks up, it has some neat suspenseful moments and a predictable but enjoyable climax.  Deborah Foreman, Ken Olandt, Amy Steel, Jay Baker, Clayton Rohner and Griffin O'Neal head the cast, and it's fun for a change of pace slasher/suspense flick+dvd
A bit disappointed+N+I was not happy with this DVD.  I purchased this DVD because on the back it said the 2nd kickboxing workout was approximatly 120 minutes..in reality, it is only 40 minutes.  I was looking for a longer workout and was not happy spending my money...felt a bit cheated+dvd

Two Good Pairings+P+This disk contains two westerns, both staring Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. The pair works well together in very different roles.  The first is a comedy and the second is a drama. In the first they are buddies, in the second they are enemies. In both, they are splendid.  Individual reviews appear below:  THE CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUB This One's a Hoot  Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda play a couple of cowboys working on the range. When Stewart gets a letter he is surprised to learn that his bother has died and left him his business. It is a placed called the Cheyenne Social Club. So it is that Stewart and his sidekick, Fonda, set out for Wyoming with the expectation of becoming respectable business men.  Upon arrival, Stewart learns that he is the most popular and respected man in town. He also learns that his social club is a brothel. This strikes him as not being "in his line of work" and he determines to close the place down. That takes him from being the most respected to the most reviled man in town. He has some hard decisions to make and even more trouble appears when he learns that there are contractual agreements between his shop and the railroad. Things get more complicated still when he learns that there are some ruffians roughing up some of his girls.   Stewart is just a nice guy trying to do the "right thing". Eventually, he does...much to his own surprise.   FIRECREEK Sometimes the Little Guys Win  This is another pairing of Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in a western.   Stewart plays a farmer, respected by his peers and given the honorary title of sheriff in his town. The tile also comes with a home made tin badge and 20 dollars. It is a sign of esteem and nothing more.  Fonda plays the leader of a group of gunmen with vague notions about law and order. When passing through town, they decide to stop there a little while and rest. Nobody really minds that but they do object to being treated like vermin by the gunmen who get a bit wild when they drink. Fonda does not really approve of what they do but is reluctant to come down on them too hard for fear of alienating them. That means that it is up to the sheriff to keep order.  Keeping order is a hard job. He is not trained and he is certainly no gunfighter. He is just a farmer. The townspeople encourage him just to ignore things in the hope that the bad guys will eventually go away. All are frightened. When a friend is lynched, though, Stewart decides that enough is enough and takes on the whole gang.  This is one of those films in which the little guy manages to stand up to the bully, survive and even win. It comes at a cost, though.+dvd
The Great Muttering Sailor Man+P+Opinions are like noses: everyone has one. Some like it, some don't. Let me say this, however, in defense of this 1980 movie starring Robin Williams as Popeye. It is certainly unfair to say, by any stretch, that this is 'the worst movie of all-time', or 'one of the worst...'. It is funny how, at the time of this writing, that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars...Actually that is about right. For those who do not know about the wonderful website called The Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), you really need to check it out. [...] My point is this: There are many opinions. So if you have never seen this movie, decide for yourself. Do you remember the incredible muttering Popeye (done by Jack Mercer on the cartoons)?. I'm talking especially about the early Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons from the 30's. You know, the ones in black-and-white. That's what I loved the most, the muttering Popeye. Well, Robin Williams does it superbly! Also, Shelly Duvall is excellent as Olive Oyl in this movie. Granted, the story is kind of bland. The music is not always top notch. Yes, it is too long. However, I enjoyed watching Robin Williams' masterful portrayal of everyone's favorite Sailor Man. Sure, Olive can get a little annoying at times, but wasn't she basically that way in the cartoons? So if you loved the muttering Popeye, then you'll love the movie, overall. Never mind the story. The storyline doesn't really matter, I feel. But, alas, you say you cannot really remember those vintage Popeye cartoon shorts too well. Not to worry! They are scheduled to be released on DVD... FULLY RESTORED!!! Volume 1 (1933 - 1938), with a July 2007 scheduled release, will have, in my opinion, the very best of all the 230 total Popeye cartoon shorts. (Incidently, William Costello provided Popeye's voice from 1933 until sometime in 1935. He was very good also, but the really GREAT muttering came when Jack Mercer took over in 1935). By all means, if you are a huge Popeye fan like myself, then you absolutely must get these DVDs. After listening to the great Jack Mercer, and watching the incredible animation in those early years, then compare Popeye to Robin Williams' version. I dare say, you will see the similarity. So, the bottom line is: See for yourself. If you love Popeye, the character, then you will not be disappointed with Robin Williams' performance. The movie itself... well, you be the judge. Likely you have a nose, so without a doubt you, too will have an opinion. It's ALL alright.    +dvd

Not for DVD aficionados+N+I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now+dvd
Why was this movie set in Wisconsin? +N+I usually like romantic comedies, but this one was for the birds. Maybe the robin, our state bird here in Wisconsin. Then again, maybe not, since this movie seemed to get ALL the Wisconsin stuff wrong.  People outside on Thanksgiving in just long sleeves? Not where I live. I mean, they could have chosen from about ten other midwestern states if all they wanted was that 'naive farm girl meets big-city boy' feel (which is lame and predictable, by the way).   I like Julia Stiles, and the young man was okay, but getting the local stuff wrong was a turnoff, and it really kind of took me out of the movie.   Tsk tsk.+dvd
A Good Value+P+This is, in effect, two related but different movies packaged together for marketing purposes. Both are funny and being offered together makes them a bit more affordable. Reviews of both appear below.    SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF  James Garner always does a great job in playing acerbic comic roles and his role in this one is no exception. He plays a man who is hired as sheriff in a gold rush boom town and who takes the job seriously enough to clean the place up. He does so with wit and charm and the bad guys never no what hit them.   Bruce Dern plays the first guy he arrests. He is a bad one but not to bright. This is a good thing since the bars for the jail have not been installed yet. Walter Brennan plays Dern's father. He is the head of the outlaw family but just can't seem to get his way with the sheriff. His performance too is a delight. Jack Elam plays the deputy and Harry Morgan plays the mayor. All do a wonderful job.   There is always something to laugh at in this one.    SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF was a comic masterpiece and cried out, at least in terms on dollars and cents, for a sequel. So they made one, only it wasn't  Almost all of the cast from the SHERIFF appear in GUNFIGHTER but they all play completely different characters. Nothing is the same except that it takes place in the west and is funny, but not as funny as the original.  James Garner plays the role of Latigo Smith. He is a man on the run, not from the law but from a woman who expects to marry him. He goes to ground in Purgatory, a mining town. His arrival is noted by the owner of one of the town's two competing mining companies. They think he is a gunfighter hired by the other company. He's not but sees financial opportunity in the confusion. He passes himself off as the agent for the gunfighter (less danger and stress) and cons a down on his luck cowboy into playing the part of the gunfighter.   This is not a movie filled with excitement or drama. It is a comedy. It is not as funny as SHERIFF but it is funny in its own right.+dvd
Stan and John Create Surface Tension+N+This dvd first caught my eye with high expectations and a low price.  The price turned out to be too much.  Stan Lee and John Buscema are two of the greatest comic book creators that have ever lived, but this dvd just isn't good enough to meet their standards.  It offers much in the way of comic book jargon, but displays each business element very poorly.  The main focus of this "visual" video is verbal instruction.  There is a very limited amount of important hands-on drawing, barely even enough to teach a learning artist anything.  I think that HOW TO DRAW COMICS THE MARVEL WAY could have been done a lot better and should offer a great deal more.  Unless you are an avid comic book fan, I do not recommend purchasing this dvd.  And, even if you are, I would give it some serious thought+dvd
Maximum Acceleration+P+There is very little not to like about THE FLASH.  A super hero, lightning speed, and evil villains.  Best of all, the Flash appears on and off throughout the episode.  This is quite a change from those cheesy super hero television series of the 1970s where we were limited to a glimpse of our hero only twice during the show:  Once during the first 20 minutes and again in the final five minutes.  THE FLASH was a natural extension of Warner Brothers' success with the BATMAN motion picture.  In fact, THE FLASH shared many of Tim Burton film's elements:  A darker superhero, most of the stories taking place at night, and Danny Elfman music.  Comic book loyalists were quick to point out the deviations from print, but given the choice it was better to have THE FLASH for one reason than not at all.  CBS premiered THE FLASH during the 1990 - 1991 television season. As numerous reviewers have reiterated, the show was doomed to fail because of CBS programming mismanagement.  The early 1990s was a time when ABC, CBS, and NBC still held most of the cards as "The Networks."  As Networks they crowded their programming line up with series, sitcoms, mini-series, sporting events, and specials.  THE FLASH was often displaced from its time slot so often that fans could not keep up with it.  At times it also aired at the same time as other popular shows such as THE SIMPSONS and THE COSBY SHOW.  Contributing to the show's demise was that the first Gulf War, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, was constantly in the news and a regular source for special news reports.  The show should have been awarded a second season, but CBS had zero tolerance for low ratings.  A couple years later THE FLASH probably would have found better success on FOX or CW.  Alas, it was not to be.  Thus it was that I was surprised by the show when it appeared on the British satellite station Sky One in 1992.  At that time Sky One was also beamed to continental Europe and provided an additional, and sorely needed, English language television channel for US military personnel in Germany.  Unfortunately I was not able to catch the whole series.  By the time we added a satellite dish to our German apartment balcony THE FLASH was only a couple episodes away from finishing its run on Sky One.  A couple years later I stumbled on two video cassettes of the series, the pilot episode and a "movie" assembled from two episodes involving The Trickster, and was able to enjoy a little more of the series.  The DVD set is very affordable.  If your remember the series from 1990, now is your time to order the DVDs and enjoy them at your liesur+dvd
HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE+P+It was just as I remembered it. I had a good time watching it with my daughter.She can't believe what we use to think was scary.  Laur+dvd
VERY anti-Christian+N+The movie has many none-too-subtle *VERY* anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing "Christian" TV Evangelists and Christians themselves as stupid zombies; life as basically pointless.  I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm -- DON'T BUY IT!!+dvd
No spanish subtitles???  We're insulted.+N+We're huge Monk fans, but how could they tear-out the Spanish subtitles for Season 4?  This is an outrage and an insult. We're two hugely disappointed fans.  Tony, make it right, please+dvd
139 body count--some appear to be the same+N+After Romero's &quot;Dead--movies&quot; as well as &quot;Dead Alive&quot; and &quot;Bad Taste&quot; this movie is rotten.No real plot,and no characters with any depth.The director calls it art.This is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it's really good.We are told that there are 139 deaths, but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.Comic Books do better than this.I guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.The most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman's mouth.This mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.Italians seem to do better with crappy gore than Germans+dvd
Starts well, comes crashing down+N+In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.  It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.  He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.  The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.  The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying "What the hell is going on?"  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.  Besides, the ending sucks+dvd
Ignore the ignorant jibes...this film is truly outstanding.+P+I've just endured an unpleasant half hour trawling through the myriad reviews of "Grand Canyon", that are so misinformed as to be laughable.  Aside from the fact that the New York Times may have awarded this the "worst film of all time" (in a year that "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" was released?? - please!) I find these attitude of such reviewers quite lamentable.  Grand Canyon is a magnificent film - and absolutlely NOT just the purview of "New Agers"!  Anyone who has studied film to even a marginal degree will recognise the greatness in Grand Canyon. No, it's not "The Godfather"... yet it is still one of the finest films of its time.  To those it touches (and there are many), it is unforgettable.  Kasdan had a vision that was unfortunately ahead of its time (and still appears to be in 2006, judging from some of the reviews here!).  Certainly not "The Big Chill", Grand Canyon is a far more nuanced work - to those who understand its subtleties, it is sublime - to those still struggling to comprehend the mysteries, magic and meaning of our existance here, I can see how it might appear impenetrable or pretentious.  That is no fault of the film itself - just as "Deuce Bigalow" is speaking to its chosen audience of prepubertal adolescents, so is Grand Canyon attempting to connect with those humans who choose to delve beneath the flimsy facade of modern existance. To the opinion-makers, it will naturally slip under their radar; don't let that be a reason for you missing this unmissable film.  To anyone considering this film, I implore you - do not be distracted by the inane ramblings of posters who wouldn't understand a truly meaningful film if they fell over it.  Grand Canyon is for a select audience - it will never be widely popular; as if that were any true marker of what is important!  Grand Canyon stands tall as one of the great achievements of the 1990s - watch it, and be moved.  Watch it, and see a reflection of the world we currently find ourselves in - striving for answers, yearning for meaning... and looking all the while for the magic that defines our existance.  Absolutely five stars+dvd
The Frieza saga begins....+P+and it is really good. This DVD is great cause it continues where the Namek and Ginyu sagas left off and sets up the Frieza saga. It is a great segway. This DVD also resolves some things left from the Saiyan saga. Alot happens but i wont ruin it for you. You really should buy this DVD but buy it with Frieza: Transformation for a real treat+dvd
Emerald33+N+If I had seen this in the movies, I would have walked out and asked for a refund.  It was indescribably terrible.  I returned this DVD because I really, really didn't like what I saw+dvd
Bound ( A movie you bound to have ).+P+If  Drama, suspence, a little humour and an impressive story line is your thing, then you are BOUND to like this movie.  Two  ladies ( sort of ) swindles the mob over two million dollars...drama unfolds from the begining throughout the movie keeping you at the edge of your seat. P.S warning there is a little lesbian scene that deterred my mom from watching the whole movie ( however this was early in the film )+dvd
Ted Wass is NO Closeau+N+Curse of the Pink Panther is weakest entry in Panther genre.  One, Peter Sellers as  Chief Inspector Closeau seem to take the spirit of the Panther films to the grave with him  Two, This was the last Film of David Niven. The rumor of Rich Little dubbing his voice rings true, if you watch Niven's lips and what is coming out of them.Niven who was very ill with MS just did a lot of sitting and limited movement.   Three, Ted Wass tries to bumble and stumble like Sellers's trademark character-however He is NO CLOSEAU. The more he pratfalls, the most we miss and wish Sellers were still alive  Four, the supporting cast (Robert Loggia, Herbert Lom, Leslie Ash, Robert Wagner, Joanna Lumley, Capucine, David Niven, Harvey Korman) are given almost nothing to do in this film, other than to be a foil to Wass's pratfalls or straight men to Wass's so called craziness. Burt Kwouk  as Cato is given more to do in his small scene with Wass and you wonder why he isnt in more of the film. And Roger Moore's cameo as a remade Closeau is poor preformance, playing on Seller's trademark accent and his James Bond Character  Five, Blake Edwards's script seem a weak closure to the Genre. And to make matters worse, he even did another Pink Panther (Son of the Pink Panther)after this,  which was WORSE than this film   AND THOSE ARE THE GOOD POINTS  I give it two stars for the stellar supporting cast alone, that makes this film worth it  Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORL+dvd

Best Batman Made Yet+P+This is by far the best Batman movie. I give Batman Returns and Batman Begins a lot of credit, but you can't beat the cast assembled for this movie. The combination of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is incredibe, and Kim Basinger, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance make a good supporting cast. The story is excellent, with plenty of action. Tim Burton could not have directed this movie any better, creating a dark and eerie feeling throughout the entire movie. Overall, this movie is superb in every category.+dvd
Brother Review+P+I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, but I found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-Soviet Russian life. It showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself.   The movie was also an interesting discussion on morality. Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man.   The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas. There was also the family dynamic; his brother was willing to put Danila's life in danger. Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Overall, the movie was entertaining. It was heavy, but with a few lighter spots so the viewer doesn't get overwhelmed.+dvd
I just found this sad+N+I've always loved the Smothers Brothers - they were so gifted, so funny.  But like so many show business people, they fooled themselves into thinking they were more important, more informed, and had greater insight into life than everyone else.    What is it about a singer or comedian or actor that makes them think they have a firmer grasp of politics or foreign policy than those who have spent their lives studying and working in the field?  This show just highlights that sort of egotistical celebrity folly - they sacrificed their sweet funny comedy act so that their political opinions could be heard - and all it accomplished was to make sure we didn't get to hear their funny comedy OR their political opinions!  Why don't more entertainers just listen to Laura Ingrahm when she says -"Shut Up and Sing!" ?  I quit watching the TV show when they got political and this program reminds me why I did.+dvd
A taboo subject handled superbly by Malle+P+Louis Malle's sensitive and delicate look at sexual initiation. Set in 1954, Benoit Ferreux plays a 14-year-old boy from Dijon; his father is a cold, uncaring gynecologist; his mother (played brilliantly by Lea Massari) is a free spirit. He contracts scarlet fever, which cause a heart murmur, and goes with his mother for a cure to a hotel/spa. He meets some girls there, and Massari openly sees a lover; she doesn't hide anything about this from him - in fact, she openly solicits his sympathies when she leaves her lover rather than go off with him. Massari's and Ferreux's closeness is gradually developed until they go to bed together. This act of incest is a special moment for both, and Malle must be praised for not exploiting it or making it sordid. Massari, as I said, is excellent, and it's not an easy role to play. The movie is both a commentary on the vapidness of the French bourgeoisie and an affirmation of life on a personal level. There is also a great Charlie Parker musical score. A wonderful movie all around+dvd
Hellhounds on my Trail: Lost Scent+N+&quot;Hellhounds on my Trail&quot; is a disappointment. The legendary Robert Johnson, perhaps the greatest blues musician in the history of this country, is unseen and effectively unheard in this collage of generally mediocre performances by admirers and wannabes. In fact, the two weakest performances in the film are the opening and closing sequences. The only insight which comes through clearly here is the vast gulf in talent between Robert Johnson and his imitators+dvd
The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller (Tarzan the Ape Man / Escapes / and His Mate / Finds a Son / Secret Treasure /+P+Arrived in good condition+dvd
The original... the best Tarzan of all!+P+Without a doubt, Johnny Weissmuller's interpretation of Tarzan is the best of all! An excellent swimmer, Johnny Weissmuller makes the swimming scenes seem effortless and believable. Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane provides elegance, as a gentle yet brave and courageous woman, who falls in love with a man, king of the jungle, and yet completely unaware of civilization. The house Tarzan builds for her is a marvel of progress, with the latest technological advancements... in a rudimentary... simple... basic construction. When Edgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan he played on our survival instincts, and surfaced the innate fears of confronting savage beasts, and yet, the fantasy that we can become friends with all jungle creatures.   Tarzan and His Mate - Simply best in class. It explores how life should have been for Adam & Eve... in love, living in paradise, respecting nature, and living in complete harmony with the environment. Not spoiling and accepting the simple things offered by our planet Earth.    Tarzan Escapes - From civilization, Jane's cousins visit the Mutia Escarpment, only to realize that she has found true love, family, and home in Africa. The marvel of the home created by Tarzan is highlighted, with the elephant-powered elevator becoming a fascinating process to watch.  Tarzan Finds a Son! - Here we meet a new addition to the family, played by Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Both Tarzan and Jane now have a play pal, and he does a magnificent job at allowing the audience to see how we can grow up in this environment and learn survival skills that keep him active, healthy, and self-assured. Great for a younger audience, adding fun and adventure to this wonderful set.  Tarzan's New York Adventure One of the best scenes ever filmed is when Johnny Weissmuller dives off the Washington bridge, and makes it all look possible, doable... and easy. What precision! This movie is fun and Cheetah provides many a laugh. The struggle between good and evil are played to perfection in this series, where those in search for profit and wealth, are always trying to take advantage of the many natural treasures that surround Tarzan's simple life, and it is rewarding to see how the hero never gives in to avarice, defending and maintaining his world in its natural state.   We loved the set... and when we visit the zoo... or go to the Circus... we find ourselves looking at elephants and monkeys and saying... "Simba... ungawa!" "Simba... ungawa!" Would highly recommend acquiring this set+dvd
Are You Serious?+N+I watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter, and regretted it about 10 minutes in.  After reading Queen Bees & Wannabees, I can't help but despair whenever I look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world.    In Barbie's envisioning of this world the central theme is to "be yourself", but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping, chasing each others' boyfriends, inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football, and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star.  While I realize that this is teenage girl reality, is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint?  The popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls, so it's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the "popular lawn" is really clear, other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing.  But at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it's like to be on the outside looking in.  Of course, there's the "magic diary" aspect of the story, which seemed the only tie to the "other" Barbie world (Fairytopia, Mermadia, et all).  I realized then what I was really watching...a marketing cry for help from Mattel.  The target demo for Barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls, and they're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like Bratz are chipping away at.  I promptly dumped all Mattel stock from my 401k.+dvd
Top Speed?  Unlimited!+P+Loved the great "Real Time" high performance footage and legitimate sound effects. This little known flick is right up there with Bullitt and Vanishing Point as far as the action driving sequences go. I'm thrilled that it has finally been released on DVD. If you're a Mopar fan, it's a must have for your car chase collection.+dvd
AT LAST ON DVD! The magnificent Muni in the Oscar winner!+P+Sadly forgotten today, Paul Muni was one of our finest actors. He triumphed in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, earned a Best Actor Oscar as Louis Pasteur, and let THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA to win the Best Picture Oscar of 1937.  Don'r pass up this magnificent motion picture+dvd
Wish it didn't end:+P+I loved the series Kindred the Embraced. It taught me a lot about the differant types of vampires.  I really wish it didnt end. I wanted more of the story. It also had a love story involved. All round good series.+dvd
Description VERY Misleading+N+This is NOT a story about Black River Falls, as the description indicates.  It is a film about stories from around Wisconsin as reported in a paper from Black River Falls, with some hokey footage of modern (1990's) day Black River Falls.  There are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what I can only call "modern art".  Cut out about 20 minutes of "filler" and this would be a somewhat better film.  Basically, it's a collection of "strange but true stories" that have no connection to each other, except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of Wisconsin.  And the modern footage makes no positive contribution at all.  In fact, if I was from Black River Falls, I would be upset about how the town is portrayed.  A complete waste of time and film+dvd
THERE IS NO OTHER LIKE "FREAKS"!+P+This is really a one of a kind movie. Creepy atmosphere abounds in this carnival freak show setting, the use of real "Freaks" adds greatly to this bizarre tale of revenge. The DVD transfer is very good and a worthy purchase.+dvd
pretty bad+N+A lot of talking, not much doing.  The teacher is annoying!! PLease save your money, all the other reviews must have been written by her+dvd
SUCKS.+N+Garbage. They tweaked it in every place that didn't need tweaking. Straker is no longer bald, Matt Burke is no longer caucasion, and now he's gay. The bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea. In this adaptation, Ben Mears was the kid who found the bodies of Hubie Marsten and his wife. The story begins in winter instead of late summer. Ralphie Glick doesn't just go missing, he's drowned in an icey pond. Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm. Could it have been filmed in... oh I dunno... AUSTRALIA PERHAPS?+dvd
One of the Worst Remakes Ever...+N+Truly it is. I watched it once, and then just yesterday and it still was painful to watch. Not because of the acting necessarily, although I think Kidman is one lousy actress in any of her films and this one is no exception.   But the story...what happened? Seriously in the beginning it's not so bad. Yet the middle and end begin to terribly fall apart- especially since in one scene they're saying one thing and then saying a completely other thing in another scene. Basically we're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives? And somehow the chips disappear in the end and they become their real selves again? Then they make a real huge twist in the end which I guess I shouldn't give away but is just real tacky I think.  Just...a mess of a film. I don't know what happened, but it really fell apart in no time. If you're interested in the story, then watch the old one- that sticks to their story all the way through very well. This remake though avoid seriously.  1/+dvd
One of worst movies ever made+N+It is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one.   Personally I can not blame him. Throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes, (note I am the most un pc person in world so if I am put off it says somthing)  and an apperance by larry king, and and you have everything wrong with american movie making.   Please note- Jon Lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turke+dvd
Outlaw all post-release editing.+N+This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned+dvd
Legend of the Lost+N+Although I am a dedicated fan of John Wayne and dearly love his movies, I found this movie, which I have never seen before, to be slow and for lack of a better word boring. I will view it again and add it to my collection because John Wayne is in it+dvd
Leaves an impression Zero Woman rocks!!!+P+Miki Sugimoto is absolutely gorgeous and strong as Rei, Zero Woman, a different brand of cop that will do anything to put away scum. After she murders, the first secretary of the Embassy whose really a rapist lowlife, she gets put in prison. The President's daughter gets kidnapped and the cops desperate to get her back bring back Rei to do the job they can't do.  Amazingly over the top exploitation mixed with decent acting, a nice soundtrack and special effects. Rei has her moments as well rubbing it to people who really deserve it. She's without pity and compassion and when you see what happens to her you realize why. This is a great guilty pleasure that really needs to be seen. Only five reviews so far? Anybody whose reading this review who hasn't seen it needs to go out and buy it+dvd
More Dis-unity+N+Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films..."Color Purple" , "For Colored Girls...." etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we "work together"...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen..+dvd
Boring+N+About as instructive as a sex ed tape from high school.  Do not recommend+dvd
Oh the humanity!+N+No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. "Carrie" is probably the best example, followed by "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Dead Zone." These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.  "Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return" introduces us to Hannah (Natalie Ramsey), a young lady heading back to the now infamous Gatlin, Nebraska in order to answer some important personal questions: why am I drawn to a town out in the sticks? Who is my mother and where is she? Will accepting this role in a schlock, straight to video clunker enhance my career opportunities? You can quickly grasp the metaphysical importance of such ponderings. In quick succession, Hannah runs into a string of problems. Pushy town cop Cora (Alix Koromzay) gives her sass before she even arrives in town. Doc Michaels (Stacy Keach), the town quack, insists on imprinting his own weird impressions on the girl. But the most bizarre occurrence confronting Hannah during her first visit to Gatlin is the sight of a short man hooked up to a slew of machines in a hospital. This figure is none other than Isaac (John Franklin), the original apostle of "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" in the first film. Apparently, the boyish preacher did not perish at the end of "Children of the Corn," although it sure looked like it then, but slipped into a deep coma that has rendered him helpless for all these years. The arrival of Hannah, however, fulfills an old prophecy that will see Isaac out of his coma and possibly bring about a reemergence of the corn demon.  As "Children of the Corn 666" progresses, not so much in a linear manner but in a serious of jerky fits and starts capable of inducing whiplash in the viewer, more of the "storyline" emerges for our consumption. It appears that many worshippers of "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" survived the Peter Horton induced apocalypse at the end of the first film and grew up. They've been waiting all these years--raising their own children and acting like responsible adults--for Isaac to awaken from his slumber and call forth the demon. Why? I don't know. Since cult members always considered anyone over the age of eighteen the enemy, I can't imagine why grown people would welcome the malevolent corn god with open arms. Wouldn't he just pop up out of the earth and rip every person with age wrinkles and five o'clock shadow into bloody pulp? The whole subplot involving Hannah's reunion with her mother Rachel (Nancy Allen) withers when confronted with fundamental questions the movie refuses to ask, let alone answer. It should go without saying that numerous individuals find the idea of a possible Isaac/corn devil reconciliation an unpalatable situation. These are the people who end up on the wrong end of scythes and other sharp objects.  What we have here is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise. So many characters parade past the screen, from Gabriel (Paul Popowich) to Jake (William Prael) to a dozen others that it's impossible to keep it all straight. Only the presence of the attractive Natalie Ramsey and the very gorgeous Sydney Bennet in the role of cranky Morgan help keep this film down on stomachs made queasy with banalities. John Franklin, who also co-wrote the script, doesn't do much beyond what he did in the first film. Sure, he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences, but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this isn't the Isaac we remember from the first film. Is it possible for the chief apostle of a demon to collect Social Security checks, particularly when said demon makes it a point to hype the virtues of youth? Like I wrote earlier, there are more questions here than answers. By the time the film shudders to a halt, all I could bring myself to praise was the gore, and there is precious little of that floating around compared to other entries in the series.  The DVD contains no extras, which is just as well because that would require the viewer to spend more time with this no account film. I suggest you skip, forget, overlook, reject, condemn, avoid, cast off, jettison, exile, dump, burn, pass over, disregard, denounce, discard, and abandon "Children of the Corn 666" as quickly as possible. Rearrange your sock drawer, change the furnace filters in your house, or reattach those plastic thingies to your shoelaces--do anything you can think of to avoid this atrocity. If you must see it, good luck and may god be with you.      +dvd
Another King Masterpiece Butchered+N+I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better.+dvd
greatest 70s crime, tough guy show+P+the 70's get a bad rap. they brought us disco and sideburns but also spawned great movies & television. sanford & son, archie bunker, happy days, the jeffersons and, yes, the Rockford Files.  Man I loved this show. Garner is a guy's guy, no blown dry hair like CHIPS or Magnum PI. Just a tough guy doing his job as a PI. The slew of great characters (Angel sticks out) are a precursor the Law & Order franchise. And who could forget the cheesy theme song+dvd
How could anybody enjoy this?+N+"Problem Child" has made my top ten worst movies list.  How could anybody enjoy it?  "Problem Child" paved the way for Little Monster movies.  In its footsteps would come "Clifford," "The Good Son" and more recently, "Are We There Yet?"  In this genre, children are little sadistic monsters who stop just short of killing their adult supervisors and cackle maniacally.  Usually, these movies are billed as "comedies."  In this one, this kid could have a tea party with Damien from "The Omen" and Samarra from "The Ring."  He's not funny, he's not charming or cute; he's a scary little creature.  Plus, are we supposed to think it's funny that his idol is a serial killer?  That he writes letters to him?  That the serial killer comes to visit and "takes him away," therefore putting him in danger?  That the father proves himself at the end by battling the killer and rescuing the kid?  Horrible, cringe-inducing stuff.  The filmmakers should have had a long discussion before making "Problem Child.+dvd
Very unusual for Hollywood+P+I finally bought this movie recently and watched it last night and all i can say is..... FANTASTIC ENTERTAINMENT! Forget all the bad reviews in the press when the movie was in cinemas, this film is very good indeed.  If you like non stop action and i really do mean from start to finish, and if you like cgi special effects, and explosions, and weapons, and monsters etc, then you will love this movie. It's a simple tale of good Vs evil, nothing more nothing less.  It is pure entertainment, great fun, great value at under six quid and it's a film you will want to watch again, trust me+dvd
A Curiosity+N+This DVD is a good way to see what Houdini looked like.  That's it for the positive side of this review.  The story is ridiculous, Houdini does no magic and only one escape.  That escape is so poorly photographed, however, that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the "wet sheet" tie that was used in insane asylums at the time.  This film flopped at the theatres, and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece, ignoring the magic and escapes that made Houdini famous+dvd
Moving+P+The occasion of this concert was momentous, and what better way to celebrate than with Beethoven's magnificent Ninth Symphony and its customized "Ode to Freedom". I grew up on Bernstein's "Young People's Concerts" and have had a special place in my heart for him ever since. It was startling for me to see him looking sickly at this concert. But in spite of his obvious physical discomfort, he threw himself into the music with full passion, sometimes conducting with his whole body - dancing and jumping at times - and pulled off a heroic performance+dvd
Well photographed, beautiful locations+N+But ultimately unsatisfying. The acting is extremely average. The plot is very underplayed; in fact, too underplayed. Even the erotic aspect of the movie loses its charm early on. I dunno. I don't think Anais Nin would've approved of this adoption of her work+dvd
Not what was promised+N+Original Review:  I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised.  After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up.  Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.  I guess what you see isn't always what you get.  I'm sure the actual movie is fine.  I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches.  Maybe I should check that, too!   Follow-up Review:  Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange.  She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved.  As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift!  I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it. +dvd
If this were a book, it would be a "page turner".+P+Once you start, you can't stop watching.    I watched the USA Network version of Touching Evil before I knew the BBC version ever existed.  I enjoyed USA's Touching Evil greatly.  But the BBC version is phenomenal.  I'm hooked.  5 stars+dvd
REAL FEELING, DIFFERENT THAN YOUR AVERAGER FILM+P+Show Me Love is a good film. The story of two teenage girls in high school. Agnes is in love with Elin, who is in the more popular group. I won't give away the plot but the film is not overstated like a lot of films, it goes at a lot more natural pace.Both actress' give a good performance, it doesn't feel like your watching a film, one has moments where it's like ''I've done that'', I have held a yearbook photo and obsessed over it, while playing a song about how I love them.   It's my first swedish film that I have watched and really dig+dvd
Delivery and condition+P+I am very happy with this product the delivery and condition of was very goo+dvd
Francis Ford Coppala's first musical+P+Coppala was right out of college when he was asked to do "Finian's Rainbow". It had been a big hit on Broadway in the 40's but predated the civil rights movement.  Coppala had the task of updating it for 1968.  Fred Astaire is 69 in the title role and this was his last role dancing and singing. This was the first times since the beginning of Astaire's career that he didn't have control over the direction of his musical numbers. Coppala was an inexperienced director and fired Hermes Pan, Fred's chorographer. He admits that it was his fault that  Fred's big number in the film didn't come out the way should.   Petula Clark is wonderful as Astaire's daughter. Tommy Steele who was also in "The Happiest Millionare" and "Half a Sixpence" plays a part typical of his personality.  There is very little chemistry between Petula Clark and her love interest, Dan Franck. PLOT:  Finian(Astaire) is an Irishman that steals a pot of gold from Og (Tommy Steele). He heads toRainbow Valley, which is right next to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he thinks burying the gold will multiply his riches.  He meets some people, Woody and Silent Sue, and gives them money to save their land from the bigot senator (Keenan Wynn).  In return he wants part of their land to secretly bury the gold.  Og follows Finian to get his gold back. He is turning into a mortal because he has lost his pot of gold.  Meanwhile, Finian's daughter(Petula Clark) is falling in love with a local, Woody (Dan Franck).  Nicely restored with great special features. Includes a commentary with Coopala that actually has a mini documentry before it.  Featurette is the world premere with interviews with the stars+dvd
the only thing scary about this is the acting+N+First off, terrible acting. It seems so unreal. It's just like nine four year olds playing hide and go seek. Paris's character Jo gets killed in the first fifteen minutes after getting a bath, which I can only imagine how much she loved flaunting that body of hers. :( The only thing interesting was the hot British and Scottish actor guys! Other than that, lame lame lame!!+dvd
Clear, Clean, Concise+P+If you have a Swiss Ball and you don't have this DVD then you are not getting everything that you can out of your ball. This is an excellent training DVD if you want to maximize your fitness conditioning and increase your functional strength, suppleness, agility and coordination. The 3 training segments are each 20 minutes, not 10 minutes as another reviewer reported. The videography is excellent, clearly and simply showing each movement without any fancy fadeouts or quick switches. Each phase is more challenging. I would say that the phase 1 section can be done by most people of average fitness after a couple of weeks of practice. However at first you may need your remote to pause the DVD until you acquire the skill to transition into and out of some of the more challening postions. Let's face it, if you aren't at an average fitness level then you should be doing a different overal kind of training, not focusing on abs. Personally I am 56 years old and teach Holistic Nature Workouts professionally. I have shared the training methods in this DVD with several people already and they have all benefited tremendously from them and are now including them in their workouts. Have a ball+dvd
not what i thought+N+My father, my friend mandy and i watched this movie last night. we were all very disappointed. we thought the movie wasn't realistic. we watched the news and saw all the firefighters and police officers running into the buildings trying to help the people. in this "movie" we saw them leisurely walking around, even stopping to have nice conversations with each other about what they thought was happening. we were really disappointed with the search scene.  it made the men and women of our country look like quitters because it was getting dark. we were under the impression that they search through the night. at least that's what we saw on the news. guess we were wrong. all together i would have to say i'm glad i borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting my money buying or renting it+dvd
Cyndi Lauper - Live+P+I love Cyndi and this live concert really shows her talent. A great watc+dvd
do not buy this,do not buy this,do not buy this,do not buy this,do not buy this, seriously!!!!!!!!!!!                           +N+i'm sure that many people like this movie.    BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE DIRECTORS CUT VERSION AND SAYS JET LI COLLECTION AT THE BOTTOM, THEN THE DVD DOES NOT PLAY.  I GOT THIS AT CD TRADEPOST FOR 1.99 AND IT SHOWS WHY IT IS PRICED THAT LOW.    THIS MOVIE COMES IN A COLLECTION THAT I DON'T KNOW THE TITLE OF BUT IT COMES WITH A JACKIE MOVIE, AND SHAOLIN IDIOT.  THEY COME IN A NICE LOOKING 5-DISC BOXED SET AND IT LOOKS VERY INTRIGUEING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEM ALL IN DVD CASES LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE.    SHAOLIN IDIOT-LOOK THIS MOVIE UP IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME AND YOU THINK THAT I JUST DON'T LIKE THIS AND AM TELLING YOU NOT TO WATCH IT BECAUSE OF THAT.  LIKE 5 PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN A REVIEW SAYING THE DVD DOESN'T WORK, THAT IS CALLED CONFIRMATION.  AND ONE OF THE REVIEWERS MADE A COMMENT THAT THIS IS NOT SHAOLIN IDIOT BUT ANOTHER STEPHEN CHOW MOVIE THAT SUCKS AND HE MUST HAVE JUST SEEN THIS, THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I CAN THINK OF IS THAT HE HAS THE ONE DVD PLAYER THAT THESE DISCS WORK ON.  I HAVE 7 DVD PLAYERS AND TRIED THIS DVD ON A TOTAL OF 12 DVD PLAYERS, ALL DIFFERENT AND I GOT A DISC ERROR ON ALL OF THEM.  SO OBVIOUSLY THEY JUST DON'T WORK SO JUST DON'T BUY THIS.  THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY WORKS IN THE JET LI COLLECTION FOR 11.99 THAT I REVIEWD ON HERE, AND IT IS THE WORST PICTURE QUALITY I HAVE EVER SEEN FOR A NON OLD SCOOL MOVIE.  THE TRANSLATION SERIOUSLY CANNOT BE READ AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE, AND I COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN BILLY CHOW AND JET LI WERE FIGHTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE PLENTY FO MOVIES THAT COME FROM A HORRIBLE FILM STOCK, BUT THIS COMPETES WITH SOME OF THE ALL-TIME WORST THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.  SO I CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND THIS EITHER.  THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE ONLY  JET LI MOVIE I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT I HAVE TRIED TO FIND.  I HAVE HIS FIRST 3 MOVIES, BUT CAN'T FIND JET LI VS. BILLY CHW PART 2.  SON OF A MOTHER F#&$^%, piece of */@!.    if your eyes are already shot, then you may be able too watch this, but I challenge you to find a worse copy of any movie than what comes in the jet li collection. +dvd
Great Family Show But Poor Transfer Quality & No Extras..+N+Now don't get the wrong impression of my rating because this is an excellent family show and it gets 5 stars it that area, but the 2 rating is my opinion of the poor way that this quality show was put on DVD.. First i noticed that this is a bare bones transfer with no extras but you would think since we are paying good money for these dvds that they would at least make sure the trasnfer quality from film to dvd is excellent, but sadly its not, it seems like there was not much care taken in the transfer process. Let me explain, during the opening music i noticed that it fades in and out something that i did not notice in the previous 3 seasons. Also on a few episodes i just watched, it appears like there was little cleaning up of the film done before transfer to get rid of all the spots or floaters that sometimes appear on older films, it would have been nice if the time was taken to remaster the film for good dvd viewing. It also would have been nice to include a closed caption feature for the hearing impaired for those who need it. In closing i really enjoy watching the Waltons and I am very pleased to have it on DVD, but if a little more care and extra work was put into the transfer process this could be so much better and i would feel i am getting the most for my money spent...+dvd
I'M QUITE DISSAPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE+N+A PRINCESS AND 8 SAMURAIS BATTLE THE HIKIMA CLAN. THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS+dvd
Legend of the 8 reasons not to buy this movie.+N+If you are a real hard core Sonny Chiba Collector, then this is not worth your time, because he doesn't do really anything in this flick! Why is it not in widescreen? Why is there no original language track? This is DVD right? If you still want this movie to fill the gap in your Chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality+dvd
Bleak and despairing....+P+This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a "I know what kind of person you really are" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.  Great film....      +dvd
Jakie Chan At His Best+P+'The Medallion' captures all of the qualities fans of Jakie Chan know and love, action, supspense, extreme humor, and a touch of mystisism, all the qualities I know and loved in the KID'S WB! 'Jakie Chan: Adventures' cartoon series. It has a great cast [Julian Sands as the dreaded Snakehead, Claire Forlani as the high kicking Interpol Agent Nicole, Lee Evens as the bumbling Agent Watson, and, of course, Jakie Chan as the Chinese Super-Man Eddie Yang] that help give the movie a great energy. The greatest thing about it was it wasn't afraid to make fun of itself! Great movie, I hope they make a sequel!+dvd
Rated on the fun factor, but not a GREAT film+P+I had to give this one 4 stars just because it is so fun.  It is deeply flawed at points and as deep as a puddle, yet it is funny and still has some moving moments.  The nostalgia factor works as well if you were out and about at the time.  Affleck comes across a big dope, but that's okay (cuz I think he is).  Ricci is great - why is she so underutilized?  That girl has a power in her.  Rudd is the sweet sort of everyman good guy and it suits him well.  Love is, well, actually ... good here.  I liked her and I felt for her character. Hudson is very, very funny, particularly in her scenes with Jay Mohr - they have great chemistry.  Garoffalo is the best in a tart-tounged smaller part.  Definitely worth a spin for an easy-on-the-eyes comedy.  Best line, Garoffalo in a moving cab trying to light a cigarette: These matches are disappointing me!+dvd
I wanted to cut out my eyes+N+This was a bad movie, the acting was horrible, the dialogue was laughable, and some of the action sequences were ridiculous! Especially that one scene where they blantantly &quot;borrow&quot; scenes from Terminator 2.  It's insane they use scenes straight from the movie, from when they tried to break into Cyberdyne systems. And they didn't even change that name they kept it, Cyberdyne systems. It was a very sad thing to see+dvd
One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen+P+From Here to Eternity, where to begin?  This is probably one of my top 10 movies that I've ever seen.  I love it!  Frank Sinatra is wonderful in it; Montgomery Clift is gorgeous, vulnerable, and brave in this movie; Burt Lancaster is awesome, as everyone who has ever seen him could tell you.  This movie shows a clear depiction of the soldiers at Pearl Harbor before it was bombed.  The book is a totally long, obnoxious book, towards the end I only read the quotations. The movie totally changed the book and made it wonderful.  This is a classic, and will be for the rest of time+dvd
Great movie, horrible DVD!+N+Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film+dvd
cliche ridden ...+N+I like Dennis Hopper and love Frederick Forrest.  Neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with.  They seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines.  Sad to see such great talents wasted in a film filled with gratuitous violence and terrible "pop psychology" dialogue. Was there a point to this film+dvd
pretty good+P+This was predictable, I called most times what was going to happen and it did+dvd
Not the real deal!+N+If you sre looking for the Anime style Little mermaid, The one with the sad ending, please note that this is not it! Now I havent seen this film but I'm sure it's fine lust not the one most people are looking for. The origanal in DVD format has a realy stupid cover but some nice person gave a few captures so I am sure that it's the one you're looking for. The cover is mainly blue with a blond haired mermaide who looks nouthing like Merina playing with some fish. The titel on the top of the page reads 'The Little Mermaid (UAV Corporation) (2000)' and if you look at the extra pics someone put up and reed the revews you'll not make the mistake of buying the wrong film. Hope this helps good luch+dvd
Not bad+P+This season was pretty good with a lot of actions and a great number of issues resolved. Hopefully the fifth season will answer the rest+dvd
Sirens+P+This is one of my favorite movies. It's so seductive and funny and beautiful all at the same time. Now, this is a chick flick. I don't know if most men would agree with me. If you like artsy films, you will probably enjoy this movie.+dvd
Absolutely the WORST WWII oriented movie ever made.+N+I had to type this review to hopefully prevent others from making the mistake of buying or watching this "movie."  To all the intellectually enlighted who gave it positive and glowing reviews, I can only say you must also like Yoko Ono music and abstract art.  This is not a war movie or a social commentary whatsoever, it's garbage.  I read the book years ago and thought the book was kinda' goofy, but the movie's off-the-chart bad.  If you want to watch a kid have sex with ladies, watch people vomit, watch the seemingly constant need to urinate in glorious color just about everywhere every five minutes, and listen to a kid scream a lot for no apparent reason, then get his father killed, also seemingly for no good reason, this is your movie.  Oh, and let's not forget the decapitated horse head filled with eels - man, coulda' lived without that image all day.  Overall, WORST MOVIE EVER MADE DEALING WITH THE THIRD REICH.  If you want an excellent older German anti-war movie which actually makes sense, buy "THE BRIDGE", which I cannot believe has not been remade by a major studio yet. +dvd
A great B-Movie+N+Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc+dvd
A heartwarming movie+P+I really enjoyed this movie because it was funny as well as sad in parts.  Leonardo Dicaprio is by far the best actor I have ever seen+dvd
The Jazz Singer & Neil Diamond ROCK!+P+This review is for my wife, Marilyn, as our wedding song came from it:  I was a senior in high school when this movie first hit the theaters and I loved it then and I love it now.  Yes, the acting is a bit hammy by Laurence Olivier who was attempting to appease the Jewish population after giving an Oscar-nominated performance a year or so before for playing with great relish a vicious Nazi who tortures, via dentist equipment, Dustin Hoffman in "The Marathon Man."  Can anyone forget his famous line from that film, "Is it safe?"   In addition, Lucie Arnez is no great actress, but what she lacks in talent she makes up for in her charming honest portrayal as Diamond's compassionate agent.   Lastly, Neil Diamond is certainly no great actor either, no matter how much I love him as musician and entertainer, but this movie somehow works despite these noted flaws and some rather amateurish direction by Richard Fleicher.  Perhaps the movie succeeds because the plot is as timeless as Hollywood gets.  We all love to experience someone achieving his or her goals and that's why these kinds of movies withstand the test of time even when the critics blast them.  Consider the following:  While Olivier hams it up a bit, he is still great to watch and demands your respect.   Lucie Arnez is disarmingly charming in her role as an agent trying to help someone she believes in, but also trying not to be caught up in her client's personal life.  Of course, Neil Diamond is no actor, but he is pleasing to watch and he's certainly believable in a role that he was destined to play as it mirrors his own story quite a bit; he came from a family of dentists and was expected to be one also, but he dropped out in his last semester and hit the road with a backpack and his guitar --the rest is history.  Lastly, the music is awesome.  Diamond was at the height of his career musically when he did this film and the soundtrack produced 3 #1 songs and was one of Billboard's longest running soundtrack best-sellers.  This was no fluke as Diamond had already won praise for his song "Be" from the film "Jonathan Livingston Seagull."  He knows how to write music for films and I wish he had more opportunities to do so.  While the movie wasn't necessarily "a hit," but it did find a substantial audience and made a good profit.  Something about it made it work even though it is admittedly flawed.  It went on to greater success on VHS and DVD and this new addition will probably sell just as well or better with the improved sound clarity that the other releases seriously lacked.  I was happy to read here that I wasn't the only one turning up the volume for the dialogue and lower it for the music segments.  That drove me nuts in the earlier releases.  Moving along, although I am Christian, I grew up in a mostly Jewish section in Brooklyn, New York, in fact, not far from where Diamond and Streisand actually grew up.  My home was near Diamond's high school.  Anyhow, between that and having dated a wonderful Jewish girl most of my high school days I grew to appreciate the Jewish faith and culture.  My neighborhood local theater re-released this film numerous times and I went to see it each time they played it.  It was the first movie I took my wife to see back in April of 1983 and she loved it and cried at the end as many in the theater did.  The #1 song "Hello Again" went on to become "our song" and the one we danced to at our wedding as your spouse should also be your best friend and that's what the song is about and even the movie as well to some degree as Diamond's wife in the film never shared his interests or desires although she was aware of them since they were little kids growing up in the same neighborhood.  She kept crying how he had changed when he became a pop-rock star when in reality his desires had simply come true.  All she ever attempted to do in the film was either hold him back or ignore his dreams and a spouse should never do either of those.  Having said all this it is obvious that my love for Diamond's music, Hollywoods tireless theme of success against the odds, watching any performance by the great Olivier, and sharing this film with the woman I would eventually spend the next 24 years of my life with make me a bias reviewer here.  I concede that observation, but still contend that in spite of this film's obvious flaws, it is still great entertainment.  Enjoy this classic+dvd
Wow... that was so bad I think I have to die right now!+N+One good thing about this movie is that it helped me find religion.  It was so bad that I actually wrote a prayer:  Oh great and loving God, take mercy upon this, the lowliest of your creatures.  Burn my brain, I beseech thee... yeah with fire, acid, turpentine, and super-hot hot sauce lay waste to the portion of my brain which remembers having viewed "Point Blank" with Mickey Rourke!  Keep me safe and guide my steps far, far from future viewings, so that in thy mercy I might instead feast upon broken glass and burning hot lava, and smear my naked buttox with honey and lay me upon a hill of ants rather than ever see this film again.  Amen.  Like many of you, I first came across this little gem while searching for the 1967 masterpiece of funkadelic nihilism starring Lee Marvin.  Well, of course THAT'S not out of DVD yet, but since I'm a huge fan of Mickey Rourke (for reasons which, as his career progresses, I find more and more difficult to remember), I thought "Wow, Mickey Rourke just re-made one of the coolest movies of all time... might be worth watching."  Boy, was THAT a mistake!  First of all, this IS NOT a remake of Lee Marvin/John Boorman's Point Blank.  That's two strikes against Rourke, because he ALSO starred in "Bullet," a stupid piece of crap which had nothing to do with Steve McQueen's "Bullit," another of the great guy films of all time.  It's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and Mickey Rourke Kills them.  'Nuff said re the plot.  One thing that really sticks out about this film is that Rourke, typically a pretty muscular dude, is positively STEROIDAL!  I mean, he put on SO MUCH muscle for this role that his skin literally looks as if it's going to fissure and peel off!  I don't know what he was on, but it must be something we normally use on farm animals+dvd
How Do You Like What You See?+P+Class Of 1984 has always been marketed as as a B exploitation film.  Hell, I remember when I was a kid finding it in the "horror" section of the local video store!  Though the film does have it's exploitation elements for sure, Class Of 1984 is a damn good movie.  It could have been promoted as a more serious film(it actually was intended to be a more serious drama) and win over more critics, but like they mention in the documentary featurette, the scenes of violence and punk rockers and such were enough to prejudice some people into thinking the movie was something less than what it actually was.  I never saw much of Perry King's work before or after this, but he's a very good choice as a kind of wimpy music teacher who thinks that through the power of knowledge, he can help the troubled teen, Timothy Van Patten.  In fact, King's music class is probably the best behaved of the entire school with Van Patten as the only real rotten apple in the bunch...when he attends.  Pretty boy Van Patten is kind of a teenage Godfather who runs drugs and hookers out of a punk rock club.  His gang consists of three annoying thugs and one very annoying chick.  When King pisses Van Patten off, the war begins.  It starts off pretty simple with vandalism and practical jokes, but ends up being quite deadly.  King goes through the movie in the role of dogooder throughout all of Van Patten's antics.  I think most guys would have broken down long before King's character does, but when King does break down it's well worth the wait.  If you let yourself get into the story, this movie will make your blood boil as you feel the frustration King feels.  Whenever he retaliates, he's the one who gets in trouble, though you know he's really not doing anything wrong.  It's like in real school where a guy would hit you with a spitball and no one would ever see him, but you'd be the one caught when you fired a spitball back.  Plus the frustration mounts coz every rotten act Van Patten commits is brushed off coz "no one saw him do it" and the fact that he's a juvenile.  The film builds to a fantastic final confrontation that gets downright brutal.  Lots of great performances all around.  Van Patten should have gone on to be a bigger star, but it never happened.  He's does a great job as the evil, sly psychopath.  Of course special praise must be given to Roddy McDowell.  He's fantastic in this.  They couldn't have picked a better guy for the job.  Many thanks go out to Anchor Bay for putting this great film out on dvd.  There's a good halfhour documentary on the disc that speaks mainly to director Lester, as well as two of the actors.  Recommended very highly.  Yesiree, Bob+dvd

Huh?+N+Are you kidding me-- the boy in the plastic bubble falls in love with this girl who wanted nothing to do with him until she went skating and hit her head on a nice outdoor patio set that I swear came from Home Depot.  Sure, I should be more concerned about who the stumkopf was who put lawn and garden itmes in the middle of a skating rink, I just wish that the skating chick who do perform a perfect Hamil Camel in front of ten thousand screaming fans could act her way our of a triple sow-cow.  BEsideds, didn't she play a dumb blonde skater in a James Bond movie?  Wow what a stretch!  And couldn't someone on that balcony have screamed "Hey, dummy, watch out for the chiminea!"  Anyway this movie made me wish I was blind!  Skip it and every movie with the tag line-- starring Robbie Benson+dvd
Cheezy Production+N+This is a cheezy production. Looks like someone's home video with a stage set up in their living room. BTW -- Better Sex through Yoga could be a title for any Yoga practice.

Jim West Was My First Martial Arts Instructor+P+As a teenager, I first became interested in the martial arts by watching James West ply his trade in this series.  Although his defensive and offensive moves now look phony and ineffective, 42 years ago they completely captured my attention and imagination.  Initially, I tried my hands and feet at a number of martial arts styles before settling on John McSweeney's version of Kenpo Karate.  (John was one of Ed Parker's first black belts.)  I was the head instructor at his school, Self-Defense Unlimited, in Elmhurst, Illinois, for over 20 years, eventually earning a 7th degree black belt.    As editor of the American Kenpo Karate Association newsletter, I wrote many articles on the martial arts, as well as two books that are sold on Amazon.  And, of course, I learned the value of working out every day and pushing my body to its limits--and beyond.  The bottom line is that Wild Wild West truly had a profound influence on my life.  And as this DVD set shows, it was also one of the most entertaining programs to ever hit the tube+dvd
True Friends-Entertainment !+P+I only bought this DVD because I haven't seen the very first episode... and what can I say? It's true Friends-Entertainment :+dvd
gentle clifford+P+This is a great addition to a Clifford collection, with nothing remotely scary or questionable.  The episodes include  Camping it up Hooray for Cleo Home is Where the Fun Is Lights Out    Which all emphasize enjoying nature, and  Clifford's Charm School Best Paw Forward Clifford's Hiccoughs An Itchy Patch  Which generally emphases manners and being yourself.  All in all, sweet, neutral entertainment for my 3 year old, though older kids would enjoy it too. +dvd
Better than staring at a wall...+N+One mindblowing, boring saturday night I decided to watch I Know What You Did Last Summer. Oh what a choice. So I sat there and watched and watched. The first maybe 25 minutes seemed quite entertaining. But as the plot began to unravel, it seemed more clear to me that it was just like any other Scary teen movie. Yes, some parts of it were suspensful. But the movie was very pointless. Some guy chasing after some rich ass teens after they killed a guy that wasn't even related to him? And what was up with the whole costume? It was very stupid and predictable. Bassicaly this movie is good if you have nothing else to do, than waste one hour and a half of your life.+dvd
Good melodrama, fine leading performance, handsome production+P+For all the care they put into this fine, textured story of a pedophilia scandal in a Catholic orphanage in 1970s Newfoundland, the filmmakers can't let go of the conventional dichotomy of child abuse dramas: grim, teeth-gnashing villains and righteous, just-folks heroes.  It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama.  Henry Czerny, though, gives  a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part.  And the Canadians go further than American filmmakers ever could or would, suggesting how available the boys' bodies are, and what could be attractive about them.  Finally, the whole snowbound, wood-paneled production is goregous to look at.  Subject matter aside, if you doubt that Canada is a distinct place from the United States, take in the sights, sounds, and attitudes of this small epic+dvd
WHAT A MOVIE+N+one of the most powerful and disturbing movies i have ever seen.  thank god for the canadians.  i doubt this could have been made in america.  but it was disturbing.  i grew to literally hate some of the people in thia movie and had to shake off what i felt when they found it was time to pay the piper.  this should be required watching for all straight people.  maybe then they would figure out that pediphiles are not gay.  there is a vast difference between gay males and pedophiles.  anyway, i can not recommend this movie strongly enough.  the acting and the group of people  who directed and produced this movie were very brave in doing so.  this is a taboo subject in the u.s.  once again, thanks to the canadians and the european's who DO make this type of movie.   gary in az+dvd
Just plain horrible+N+I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good.  This was not one of them.  Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley).  The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look".  If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity+dvd
He named his dog after Ronald Reagan. +P+This was one of those mythological films that I speak so highly of in other reviews. This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was.   Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles.  Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human.  When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production.  One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end.  This film did nothing close to that.  What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions.  Not much was handed to you on a silver platter.    Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story.  It is a crime/thriller/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time.  There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching.  The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988.  The cinematography was outstanding.  There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind.  After Berenger tries to "put down" his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind.  It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent.  There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well.   Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws.  The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad.  Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple.   Betrayed ends like an open-ended question.  It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated.  It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film.  Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist.  But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever.  The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy? Dark and impressive ... WOW, I am lucky to have found this one.   Grade:  ***** out of ****+dvd
the creek definitely took a nosedive in its college years, but...+N+i hadn't seen all of these episodes when they aired--nor all of seasons 4 or 5, as my interest/obsession waned after the crew went to college--so it was worth it to me to be able to view them all in full.  HOWEVER, they aren't very good and i very much doubt that i will watch them again and again over time the way i might the first 3 seasons.  the final two-part episode is an exception but if one wanted, one COULD buy that episode alone on DVD.   the creators took the helm back for the series finale and it focuses on our original 4-5 characters (5 if you include jack), leaving out audrey and others, which i for one VERY MUCH appreciated.  although to me they already had enough of an acceptable reason and to reunite everyone in capeside (five years in the future) and enough material w/which to surprise us (and tie up some loose ends) all in a nice melodramatic/comedic fashion WITHOUT *killing another character off*. (after both abbey and mitch met accidental deaths in earlier seasons, i feel like it gets to be a bit much--but at least this time, there's a believable--although rarely occurring--medical cause.)  at least joey ended up with the right guy (in my not-so-humble opinion).  basically, if you're a committed dawson's (err, joey's ;-) creek fan and want to collect the whole set, you'll want to purchase this season.  otherwise, though, you might consider skipping it and maybe buying the series finale separately.  also, special features were sorely lacking.  this set marked the end of one of the WB's most successful shows that launched acting careers for several young people; the least they could have done is include behind-the-scenes interviews with cast/crew!  creator commentary on the last episode just doesn't cut it+dvd
Bizarre and ridiculous rip-off; a drug-induced nightmare put to film+N+How the film-makers achieved financing to make this film I'll never understand.  The make-up, costuming, screen-writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing are all over-the-top and way over-done.  It looks like an amateur film-school project.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful--the one bright spot in this film.  For some reason, a film set in the late 19th century had the male lead and entire cast break out singing "The Sound of Music" by Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Someone must have been smoking something illegal that lead to this manic, ridiculous parody? of a musical.  Nowhere did I read a review that said it was a parody and farce; it was supposed to be a musical.  There was no way I could view this film for more than 15 minutes, and that long just to see if the title character would awake from a drug-induced nightmare. I love musicals but this one should definitely be viewed free on television and not rented or bought until you see if you can stand it. Save your money--it is awful.  Note:  If I had read a review such as this, I would have saved myself time and money+dvd
Inside the Mind of the Crooked Politician+P+This is an unusual movie, where the hero is also the villain. I wish modern people would see this movie just to understand the difference between the public perception of a powerful politician and the way he behaves in private. Politics is a dirty game that muddies anyone who plays to win. It is a movie about how power corrupts everyone touched even indirectly by that power. +dvd
Love Metal Archives+P+We love this archive!  We love the band and this is the best collection of their work ever!! +dvd
If you're a fan get the Aussie edition!!!!+P+I love this movie and I can't really add anything else to the reviews already posted. But I will say if you love this movie get the Region 4 version from Australia. Yes you will need a region-free DVD player but it is well worth it. I found one for $35 that I can honestly say is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I can watch any movie I want without the powers that be telling me what I can and cannnot watch based on my geography. The previous poster is incorrect. There are scenes that have chopped. Part of one can be seen in the trailer. Nothing was taken out that will muddy the plot. But I have to ask Miramax, why, at a short 90 minutes, would you bother taking out more of the fun? And I truly have a dislike for the voiceovers done to change Aussie references to American. Don't underestimate the viewing audience Miramax! If we are going to watch this movie, most of us will look up any words or phrases we aren't familiar with. Thats part of the fun.   There are 2 versions of this film available in Oz. There's the standard version and The Pool Room Edition. It comes complete with a fuzzy slipcover to imitate a pool table, a lovely keep case with pictures of the cast, sheet music to "We're Goin' To Bonnydoon", and a top 10 list of the Kerrigans best deals from the trading post. Ahhhh, the serenity+dvd
High Energy Creativity+P+Jamie Oliver is a highly creative cook who inspires cooks everywhere and even inspires people who have never cooked before. To say he is entertaining would be an understatement. I have yet to see anything like the Jamie Oliver Tour. He includes just about every element of entertainment possible in one show. It is a game show, cooking class, cooking competition, music gig, sports event, comedy show, talk show (he almost interviews some of the audience members), magic show and sing along. Basically this is Jamie Oliver's mind on cooking and he is in constant motion, meeting every challenge and even batting oranges into the audience to select people to join him on stage.   The recipes are simple to make and after watching this show you might find yourself trying out something new, and not even measuring anything. I tried his idea with the foil bag to cook fish and it was one of the best dinners I've ever made. The ideas transcend recipes and enter the arena of creative exploration. You can cook with what you have in the kitchen. Don't have leeks? Try onions and potatoes. Want to learn to make your own pasta? Is it really as simple as eggs and flour? Watching Jamie Oliver maker pasta is like watching an artist create. Where he excels is in how he transfers his knowledge to the audience members and they to learn to make pasta, right on stage and he turns it into a competition.   While fast paced and wildly funny, there are a few casual moments to relax. Jamie challenges himself to make Pizza before the Pizza guy arrives. He orders pizza and then tosses flour on the counter and begins to make pizza dough from scratch. His ideas about sun dried tomatoes and fresh mozzarella will make you wish you'd been to the store for the ingredients. In fact, you might want to stock up on ingredients and cook along with Jamie. He really helps to make life less ordinary and more extraordinary.   The new apartment is the entire stage and the set is filled with surprises to entertain. You will start to wish you had a kitchen computer. Jamie leaves the set now and then and there is a screen showing a night out on the town, what it is like to cook in a restaurant kitchen and his wife checks in with him to find out what he is making for dinner. He even makes a cheesecake and then delivers it for a birthday party.   By watching Jamie cook, you can learn basic techniques, time saving tricks and creative uses for herbs and spices. Everything he has taught me to make through his shows and this DVD has turned out to be absolutely delicious and I love the fact that a lot of the things I learn don't require me to measure ingredients.   ~TheRebeccaReview.com +dvd
Masterpiece+P+I am continually amazed at the huge variation in people's tastes. Someone can give a 1 star rating and the next a 5 star rating for the same film. I can be touched by a film so deeply and yet the person sitting next to me feels nothing. I guess it proves how different we all are. &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; touched me. I would rank it amongst the best 5 films I have ever seen. The film is mysteriuos, haunting, slow paced, impecably filmed and acted. So many images remain in my mind. The woman who breaks down and has to be pacified by a tranquilizer, the haunting music associated with the witch that permeates throughout the movie, the long take as the house is burned etc etc. This is a truly great masterpiece. What a shame Tarkovsky died so young+dvd
Your kids will probably be bored+N+I realize that this batch of films is aimed at older teenagers and college kids, not adults over the age of 25. However, you can probably do much better picking out films your kids will watch than this collection. That's not to say that there aren't some great yet silly films in the batch, because there are. Next I describe each film in descending order of quality.  UHF (1989) - This is a great film starring Weird Al Yankovic as a directionless young man whose uncle gives him a rundown TV station to manage. His unconventional programming turns things around for himself and the station.   Cooley High (1975) - This is a great film for all ages, and was the basis for the sitcom "What's Happening", although it only faintly resembles it. It is set in south-side Chicago in the mid 60's, and concerns a group of high school friends that have numerous comic encounters, but there is also some tragedy involved in the plot.  Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) - The first one was very funny and fresh, and Keanu Reeves will always be Ted as far as I'm concerned, even if he winds up doing Shakespeare at some point. The plot concerns two slackers who are about to fail history that are given some help from a time traveller from the future. The only problem is that it is so steeped in 80's pop culture that your kids may not get half the jokes.  Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) - The second one is still funny, it just seems to try harder and not get quite the same comic effect as the first.   The rest of the movies are under the National Lampoon label.  Dorm Daze (2003) - One of National Lampoon's better college farce movies, with the plot set up by a series of silly misunderstandings. The closest thing you're going to get to "Animal House" 25 years after the fact.  Going the Distance (2004) - A Canadian version of Roadtrip. This movie was better than I expected, with a lot of good interaction between the main characters, but still not that great even for a teen farce.  Class Reunion (1982) - This movie had all the ingredients to be funny, but it just bored me, even in 1982. Top that off with all of the 80's and even 70's pop culture references, and I don't think it would do much for today's kids.  The last three movies are just awful - "Movie Madness", "Gold Diggers", and "Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj". I won't even bother to describe them. When I say they're bad, I'm saying they are boring and completely unfunny. If you force your kids to sit through these three films as part of their summer break, they'll be looking forward to going back to school.  The end result is you have three good to excellent films that are all older movies, four mediocre to OK films, and three horrible movies. I think you can do much better at entertaining your older teenagers/college kids than this collection+dvd
Funny, but not sure how "ironic" she really is+P+Miss Silverman is the most recent addition to the group of "meta-bigot" comedians -- i.e. comics who tell ethnic jokes supposedly for their "shock" value, while hiding behind a screen of supposed irony -- which includes Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, Chris Rock, and the writers of South Park. I find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the "n" word so much. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive, female and Jewish. If Larry the Cable guy ever said the "n" word on a comedy DVD, I guarantee you that Al Sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick.   Keep in mind that Silverman has been dating Jimmy Kimmel of "The Man Show" fame for many years. Though I am a female, I did truly enjoy The Man Show, though I thought it wasn't as ironic as many people would have you believe. Anti-PC "irony" is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves, and don't have the gonads to do so in public. Anyone who can appreciate humor knows there's a difference between comedy and hate, but many are so sensitive that they can't tell the difference.+dvd
My little nit to pick...+P+I think there's already enough reviews on this complaining about the lack of DVD features, the quality, and the awfulness of the movie (that's the POINT, people!!!). But I LOVED IT! It was hilarious! Except...my roommate and I were disappointed that there was no making out at the end...only the beginning, which was COMPLETELY irrelevent to the rest of the movie+dvd
HOLY WOMEN WALK WITH DEVILS+N+Well, it's Hell on Earth for all of us mere mortals as Aion with a bewitched Rosette wanders the world healing people and driving mankind into enforcing justice, even if they have to murder those they find guilty of sin! The Magdalene Order is strangely relegated to the sidelines in the old "God doesn't interfere with Man, so He lets the Devil do it!" cliche. The whole thing becomes some sado-masochistic dream in which characters are dying left and right but don't worry, we're being tested like Job fatalism. Chrono and Azmaria desperately try to track down Rosette as Satella is locked in a battle with her older sister, whose memory was wiped by Aion.   Sad to say but Volume 7 of Chrono Crusade brings a series that started with a lot of laughter and entertainment to an end filled with sadness and overacting drama. Maybe to a Japanese audience this theme of making Man to suffer as a test is something new, but to Christians, it's all old hat. The humor from the first couple of Volumes is also sorely missed with this gloom and doom installment. And another sore point is Azmaria's singing which is supposed to be divine, but just sounds like poorly pronounced English by a Japanese singer. The saddest facet of this show is that it never was allowed to achieve its potential.+dvd
Bad Language+N+I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG+dvd
Appalling+N+I waited to receive this copy from the US,and when I checked it out it was very bad quality.Thick of the worst video you have,and I think you can understand.I certainly won't be buying anything off this studio again.I do recommend dvds from Red Sun,Hong Kong Legends and Vengeance Video are ok. The film is a masterpiece of classic kung fu,but the quality is dire.I hope Red Sun release it+dvd
Could have been a great movie+N+I waited in angst to see this movie when it came out on HBO. I love the Rat Pack and couldn't wait to hear the music. I thought the cast was excellent. The problem was the music for Sinatra, wasn't Sinatra singing.   The result obviously for a fan is pure dissapointment to say the least. Maybe people who don't realize this will like the film and rate it 5 stars. Like I said... could have been a great movie, it just wasn't.   You can't blame the actors. Who are great! Who wouldn't want to have played these parts+dvd
Head of it's class!+P+One of the best of the head-in-a-box genre (see also "The Head" (1959) Victor Trivas, dir; "The Frozen Dead" (1966) starring Dana Andrews) this particular movie is enlivened by the relentless saxophone score and the notion of a man out shopping for bodies for his decapitated fiancee at strip clubs. Hey! Might as well have the best!  The story is straightforward and stupid: a car crash decapitates the fiancee, so of course the only rational response to this predicament is to keep her head alive in a box in the basement. Why couldn't he keep her body alive, too, then just stitch them back together? Well, the scientist boyfriend must have lost his head because he didn't think about this course of action. Or many he was thinking with his little head and seized the opportunity to create a more bodilicious girlfriend with some cut and paste action! Anyway, the girlfriend gets jealous...watch out for a woman scorned! "No baby, it's not like that. I was at the strip club looking for new bodies for you!" Yeah right try that out around MY house and see what happens. Anyway, the plan goes awry and the nasty humanoid critter gets out of the closet (Ohhh I'm in a cold sweat over that one) and the movie finally ends. And not with the expected bang, either. Fabulous hideous terrible schlock. Highly recommended!+dvd
this is so bad and so low+N+i just failed to finish it. i rejected it from my dvd player after tormented by this horrible taste movie about 30 minutes. it's not just ridiculous or not funny, it's stupid.+dvd
Pretty woman meets Leon.+P+I thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting, with a budget probably no bigger than an average Jackie Chan movie. The ending was novel and Jet Li&#8217;s use of needles, to supplement his martial arts skills, added a fresh touch.  Jet Li looks convincing, with respect to his characterisation. And Bridget Fonda looks good too.+dvd
NOT JUST BAD BAD FOR YOU! So Sugary sweet it makes you sick to your stomach. +N+On the surface Maid In Manhattan it seems like a light romantic comedy with a predictable and sweet love story. However the numerous racist and sexist stereotypes throughout the undertones of this Cinderella tale will make any viewer of color extremely bitter. Better have a couple of barf bags around while watching this movie. You're gonna need them.  Jennifer Lopez is a maid in a four-star downtown Manhattan hotel. (Stereotype #1 about Latinas) She dreams of becoming a hotel manager (Stereotype #2 about Latinas- all work in service jobs). A single mother (Stereotype #3) she struggles to work during the day and take care of her 10-year-old son and is supported by her mother (Stereotype#4) who works in a rundown Spanish restaurant uptown (Stereotype#5) While cleaning the room of a rich British woman, she decides to try on some of her clothes. Conveniently, a rich senate candidate comes to the room and mistakes her for the Hotel guest. He's smitten by her charm and her looks. She's attracted to his loot. So to bag the rich guy she and her friends (also minority stereotypes) go along with the ruse and more supposedly humorous hijinks ensue. The flimsy story disappears and the movie slowly changes from a vehichle for Jennifer Lopez, Actress into a vanity project for J. Lo, Superstar. We get numerous shots of her walking around the city in designer clothes, Eating at fancy restaurants and trying too hard to look hot while courting a bored Senate candidate. The movie comes to a climax when the ruse is revealed. She and her friends at the hotel are fired and her dreams of becoming a Hotel Manager are crushed.  But wait-Prince Charming(tm) is riding down in his white limo to save her. He's had such a wonderful time with her that he's fallen in love(tm). He tries to talk to her in the street, but she gives him some spiel about not knowing who she was when she was a maid and now caring about her. This leads to him seeking her out at her new job. While she's working at another hotel, where he's conveniently he's holding a press conference, he finds her and professes undying love for her. They kiss and we get a montage of pictures showing them living happily ever set to J.Lo's painful butchering of Diana Ross' classic "I'm Coming out." She's married to the senator, getting the management job at the hotel and then one of her saying they're still married a year later. Excuse me I have to go puke. (I also have to reorder the barf bags; no telling when I'm going to need them for the next romantic comedy)  Words can't describe how much I hate this movie. It's an insult to women and minorities. Maid in Manhattan insidiously hides numerous racist and sexist messages under a beautiful front of pretty actors, lavish locations and luxury goods. The movie secretly tells women of color they can't find success without those essentials for success: expensive designer clothes, perfect make-up, beautiful hair and a rich White man to save them. Worse, it tells women to lie and manipulate to get what they want. Because we all know working hard takes way too much time from shopping. Movies like this aren't bad; they're bad for you. Watch too many movies like these and you'll get your mind warped.  It seems like the producers were trying to make a "Pretty Woman" type movie for J.Lo but they didn't understand the execution of J.F. Lawton's brilliant concept. In an attempt to copy Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan tries to update the fairy tale by just using minority characters in most of the roles and fails miserably. There was a lot more under the surface of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts vehichle than most people understand. Pretty Woman wasn't an update of a fairytale it was a satire poking fun at the fairy tale. Lawton was making fun of all the fairy tale stereotypes by using L.A's downtrodden as the characters in the story. He was making the comment that to get to happily ever after both the man and the woman have to learn to value each other as equals.  The acting here is horrible. No, scratch that it's WRETCHED. Jennifer Lopez is terrible. Terrible singing, terrible acting and she didn't look too hot in all those designer clothes either. She has no chemistry with Ralph Finnes and adds no dimension whatsoever to her character. Throughout the movie she's just J.Lo superstar playing dress up. After seeing this movie and Enough I can tell you Jennifer Lopez's acting career is in serious trouble. She's gone from an actress who showed tremendous potential Selena, Out of Sight, and Anaconda to an egotistical over-the-top ham with no presence and no personality. Ralph Finnes is horribly miscast in the role of the Senate candidate. I couldn't believe he was from New York with that British accent that kept popping up in every scene. An actor of his caliber deserves better than this syrupy slop. Bob Hoskins must need some rent money because a fine actor like him deserves better than this. Natasha Richardson and Amy Sedaris chew on scenery while waiting for their paychecks to clear. Tyler Posey (Parker Posey's son) is the only actor to give a good performance here. I'd love to see more of him in the future.  Please, Please IF YOU VALUE YOUR DAUGHTER'S SELF-ESTEEM DO NOT LET THEM WATCH THIS MOVIE! Get them the Wonderful Bend it Like Beckham, Akeelah and The Bee, and Disney's Mulan. The older crowds can Get Muriel's Wedding, J.F. Lawton's Pretty Woman or his hilarious Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.+dvd
a disappointment!+N+I must agree with a few others on here that I was disappointed with this version of 'Peter Pan'.   PROS: -Cathy Rigby's skill as an olympic gymnast really gave Peter a great element of athleticism. Great voice and fun actress. -Scenic design and set design all really nicely done, a bit predictable, but predictable is what an audience wants to see when they to to a production of 'Peter Pan'  CONS: -The cuts! Like others have said, this production is totally rushed and they made some weird cuts. -The face value acting doesn't go deep enough into the characters. While all these performers are skilled individuals, I was not impressed with their acting. However, this could be partially the fault of the director as well. -The lip synching was a huuuuuuge disappointment! -I don't understand what the deal is with the adults playing lost boys. Yes, adult performers can often perform more sophisticated choreography, but a certain nostalgia and innocence is brought to the production when actual kids are invovled.  With all that said, I think that kids would love this video. However, as a musical theatre student there are several shortcomings to this production overall. Nice musical, so-so interpretation. :+dvd
MY TOKEN TO SEE THE SHOW WITHOUT GOING TO SEE IT!+P+Unfortunately, Cathy Rigby is retiring from Peter Pan next year and my mom says I can't go see it at Madison Square Garden. I've never seen the show with Cathy in it, but I've seen Mary Martin's version on TV many times and I know that Rigby was totally awesome. Fortunately, my mom says I am allowed to get the DVD and even at 17, I'll still watch it! I hope I can enjoy the DVD without seeing Cathy Rigby perform live at MSG. (sniffle...) I also hope that many people can look at Cathy Rigby's performance and know that with this DVD, she's doing the show forever+dvd
Do 15 minutes make a movie great?+N+The answer is a big NO!  After the first 15 minutes of this movie, which don't get me wrong were quite awesome, the movie completely tanks at all levels. The movie was set in a mall, but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival, NO! I read an interview with the Director of this movie, and when asked about setting the movie in a mall, the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine.  Now look, when you're using the title, "Dawn of the Dead", you better remake it great, I mean really great.  The followers of Romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the GP.  You know, I might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different.  Definately not when the same.  If you want to see really good Zombie movies, watch the original Romero trilogy, 28 Days Later, the Lucio Fulci trilogy, or even the Return of the Living Dead.  Heck, even the Resident Evil movies easily out did this stinker.  Don't waste your time or money+dvd
Not heavenly but definetly a dog !!!+N+Joe Camp should hang his head in shame for making this piece of trash. I assumed it would be good because he has made good clean family films before. This ain't one of them. This film has indecency in it and is not fit for family viewing. Don't waste your time or money+dvd
Not for young children!+N+I absolutely could not believe this cartoon.  Can you imagine a superhero using swear words? Well, that's what you have with this one.  still can't believe it.  What on earth are they trying to do with Spiderman?  This obviously is a series for adults because, quite frankly, superheroes are supposed to be out for justice, truth and the american way, not to spend time in the gutter learning all the trash they can to spread it wherever. I don't recommend this product at all.  Ours is going into the trash+dvd
A bit formulaic, but excellent for Shakespeare classes+P+Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ is the real star of the comedy _Renaissance Man_.  Many films have featured groups of social misfits who have grown and changed through the assistance of a caring teacher, but in how many of those films has the teacher been dead for almost 400 years?  Danny Devito is funny in this family-friendly film, but it is the Bard himself who shines best here.   I use this film in my college-level Shakespeare courses and find that it is more useful for teaching Shakespeare to young adults than most of the recent film adaptations aimed at the younger generation (_She's the Man_ and _10 Things I Hate About You_ come to mind).  _Renaissance Man_ celebrates the magic of Shakespeare that even recent films preserving Shakespeare's language, such as the _Hamlet_ starring Ethan Hawke, do not.  In _Renaissance Man_, Shakespeare's beautiful language is not replaced.  Rather, it is read and then internalized by the characters who produce their own modernized version in the form of a rap song and chant.  The film teaches about some of Shakespeare's rhetorical strategies (e.g., metaphor, oxymoron) as well as his themes (e.g., mutability).  While the recitation of Henry the Fifth's famous "Crispin Day" speech at the end of the film is a little sappy, the characters' reaction to and obvious enjoyment of the _Henry V_ stage production is not.  The characters in _Renaissance Man_ model for the young people of today how Shakespeare should be experienced.   +dvd
Fun, effective workout+P+After dealing with back pain and general weakness for months, I finally decided to get proactive about the problem and start doing a daily workout. I'd tried this DVD once before, but had no idea of the incredible effect it can have in a very short amount of time. After starting to use it daily just a few weeks ago, I already feel much more limber and energetic all day. My aching back has disappeared, my arms and legs are significantly stronger, and I feel more clear-headed and lucid all day. I can personally attest that the claims on the back of the case, that it will "give your body an active workout and help you develop inner peace and outer strength" are entirely true.  I highly recommend this program. Be aware that it's pretty strenuous, and I often find myself sweating heavily by the end, but if you do it every day, and really put some effort into it, you'll feel and look better very quickly+dvd
Fanciful Rubbish.+N+This film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes. It is as scientifically realistic as the Roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a Geico commercial.   Out of the hundreds of films that I have watched in my lifetime, of every stripe and quality, this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that I began fast-forwarding through simply so that I could see the meteor hit and make the big wave. If this film were a sexual encounter, both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay.  Life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film.+dvd
Scooby-DUD!+N+Loud, obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon.   After watching this film I realized that the legendary 80's mega-flop "Howard the Duck" was almost twenty years ahead of its time. There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered "sequel worthy". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.  If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you! Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of the Scooby-Doo character, but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back!  The sequel deserves the exact same review.  -J+dvd
No information, no pictures+N+The film shows no action, except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body, and you ask yourself, in what relation to the subject of the film this stands. (Sorry, forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man) Just the head of 17-year-old lads, who wonder why they got infected, when they work as prostitute,  explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in Prag. (Like advertising) You are provided with not the least background information about their education, why they left their home town, why they have no normal job. I would wonder what politics think and do  about the youth in the new EC-country, what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school, and what other chances they have in life+dvd
0 STARS:  Los Feces+N+Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie.  Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse.  The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks!  Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!!  Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind.+dvd
Vampires: Los Suckos+N+This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile+dvd
Japanese cinema at its very best+P+With the slew of well known asian films from the likes of Kurosawa, Tsui Hark, ect. it is easy to overlook these precious gems known as the Zatoichi series.  Truly incredible, Shintaro Katsu owns this role and plays the part so damned well you'd swear he must have walked around every day of his life carrying a cane sword and pretending to be blind.  The swordplay scenes are some of the greatest I have ever witnessed and I've seen it all.  They are so realistic and provide a nice counterpoint to the frantic flying wirework approach of the chinese.  If you are a fan of Japanese cinema you owe it to yourself to see these films.  I guarantee you will be utterly captivated from start to finish+dvd
Fabulous Whitney+P+Great to own one of Whitney's All Time Greats DVD. The live performance of "Lover For Life" is great. The Item Arrived within a week which was excellent especially as I'm in UK and ordered from US. This is " A must have" for all you Whitney Funs+dvd
ok, i'll admit it -- it WAS fun watching charlton heston drown ...+N+the least of the big 3 of disaster movies (the others being "poseidon adventure" and "towering inferno") that hit across movie screens in the mid 1970s.  the sensurround gimmick obviously doesnt work when seen on tv, the screenplay and acting are pedestrian, and the special effects now look a cut above flash gordon serials.+dvd
Surprising old movies+N+Dissappointed in this movie, rated PG with profanity in it.  I had to throw it away+dvd
'Allo Allo' season 6+P+Once again Rene Artois succeeds in making occupied France a hotbed of comedy. This set has 8 exceptional episodes mainly involving how to get the English airmen out of France. LeClerc has been replaced with his brother in this season but all the regulars are here. Each season seems to get better and better. Can't wait for seasons 7-9+dvd
LAVA IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING+N+Yep, that's right...a volcanic eruption in NYC is the premise for this hokey but mildly diverting disaster flick.  Seems like nasty doctor Michael Ironside is trying to develop a source of geothermal energy and doing so he starts a volcanic rift under the Big Apple.  Dedicated tunnel worker Costas Mandylor is the first to discover the lava flow but of course no one believes him.  Enter Alexandra Paul as his geologist ex-wife who is called in to find out what's going on.  The FBI is certain it's the work of terrorists, while a high city official is secretly funding Ironside's experiment. The movie is nowhere as intense as the earlier VOLCANO, as it's pending doom never seems large scale enough for a good disaster movie, and the effects aren't that impressive. Diverting entertainment for fans of the genre+dvd
wonderful movie+P+treasure plnet is the best movie ever. I wanted to watch over & over again! it is the a wonderful story. I think it needs to have 10 stars! It's about a boy who go's hunting for treasure, but on his journey he learns something more important. This movie is great+dvd
She will Cream You!+P+In hindsight I should havt to watched this before Foxey Brown, as this was a better movie. However, it seems that Foxey was more memorable, with it's over the top violence. This one's is pretty violent. And Pam Grier is more naked in "Coffy" than "Foxey Brown". Coffy offing a drug pusher in the first few minutes, having a touching family moments, fighting a room full of women that results in everyone's top being janked off, some bad guys nuts getting blown off. Pam traded blows with at least 2 lesbians at once.+dvd
Very good thriller that follows the Spanish tradition+P+While I was watching this movie there was one thing I could not get out of my head: it looks as if the script had been written by Arturo Perez-Reverte. This in itself means considerable praise for the director and screenplay writer Mateo Gil, who adapted a novel by Juan Bonilla, since Perez-Reverte is one of my favorite authors. Before discussing other aspects of the film, I must say that I did not notice any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers regarding the quality of the DVD. I am not an expert in technology, so the reason for this may be that my DVD player adapts better than others to different formats, but I really do not know.  Simon Cardenas, played by Eduardo Noriega is a writer suffering from writer's block, who in the meantime works creating crosswords for a newspaper in Seville. At the start of the last Holy Week of the millennium he gets a strange message on his answering machine. The caller requests that he uses a particular word in a set place in the next crossword puzzle or there will be consequences for Simon's friends and family. The word in question is "Adversario", and Simon decides to play along; but this leads to a series of attacks starting with the release of Sarin, a poisonous gas, inside a church.   Simon decides to start investigating and searching for the source of the attacks, and that is how he meets Maria, the journalist that is in charge of the investigation for the newspaper. From then on, things get really interesting, when more attacks are noticed, and Simon and Maria get involved in the action. Also, Simon's roommate (Toad) starts acting weird and has some suspicious items in his possession, leading to a certain level of paranoia in Simon. Whether this is justified or not, only time can tell.  An interesting script and reasonably good performances make this an enjoyable movie. If you like to discover new places, the impeccable sights of the city of Seville will give the movie and added flare. For those of you that are used to American thrillers, this film may provide a break from the norm. If you have read authors like Perez-Reverte, you know what I mean, since in the Spanish tradition, you do not always find the extremely twisted plots or the consistent happy endings you see in American films. Whether you will get these elements in this movie or not is for you to find out.+dvd
YOU CAN SEE THE JOKES COMING A MILE AWAY  ZZZzzzzzzzzZZzzzzz!+N+My friend felt I needed to see this film, so he lent it to me. I had never seen it before and after 15 minutes I was telling my wife who was watching with me, what was about to happen next. The jokes are so old and tired I couldn't believe they were using them! I would rather watch the Three Stooges(Not that there is anything wrong with that!)At least the Stooges are really old classic shorts that were making history. The comparison to the Stooges is that the jokes in this movies are as old as the jokes in the Stooges shorts. This movie just isn't very good and isn't very funny unless you think a person slipping on a banana peel or a pie in the face is funny?...HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW!!! +dvd
Hard to Watch+N+The first 30 minutes of this movie are great.  Rick is cute and funny as his character is locked out of his dressing room and mobbed by adoring fans.  The concert scenes are TERRIFIC and having seen Rick in concert many times I enjoyed them very much.  Unfortunately, after the requisite "beefcake shot" of Rick, the plot of the movie slides downhill into Bad Soap Opera Land.    Rick CAN act and I have seen him give some amazing performances.  That said, this movie doesn't show his skills in the best light.  Mostly because the writing is HORRID but also because his co-star (Janet Eiber) is not much of an actress.  Rick does his best, but he's left hanging by a bad script and a lame director.    Now, if you're looking for some great Rick Springfield tunes, then this movie won't disappoint you in that respect.  The soundtrack should have won a Grammy.  There are fantastic songs from Rick (one of my personal favorites "Stand Up" is fun and energetic and the hit "Love Somebody" is terrific concert footage), and other very good artists contribute including Peter Gabriel.     My advice is skip the DVD and buy the soundtrack on CD.  A much better investment+dvd
Thunderball Strikes Big!+P+SPECTRE is back, and 007 has got'em.  This time SPECTRE plots to steal two atomic bombs and hold the world for ransom (a situation still very real for the world today).  A bit underrated by some James Bond movie fans, but I think it just gets better with age.  Sean Connery's personal favorite!  Still has the right stuff as James Bond.  Has by far the best looking bevy of Bond girls ever to grace the silver screen!  Claudine Auger, is my Bond Dream Girl as good-girl Domino.  Lucianna Paluzzi, lusciously evil as the first true Bond femme-fatale!  Adolpho Celi, a scary and most formidable opponent. Awesome production values, classic witicisms ("I think he got the point"), spectacular underwater action, and another classic John Barry score make this Bond effort a total splash! ****1/2 out of *****+dvd
The Very Best+P+WARNING- Anybody whom Carol Burnett does not reduce to rolling giggles in "Lovely" had better get terms from the nearest undertaker+dvd
NEGATIVE...+N+Negative...  The 1st season of The Batman was ok, but the second season ruled...third season is mediocre so far.  I want the second season.  The only worthwhile episode on this disc is "The Big Chill".  The other 2 are lack luster.  The Big Chill had a lot of stale "Freeze" jokes, but was well presented.  A 2 out of 5 stars+dvd
ARE YOU KIDDING?+N+People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house.+dvd
The nadir of Corman's shining collection +N+Peter Lorre's ,"The Black Cat",is charmingly done.Yet,the other two are stinkers.I'm a Corman fan,but this was boring and silly to watch.I think they had a good idea ,bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.But,this version and interpretation of Poe's masterpieces didn't translate well at all.So ,beware of the dog+dvd
Classic WHO at its Very Best +P+Revelation of the Daleks is a two part episode from 1985 that features Colin Baker as the Doctor.  The story begins with the Doctor and Peri arriving on Necros, mourning the death of an old friend. Little do the time travellers know that word of their friend's demise is a clever ruse to lure the Doctor into an encounter with some very old enemies.  For on Necros, everything is run by the Great Healer, who is making a fortune with his galactic funeral parlor and some rather sinister side business ventures. Clive Swift of Keeping up Appearances fame (known to fans of that british comedy  as Richard Bucket) appears as Mr Jobel, Caretaker of the funeral parlor, Tranquil Rose, who naturally takes a more than passing interest in young Peri.  But it is the Doctor who gets into the main action when a business partner of the Healer plots against him by hiring a well known assassin of the Grand Order to do  him in. The Doctor quickly learns the Healer is in reality his long running nemesis, Davros. Davros is using the bodies of the dead to further his new race of Daleks loyal to him alone.  But more than one betrayal awaits our heroes, and the Doctor is brought before Davros one more time, as Daleks begin desposing of those who are a threat to Davros'  cunning plans.   Want to know what happens between the Doctor, Davros and the Daleks? Order Doctor Who-Revelation of the Daleks when it comes out on DVD. This is one Doctor Who adventure you won't want to miss!+dvd
boring+N+Didn't like this one to much starts off ok and take a nose dive.  The ending was crapping were stitch all of a sudden is well when he was dying.  I like the first one much more than this one+dvd
The story of the murder and funeral that galvanized the Civil Rights Movement+P+It was in August of 1955 that 15-year-old Emmett Till was sent from Chicago by his mother to spend the summer with his great uncle, Moses Wright, in Money, Mississippi.  On August 24, Till and some other black teenagers who had been picking cotton went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to get some candy.  In the store Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant.  When her husband returned from a trip several days later and heard about the incident, Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam decided to "teach the boy a lesson."  On August 28, they kidnapped Till from his uncle's house, too him to a plantation shed, brutalized the boy, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie river, having tied a seventy pound fan from a cotton gin around Till's neck with barbed wire.  The two men were tried and found not guilty by an all-white jury.  In January 1956 their confession was paid for and published by "Look" magazine.  Both men would die from cancer, Milam in 1980 and Bryant in 1990.    I do not remember when I first heard of Emmett Till, but the story of the black teenager who was killed by white men in Mississippi for the crime of whistling at a white woman was a pivotal event in energizing the Civil Rights Movement and I have known about it for a long time.  However, I never saw a photograph of Emmett Till's body until I was at the Seattle Art Museum looking at an exhibit having to deal with depictions of race and gender in art, and there was a small photograph of Till's body on display at his funeral.  The photograph was too small to tell any details, but you were struck by the swollen and misshaped head.  It did not look human, but then to Milam and Bryant, Emmett Till was never a human being.  The title of Keith A. Beauchamp's documentary is "The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till," not because the story has not been told, but because the people he interviewed, including Till's mother, Mamie Carthan Mobley, along with several cousins and friends from that summer in Mississippi, never had a chance to tell their story in court.  Beauchamp provides them with that opportunity, using newsreel footage from 1955 as well.  It follows the chronology of events, from Till's birth to the present and Beauchamp's own investigations into the case (his chief claim is that up to 14 other people were involved in the crime in various ways).  For just telling the story and covering the facts, Beauchamp keeps things pretty basic in his documentary, letting people speak for themselves.    The most unforgettable part of the documentary is when Mobley tells the story of getting her son's body back home.  Officials in Mississippi wanted to bury the body before anybody got a good look at it and when Mobley managed to get it back to Chicago the coffin was nailed shut.  But she got it opened and then describes what it was she saw in simple and graphic details, emphasizing not the horrors but the child she remembered (e.g., she smiles as she talks about how she thought Emmett's teeth were the most beautiful things she had ever seen and then remembering seeing only two of them and wondering where the rest of them were).  It is only after Beauchamp lets her tell of the pivotal point where she decides to leave the casket open at the funeral so the world can see what was done to her son in Mississippi that we go from a school photograph of a smiling Emmett Till to the wrecked ruin of his face and head.  This is the most disturbing image from the Civil Rights movement, but that is exactly why it is the most important one and why its publication in "Jet" was an important catalyst.  You really cannot tell the story unless you look at the photograph, and teachers who want to show this documentary to their students should be prepared to defend their decision.    In addition to Mobley, it is Moses Wright, who stood up in court and pointed to the two white men who came and took away Till (there is a photograph of the dramatic moment), who stands out here.  But it strikes me that somebody who is not mentioned by name, William Bradford Huie, played a key role as well.  A journalist and author ("The Americanization of Emily," "The Klansman"), Huie was often criticized by mainstream journalists for using his checkbook to get stories.  But it was Huie who paid the murderers to confess in a national publication five months later.  A follow up story revealed that the businesses of Milam and Bryant had gone under because they were ostracized by local whites.  I am sure this did not happen because of the murders, which clearly the jury representing the town supported, but because of the published confession that took away the thin veneer provided by the not guilty verdict.    This documentary received a lot of publicity because it fueled an effort to reopen the case.  The U.S. Department of Justice did reopen the case to determine whether others in addition to Milam and Bryant were involved.  The F.B.I. and Mississippi officials worked on a joint investigation, and while Till's body was exhumed so an official autopsy could be performed, the federal investigation was closed in March of this year.  Consequently, justice in this case will not result in anybody ending up in jail, but rather with preserving the testimony of these witnesses for posterity (Till's mother died after the documentary was completed).  Carolyn Bryant (now Donham after her fourth husband) is still alive and living in Greenville Mississippi.  Signs in her front yard warn that uninvited visitors will be prosecuted, an apparent indication that she believes the law in Mississippi continues to protect her a lot more than it ever did Emmett Till. +dvd
Campy Horror Film Falls Flat+N+Even though originally titled, "Andy Warhol's Dracula", this film had very little to do with Andy Warhol. Udo Kier plays a count visitng Italy to satisfy his "special diet", i.e. "virgin blood." Though the royal family's daughters seem promising, Joe Dellesandro (who uses the Andy Warhol style of "non acting")is busy making them ineligible for the Count's requirements. The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror. Though not as amazingly awful as "Sins of the Fleshapoids" or Ed Wood (who has a certain charm) Blood for Dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next+dvd
Great!+P+I highly recommend this for beginners.  A very good ab workout and it improves flexibility.  Very easy to follow+dvd
Seson 2+P+I love these Girls but, them trying to make it across the states. I am not sure but, they proved my verdict wrong. With their jobs and nicole and paris going to wash their clothes. Finding room mates wanted paper Nicole calling them and paris pretending to be an old man some funny stuff. You will love this season they are brillant. sa sa sa sa. Night B**ch. Nicole and paris are amazing you go girls+dvd
Great!+P+First off to all you 50 Cent haters who keep posting neg reviews for his items, you can all eat a motherf***** d*** in hell.  Anyway I'm a big fan of 50 so I went to the cinema and saw this and it wasn't that bad. I reviewed Tupac's Resurrection a few days ago which I also enjoyed, but it's a documentary this is a real movie! Here is another rapper who started off living in the Ghetto hustling then went to rapstardom. If you like violent films than this is certainly for you, Like I said i'm a 50 Cent fan but you don't have to be a 50 Cent fan to enjoy this movie. It has music from the soundtrack played in it which is another thing you should checkout which is all great. Those of course weren't the songs he was singing back then but we all want to hear new 50. The film is like I said violent with course language, drug reference and sex scenes but it is very entertaining. I saw it twice at the cinema and now I think I will purchase the DVD and so should you.  Awesome+dvd
Awesome+P+This installment to the Yu Yu Hakusho series really helped me find out more about Yoko and Yomi. Very nice, with some excellent fight scenes.   Definately a must to any fan of the series. If you can buy it you should.+dvd
Worst. Movie. Ever.+N+OK I have seen a lot of bad movies but this one takes the prize for worst movie ever. I am generally a big fan of 80's movies, especially 80s high school movies and chick flicks. But this was just so horrendously unfunny, pointless, dull and banal, with unsympathetic, flimsy characters and a weak plot. It tires so hard to be funny and emotional but fails miserably. I mean, the part where she says about how she's with Lloyd because he told her there was glass on the ground is just so artifical and contrived, yet it is supposed to be profound and emotional. I was actually embarassed to return this piece of garbage to the video shop. The two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and I fail to see what on earth John Cusack's character saw in the selfish, stuck up Diane. I can not understand how anyone can give this movie a high rating, I can only assume that you 1. have all been smoking crack or 2. are all the same person. Thank goodness Cameron Crowe's films got better. Please, don't buy this pile of junk if you have any brains! It will be two hours of you life wasted+dvd
Top Notch Instructional DVD+P+What a player and a super teacher, to boot (methodical and articulate).  Slide has always been a struggle for me.  Wish I had picked this up years ago because Warren quickly demystified it for me.   +dvd
Amazing!  Brings Colonial India To Life.+P+As a great fan of the book, I was slightly apprehensieve about seeing the TV series.  However, I really feel it does the book justice and brings the characters and India to life with its fantastic scenery and sumptuous costumes.  Amy Irving is perfect as Anjuli and although unsure at first of Ben Cross's performance, I soon warmed to him as Ash.  The picture on the DVD was really good, as was the sound.  A must see DVD for anyone who is interested in the history of India+dvd
Remarkable!  Pure Visual Poetry+P+Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico is a film that captures the majesty, awe, and tragedy of Mexico better than any other I have ever seen.  And it does so not with dialogue or plot, but rather thru "a sequence of short novellas" (Eisenstein's words) which each develop and play convincingly into the next.  Each of these vignettes to me display a celebration of real Mexican culture and a subtle depreciation of those things which came from Spain.  They evoke the heart of true Mexican patriotism as if it were struck directly from a Rivera mural.  For anyone interested in Mexico or Mexican cinema, Que Viva Mexico is an absolute must.      Que Viva Mexico is certainly one of the most famous "unfinished" films in history, with a tragic star-laced history about which whole books have been published.  In a few words, Sergei Eisenstein went to Hollywood but was almost immediately ostracized by the old studio moguls.  Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin led him to the famed moralist, communist, and novelist Upton Sinclair, who agreed to finance a south-of-the border film.  The budget was $25k and shooting was to take four months.  Sinclair's brother-in-law was to tag along and supervise.  A couple of Eisenstein's Russians comrades would handle the cinematography and equipment.    Exactly what happened after that is a matter of some dispute, including countless cross and counter accusations of extremely lewd behavior and fabulous revelry.  What is certain is that after 11 months in Mexico the film was still missing its final section and Sinclair pulled the plug on the whole operation.  Furious, he then managed to block Eisenstein's return to America and convince Stalin he had been a poor communist.  Sinclair kept all the footage and Eisenstein was sent back to Russia in shame.  Eisenstein still believed he could make a great film out of his footage and fought to get it back, but Sinclair refused and had it edited by his own Hollywood producer.  From this work came the feature Thunder Over Mexico (1933) and the shorts Eisenstein in Mexico (1933) and Death Day (1934).  While these versions influenced great future directors like Welles, Huston, Bunuel, and Leone, they were not the real vision of the great director.  In the 1970s, the Russians finally got the reels, and Grigori Aleksandrov, who had been there and assisted with the original filming, put it back together following Eisenstein's original plan.     Back to the film, it is essentially a silent with narration, a music track, and limited sound effects added.  I don't have any problem with this as the alternative would have been to fabricate intertitles which would have been even less natural.  Anyway talkies were already completely dominant by 1932 and Chaplin used a sound effect track in all his later silents.  The musical track is sheer magic and certainly benefits from the extra years.  There is an abrupt break when the final unfilmed section is reached, before we are taken back to the Day of the Dead epilogue.  Frankly, I don't think much was lost here: Eisenstein was right when he said he didn't need that last segment to finish the film.  The third segment was already just a bit long, and adding the fourth (a continuation of the third) would have unbalanced the film.  Hence I would have just run the third segment straight into a more somber start of the epilogue.  But the way it was done does show us what was "lost", so in that sense it is valid.  My only qualm with this DVD is the fact that it doesn't have Spanish subtitles, as I think all Mexicans should experience this film!    One last thing:  the 1946 epoca dorada classic Enamorada by famed Mexican director Emilio Fernandez could be seen as a sort of tribute film to Eisenstein and Que Viva Mexico, as it basically fills out a story based on the sodadera lost segment of this film.    +dvd
stupid+N+I love Vincent Price and have many of his movies but this one I wish I had not bought. It is really stupid. It was one of his later movies that he probably made just to have work +dvd
It is an ok movie+P+This updated version of this movie is quiet a change from the book. But, just because it is a change from the book isn't a good reason for me not to like it. I did like the movie over all and I thought that the point that the director tried to make came across fine. Even though there were no adults there, the children did develop a "government" and those differences came out in the group that won compared to the group that lost followers. Also, in developing a "government" there was a hierachy of leadership and blood shed. See the movie for yourself and come to your own conclusions about the movie. For myself, I did enjoy it and will probably see it again+dvd
Poor adaptation+N+As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.  Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: "OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters," and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.  I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt "1984." That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single "Big Brother is Watching You." Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, "Kill the pig, spill her blood!" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, "We killed a pig." That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, "KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to "Tell me about the rabbits, George."  On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when "something something" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.  This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion+dvd
Super Challenging Workout+P+I have been using other advanced balance ball workouts for a few years now, but was humbled during Phase I, the least difficult routine.   I am now able to complete all the exercises and improve a little each time I do the workout.   Phase I will continue to challenge me just by adjusting my position on or near the ball.  I don't see how anyone could outgrow this DVD.   Adam is just amazing in Phase 2 and 3.   As with his other DVDs, I love that Adam provides form pointers but doesn't chatter endlessly throughout the routine.  I also appreciate that he doesn't count every rep+dvd
Yea Great to See 2 Kickboxer Films at once, unless they 1&amp;2+N+Yea it is great to see 2 Kickboxer films on the same casette if its only 1 and 2,if you wanna see any Kickboxer films, get 1 and 2, not the worst ones, 3 and 4.Get 1 and +dvd
Disappointed with new voices+N+We just purchased this item and when we got home and loaded it up, was very disappointed in the new voice they're using for Bob, Lofty and Spud!  The video itself is great and they've introduced a new off-road 4x4 machine.  But honestly, it just doesn't seem like a Bob the Builder without the main voices we're all used to+dvd
The Last Picture Show Meets Von Ryan's Express+N+Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often+dvd
Eastwood's Best+P+Very entertaining western/action/drama. Clint Eastwood's best role ever. It is very violent and there is some strong language. So don't be fooled by the PG rating - it's not for kids. There's a pretty intense attempted rape scene as well. I detected no real political agenda except maybe a shot at nationalism, which deserves to be shot+dvd
Good Thought Provoking Themes Well Done+P+Although some people might not like the melancholic feel of this movie, it a well done piece exploring the theme of personal redemption and forgiveness.  People don't always approach these topics in the same way and this movie doesn't try to spin a single, simple answer.  The notable cast works well creating a compelling tale.  A great movie to talk about after viewing.   Highly recommend+dvd
Kinda Dull+N+These old movies are best kept in your memory.  When you rewatch them, it becomes so clear that they're like ancient history.  Weirdly, 1960's movies are more dated than those of the 1920's.  What was going on in that decade that caused people to make heroes of anti-heroes that are litttle more than dirty criminals?  The only redeeming part of the film is the setting in the Cajon Pass before the rampage of urbanization that is quickly destroying it+dvd
some of the best of Pokemon+P+think Pokemon is cool? of course you do. well Electric Shock Showdown  and Battle Aboard the St. Anne are some of the best. for true pokemon fans it was very exciting to see Pikachu vs. Raichu. Team Rocket begins to worry  after the first match that pikachu lost, that Pikachu wasn't as valuable as  they thought and should persue other villainess deeds, but in the end with  an ability not known to Raichu, Pikachu, the underdog, comes out on top  again. When Team Rocket henchmen try to capture a ship load of pokemon  trainers' pokemon, the trainers join forces putting charmander with  charmander and geodude with geodude to force Rocket off the ship but then a  storm results in the evacuation and capsizing of the ship Ash must find and  get back his first captured pokemon, butterfree, and James to get back a  Majikarp he squanderd his and Jesse's money on,however the ship sinks with  him and his friends trapped in side..+dvd
Northern Exposure-complete third season+P+Once you get started collecting this series, you'll want them all.  The show gets better as it goes along. +dvd
DON'T believe it every time they say "director's cut"+N+This is Michael (LAST OF THE MOHICANS, HEAT, THE INSIDER) Mann's far superior, first film adaptation of Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON. It's superb. Creepy, tense, edgy, slick when you don't expect to be, and genuinely even-handed about the story's anti-hero Will Graham and the supposed monster Francis Dolarhyde (portrayed as no less a human than the cops who pursue him), MANHUNTER is a artfully crafted thriller that stands apart from the other "Hannibal the Cannibal" films. I also far prefer Brian Cox as Lektor, he gets under your skin without making an incision, while Anthony Hopkins splattered the screen with patent medecine ookiness.  That said.... I was very disappointed when I rented this particular set. The second, "director's cut" version is clearly a pre-release work print, with lower grade titles and dubbing, and a final scene of Graham visiting near-victim family #3 that is just terrible.   The first disc is the release version, and though it restores a few scenes which were snipped from the VHS cut, a quick line from the scene in which Graham figures out how Dolarhyde is picking his victims is "missing." ("As a child my heart bleeds for him ... as an adult ... slaughters whole families for selfish, trivial ends. ... Are you uncomfortable with this kind of understanding?") Whether it really needs to be in the scene is arguable. Mann may've removed it from the final version for good reasons. He sneers at his friend and former colleague, Crawford. Alienates him. It's a false climax in a scene when the REAL climax is the storeroom guard (on the phone) confirming Graham's breakthrough discovery about the mountain of forensic evidence.   Other than that, the first disc is superbly transferred. If you've only seen this on tape, the clarity and color saturation of the original film will amaze you. Save your pennies, buy the "release version" single disc release, and let Canal/Anchor Bay learn that mis-labled "director's cuts" just won't sell.+dvd
Unforgettable story+P+This is the true story of Teena Brandon (Hillary Swank), a lonely teenage girl living as a man, "Brandon Teena."  She's been in trouble with the law and has no roots.  When she comes to a new town, she is befriended by a "family" of perpetually drunk low-lifes, and is especially attracted to Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who dreams of going to Memphis and being a karaoke singer.  Brandon and Chloe fall in love, angering two men who begin to suspect Brandon's true identity.  Swank's performance as Brandon/Teena is simply remarkable.    She conveys the heartbreak and misery of an outsider, a misfit, and the need for love that is universal; she won the Oscar in 1999 for this role.  Sevigny is convincing as the girl who falls in love with both Brandon and Teena.  Despite its low-budget (Swank earned only $3,000), this is an extremely well-made, thought-provoking, and deeply moving for adults.  (There are sexual and extremely violent scenes.)  A riveting, shocking, and very sad story with sensitive acting and direction+dvd
Displaced from NY/NJ +P+Growing up as a kid in the NY metro Area, March of the Wooden Soldiers was always on WPIX Channel 11 every Thanksgiving. It had become a tradition in the family to watch it every year. After being transferred to Maryland, I have been unable to find it on any station (all 385 on cable). This version has both the colorized and the ORIGNAL Black & White version on the disc. It is wonderful!! Worth every penny for the memories and to keep the tradition alive with my children+dvd
Crappy DVD that should have been called "Things that make you go EWWW!"+N+I expected interviews with the band and concert footage, kind of like Pink Floyd's "Classic Albums: Making Of Dark Side Of The Moon" DVD. Instead, this just has interviews with critics, fans, and people who call themselves "experts" on MCR. If something says "Unauthorized" then do not buy it.   Hopefully, THE BLACK PARADE album will be better+dvd
hilarious yet still gross+P+i bought the movie because i needed something stupid to watch and it is just that.  i enjoy stupid funny movies at times and so whenever i am feeling down i put this in and it helps me out.  there are some gross parts of the movie just like in the show, but you would expect nothing less from the group+dvd
Another bad movie starring Anna Nicole Smith??? Could it be?+N+Ok this is another one of Anna's pointless films. It sucked. I think instead of renting this video send your $2 to anna so she can pay for some acting classes+dvd
More a tribute to 70's Steve Martin than Silvers+P+Though based on the famous character in Phil Silver's famous oldie TV show, the new "Sergeant Bilko" is less an homage to that show than it is to the classic Steve Martin of his 1970's days. Though this Bilko (again a shifty and tireless grafter, the evil face of non-coms everywhere) is very much the opportunist that Silvers' character was (he runs the base casino), as shy of risk as Silvers was (the unit's mobilization orders for Desert Storm mysteriously disappeared) and manages to get caught in his own dealings as Silvers had (Bilko botches the fixing of an Army boxing match, unwittingly tricking each boxer to think he's the one who's supposed to take a fall) the screwball zaniness is very much out of Steve Martin's SNL days.   The script has Bilko's unit charged with testing a brand new army weapon - a "hovertank" that is soon to be cancelled because, among other things, it simply doesn't work. That the hovertank's end will spell doom for his own cozy position doesn't seem to bother Bilko, mostly because he lives day-to-day. Things change when the officer charged with evaluating the hovertank turns out to be the fearsome Major Thorn (Phil Hartman).  Years earlier, Bilko unwittingly made an enemy of Thorn by accidentally implicating him in one of his bitched schemes. Now a major, Thorne isn't simply content enough to eliminate the Hovertank, but must now axe Bilko as well. They say that desperate times reveal the man, and Bilko is now revealed to be the spineless weasel his troops have come to love. Martin plays Bilko like a character from one of his old SNL skits. It's sort of fun to watch the guy work on material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ("LA Story", "Roxanne") and more mature dramatic roles ("The Spanish Prisoner", "Grand Canyon" and that update of "Silas Marner"). It's light and breezy and you'll probably forget most of the gags, and the script under-uses most of the supporting cast (especially the now late-great Phil Hartman as Bilko's evil nemesis), but it's still fun+dvd
Lame+N+Two problems.  First problem.  Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer.  For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City.  What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away?  One in ten million?  Twenty million?   Second problem.  The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void.  In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward+dvd
SO MUCH FUN!+P+These old movies are so much fun to watch!  They are just genuine good fun!+dvd
Not that funny nor that entertaining+N+Few sequels live up to the original, and I consider that the case here.  Picking up where the first movie left of, the action quickly moves as Farmer Hoggett falls into a well and hurts himself, the wife fails at farming, so she and Babe go to the city to find help.  Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day.  The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one.  Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite.  Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes.  The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better.  The overall look of the movie is darker too; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky, we have concrete, roads, and building walls.  This reviewer did not like this movie that much, and was disappointed.  +dvd
airwolf-1+P+It is great to see the old show's being brought back to DVD. I really enjoyed watching this DVD and season 2. Keep bringing the old show's back on DVD+dvd
19th Century Incredibles+N+There have been far too many sequels to too many original films that were much more stellar. "The Legend of Zorro", unfortunately, is another.    Whereas the 1998 original was more along the lines of a blockbuster, this 2005 sequel has proven to be lackluster.  Antonio Banderas, as Alejandro De la Vega,has taken his late father-in-law's name, and is now more at ease in his role as a nobleman of mid-19th-century California. He is still donning the mask and making sojourns to help the oppressed and dispossessed of the region. But he now has a wife and child to consider and the tensions between the swashbuckler and his equally daring young wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones)mount when she begins to fear for the safety of their son, Joaquin.   As Joaquin, Adrian Alonso reveals that the genes for the spunk and cunning of the De La Vegas have not worn thin as he defies authority to help defeat the villians of the film. At intervals, the family become the 19th century's precursor to the animated Incredibles with the skills and technology available to them.  As another reviewer noted, the story loses its credibility when Elena and Alejandro divorce due to her concerns for her son's safety. This would have been extremely rare  in the 19th century, and unheard of in a Catholic country at that time.   Elena reunites with a former acquaintance she met during her years in Spain, a French nobleman named Armand(a piercing-eyed, striking Rufus Sewell) in whose house she and her son become guests, and whom Elena finds to have sinister designs on California, not unlike the abductor she had believed to be her father for many years.  The "Zorro" franchise recycles Tony Amendola as a priest trying to teach students such as Joaquin, whereas he had been a devious henchman to Don Rafael in the 1998 film, and lets us glimpse Mary Crosby, a quarter century after the height of her popularity, in a non-speaking role as a Governor's wife, reassuring us that there are no small roles, only small actors.  While it has a few impressive moments, the script is a tired rehash of the original theme, and the outcome is predictable, literally hinging on the ability to get on the right track.  Young Adrian Alonso appears to have a bright future ahead of him, and I hope that Antonio and Catherine enjoyed their onscreen reunion.  But generally, it simply does not have the sizzle of its 1998 predecessor, and there was a lot of time and money that could have been better spent+dvd
Okay, but VERY techincal+N+If you are looking for video of actual bomb tests, this video is NOT for you. It is basically actual D.O.D reels declassified. It shows many in-depth testing measuring blast waves, heat etc. Good if you are of the sceintific nature, but gets a little boring if you are just looking for some 'action'+dvd
We love Little Bear!+P+My 3 year old daughter loves Little Bear. It airs on Noggin just in time for me to make dinner and it is her wind down time during the day. When she is feeling sleepy or just needs some quiet time, Little Bear always does the trick. The DVD is great with so many episodes. My daughter and I were more than happy with it. I would recommend this for any child between 2 and 6. (Actually I catch my older kids watching sometimes too!!+dvd
Matthew is Right!+P+The only thing that would be better Matthew would be if it had the footage of Michael Jordan squealing the tires on his Mercedes and pouting after he was fired from the Washington Wizards.  Better yet would be if it had footage of him cheating on his wife with porn stars - Or writing the payola checks for them to shut up!  You are right - Excellent video+dvd
Yep. Way too expensive.+N+I agree with "Huntsmen". $600 for a bunch of dusty old Doctor Who eps? No way.  For that kind of money, I would want THE ENTIRE SERIES on DVD. You can get 7 years of TNG for about that? Same for X-files+dvd
DVD purchase+N+I am stationed in Iraq and recently purchased The Hunter(Steve McQueen) through Amazon and when I received it and went to play it, the disk started skipping. I guess this gives me the opportunity to ask what I can do, if anything to return the DVD and get it replaced. My DVD player is new and I have since watched a couple of other new DVDs in it with no problem. I have made other purchases through Amazon, but this was a really disappointing experience.+dvd
I am a carebear fanatic BUT...+N+...I will have to shoot myself if I am forced to watch this again.  The animations are very annoying, the court jesterish feel is very annoying and the portrayal of Funshine Bear (my favorite) as a pre-teenaged boy jokester is NOT my idea of what carebears is about. I was NOT impressed with this movie+dvd
The Bonzo's in all their Absurd Magnificence+P+I gave this video five stars because it is the only thing I've seen yet that has actual moving pictures of the Bonzo Dog Band.  Being that they weren't on TV in the US at all during the 60's, it is quite amazing to be able to see them here in all their original glory. I was completely open mouthed amazed with all of them. Vivian of course was a major howl, but the rest of the lads were right up there with him.  Roger Ruskin Spear in particular was a major scream.  Rodney Slater was a real oddity as well and Legs Larry was hilarious.  So was Neil.  It was just so amazingly great to come upon this.  Like coming upon a time capsule.  There is quite a bit of the Bonzos throughout these shows.  Unfortunately, most of it is not done live, however it is fascinating to hear a lot of their songs in developmental stages. There is almost an hour and a half of Bonzo material on these disks. There are no chapter stops except for the beginning of each show.  There is no copy guard either, so it is possible to assemble all the Bonzo clips on your own disc. This is what I did using a hard disc DVD recorder.  It all worked out beautifully and made the purchase of these DVD's very much worth it.  As for the comedy bits with all the others on the show, well, there are a few things but it really is truly amazing how much improved things got when the Pythons became the Pythons.  I bought this for the Bonzos and it did not disappoint+dvd
fun with adolph and joseph+P+great to see gregory peck having such a good time playing arch-menace joseph mengele. the plot is plausible, if somewhat naive and short in the hard science department, but i'd suspend my disbelief to watch sir laurence olivier play this nazi hunter anyday. the rest of the cast are a bit like card board cut-out villians and good guys, but the boy hittler is a kid only a she-wolf mother could love+dvd
Ballet Class for One Side Only+N+This is a ridiculous DVD as it only has class ON ONE SIDE OF THE BODY. It's insane to have rewind between every movement to be able to do the other side. Nobody in their right mind should buy this; a total waste of money.+dvd
On my most favorite list+P+I first picked this up out of the bargain bin at the video store. I was mostly interested in the music. I had seen another movie with a Cajun story line called "Southern Comfort" and discovered I loved the music. So, I bought Belizaire b/c I wanted to have the music. And make no mistake, the music is great! But I was majorly surprised at how wonderful the movie is! I stand in agreement with the other reviewers - this is well worth owning. Its one you'll want to see repeatedly. I know I still enjoy it every time I watch it, and its been many times over the years.+dvd
Out Of Order.. ? incomplete is more accurate !+N+I was so excited when I saw this title released on DVD. I then foolishly puchased it not knowing they ruined it, and released it as a poor mini-movie of the Showtime series. I still cannot believe how Showtime butchered this wonderful series into to 90 odd minutes of total garbage. Is it any wonder why Showtime always places a distant second to HBO on all of their productions +dvd
Deceptive title. Two hours wasted when I could have had a root canal.+N+The title of this movie is a tad deceptive- it and the soundtrack are the only thing disco related to this soap opera of a movie that carries a script worthy of a "Sex and the City" episode. There are some, albeit very few, interesting plot twists. But basically this movie is mostly worthy of a late night movie made by and for Cinemax. Pity too. I'm a huge Chloe Sevigny fan (and not for "Brown Bunny" reasons), but her talent is minimally utilized, as is that of her co-stars. I realize this movie is largely about recent college grads and their pretentious entrance into the real world, with the disco night life as a back drop. But their trials and tribulations have little to do with the disco life itself. "The Club," the flick's disco night life place to be, is merely what Central Perk was to the TV show friends- a gathering place to gossip about relatively juvenile adventures in love (or reasonable facsimiles of), and their recent and up to now short durations in the working world. The minimal glances into "The Club" itself is archetypal. Were it not for an admittedly clever twist that explains a lot of the behavior of that disco's employees earlier in the movie, the dialogue would be largely mundane, uninspired and testing of the viewers patience. The pay off isn't rewarding enough to rescue one from that experience. Kate Beckinsdale's character is the stereotyical pain in the [...], nose in her friends' business nuisance, and she plays that well. But an annoying character does not a good movie make. And for a movie of this title, the dance scenes are minimal in quantity and display. Were it not for a friend letting me borrow his copy, I wouldn't have even dropped a single dollar to rent this flick. To be fair, the soundtrack is outstanding and solely keeps one following the movie's events. But that's hardly a reason to waste a couple hours watching this film's paint dry. You could probably buy the soundtrack and have a more entertaining experience+dvd
Holo Mai Pele+P+This spectacular and powerful singing and dance performance (and the excellent commentaries)telling the story of the Fire Goddess, Pele, and her sister Hiiaka, gives deep insights into Hawaiian culture and religious belief and is wonderful to watch.  For me it helps keep alive memories of my own visit to Hawaii and the Volcanoes National Park.  Should be of interest to anyone who loves traditional dance and/or mythology.+dvd
Big Fat Hit+P+My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a great movie! My mother loved it when we saw it in theaters, and I got it for her for Christmas and she still loves it. Great movie+dvd
The Long-forgotten  Misunderstood Chevy Chase Movie+P+When I was 12 this movie was a staple on the then still-blossoming HBO.  I think I've watched it or seen bits and pieces of it like more than thirty times. As a kid there were a lot of things I didn't get, of course, but it was funny to me. Now, that was 1982.  Twenty-three years later I saw it on Amazon and nostalgia just washed over me.  I had to have it.  Finally, I thought, Modern Problems and Foul Play have been released to DVD, two childhood staples...  I watched both movies.  Modern Problems was as I remembered it, mostly.  I get all the jokes and situations now that I'm an adult, of course, but there were some other things I got as well.  This isn't the happy-go-lucky Chevy Chase that we all remember from Cassyshack and Seems Like Old Times, this is the darker side.  Modern Porblems has its share of ridiculousness, but beneath the surface, this is a pretty dark comedy.  When Chevy uses his telekinetic powers to make his ex-girlfriend's date's nose start bleeding, Jesus it is hysterical, but at the same time...when you have a chance to think about it...quite grim.  There is an underlying 'life sucks' theme going on here which was where the world was in 1981 and I think this movie captures that pretty well.  Is this my favorite Chevy Chase movie? No. Fletch and Vacation and Christmas Vacation and Caddyshack are.  There's been a lot of others, too.  Is this a classic?  I'd say, yes.  Here is 1981 all rolled up and categorized in a comedy by the reigning star of the time.  A little slice of Regan-era fatalism.  Enjoy+dvd
Do not embarrass yourself by watching this+N+Apparantly my first review was censored by Amazon, so here goes again.  This movie is, by far, the worst film i've ever tried to watch.  I say 'tried' because after two separate attempts I couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film.  This is coming from someone who gave Eraserhead 5 stars, so take this as a very bad sign.  Long story short, Andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant, flaky, artsy stuff.  For example, imagine the most self-important Art major you've ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten.  Or anything completely nonsensical such as that, that is the level of conversation these men have in this film.  I watched this movie because it was compared to a scene in Linklater's Waking Life (which was intelligent and thought-provoking).  IF you pay the absurd amount of money they are asking for this DVD, there is something wrong with you+dvd
Worth Every Penny+P+Anyone interested in the way a cold-blooded killer's mind works will be fascinated by this DVD.  I got shivers watching it.  Product arrived in mint condition and before the seller stated it would.  I would definitely buy again from this seller+dvd
What is the hype???+N+This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, "I think I'm pregnant," then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, "I think I'm pregnant."  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it+dvd
Horrible Audio, No Teaching+N+These other reviewers are kidding you.   There are significant problems with this dvd. 1. The audio on this dvd is horrible.  It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube.  I could have done better in my garage. 2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin.  There is no teaching whatsoever.  I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this+dvd
Did I miss something???+N+I saw this a few nights ago on regular late night tv, so maybe it was edited to death and I missed all the interesting parts???? All I know is that it seemed highly unbelievable... Spoilers follow....(...why does the rapist just walk in her front door...would you leave your door unlocked if you had just been attacked and the rapist had your driver's license?!!) Anyways...I couldn't get past that part through the whole movie, so maybe that's what made me hate it. I do have to give kudos to Farah Fawcett though, her acting was excellent and seemed very genuine...maybe she has been through some similar trauma in real life?+dvd
I can't imagine...+P+...I'm the only one who noticed that, besides the satire about managements, unions, and their relations, there is also one, although briefer nonetheless most interesting, about 'Justice', who decides that if one is guilty of honesty, it can only happen by reason of insanity, and, therefore must be committed. Leaving management going on with their cheating schemes, workers thinking that getting their paycheck is working hard enough, and unions' leaders going on encouraging sabotage, following USSR directions, absolutely blind to the fact that, if doing one tenth of the same stuff in USSR, they would have been -at best- sent to the siberian salt mines used as reeducation camps+dvd
Skip this movie.+N+Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent+dvd
Beautifully Filmed But For Me A Waste of Time+N+I recently saw Brideshead Revisted which I found completely wonderful. It was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films I've ever immersed myself in.   So, hungry for more Evenlyn Waugh (whose books I read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work), I found "A Handful Of Dust" at my library and figured I'd give it a try. Since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as Brideshead I was filled with anticipation.   My wife and I watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments, and was certainly beautifully filmed, we were left cold by it. But we figured maybe after that the movie would develop.    So we decided to continue it the following night. Big mistake!   I only wish I could get back the time I wasted on it. While I don't expect "Happy endings" in a film (Brideshead certainly didn't have a "Happy ending") the ending in this story left me in disbelief.    Since I didn't read this particular book by Waugh and didn't know its ending, I was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did. I was amazed by the stupidity of all I had just witnessed.    I thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if Tony would "toughen up" a little, transform and grow from the circumstances of his "captivity" rather than just look like a pathetic fool.    Perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching Brenda get what she deserved, still it wasn't enough to justify watching this film.    This film was basically a "series of unfortunate events", with myself feeling most unfortunate of all.   My wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than I did.     Compared with a film like Brideshead Revisited, where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth, This story, was full of one dimensional characters. Dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery, well written music and excellent cinematography still didn't save the story from being like a bad "twilight zone" episode.   If you look up my reviews, you will see that I don't go out of my way to give bad reviews, but I was so annoyed by the time I wasted I felt I need to share this. Of course I have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review, but I felt maybe I could spare someone else the wasted time.      +dvd
Do The Hustle:  Newman Makes Fast Eddie Felson A Hollywood Legend+P+Let's face it, what can I possibly say about Robert Rossen's exquisitely hard-edged classic that hasn't been said before?  "The Hustler" is an astounding and uncompromising drama that seems as fresh today as it did 45 years ago.  So often we'll look back at the classics--and, as is appropriate, they might seem dated.  Times change and that is reflected in cinema.  "The Hustler," though, is one of the rare films that was so sophisticated, so intelligent, and so honestly raw--that its power has not been diminished by the years.  Set in a very unglamorous world of pool halls and back rooms, "The Hustler" is a testosterone fueled excursion into the life and pursuits of one of Hollywood's most notorious anti-heroes--Fast Eddie Felson.  Nominated for eight Oscars, this refreshingly adult film cemented Paul Newman's status as one of our greatest actors.  The story of "The Hustler" is surprisingly simplistic.  A brash young pool shark sets his sights on defeating one of the game's greatest players--Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason, at his best).  But getting up on Fats isn't enough--no, he wants to crush his opponent.  Eddie's naked and uncompromising drive eventually becomes his undoing as his winning streak turns to defeat.  Despondent and broke, Eddie aligns with an equally desperate love interest.  Sarah, played by Piper Laurie (never better), is a bitter alcoholic who has given up on life.  But her complicated romance with Eddie seems to hint at the possibility of new hope.  Eddie, however, can't change his spots overnight and an encounter with an unscrupulous manager (George C. Scott) just might get Eddie a second chance at Fats.  For good or for bad, it seems Eddie is destined to go down that road again.  Paul Newman imbues Eddie with much cockiness, bravado, arrogance, ambition, and even desperation.  In my opinion, it is Newman's best and most multi-layered performance.  This (along with "Hud") celebrated Newman as a new type of leading man--someone you could like and despise at once.  Morally questionable, perhaps even amoral at times, Newman was not afraid to be despicable.  While only Oscar nominated for this film, ironically he won roughly 25 years later for reprising Eddie for "The Color of Money."  Laurie, Scott, and Gleason all picked up Oscar nods as well.  The film is impeccably acted and beautifully filmed.  Not just for those with an interest in pool, "The Hustler" is a searing drama that stands as a deft character study of a man figuring out what is important after all.  While the Collector's Edition seems to be handsomely packaged as a two disc set, whether or not it's worth the upgrade from the Special Edition seems a bit suspect.  Both have widescreen presentation, commentary from Newman and "Time" film critic Richard Schickel (among others), and features on "How to Make The Shot" and "The Hustler: The Inside Story."  This new addition adds four featurettes--"Life in the Fast Lane: Fast Eddie Felson and The Search for Greatness," "Milestones in Cinema History: The Making of The Hustler," "Swimming with Sharks: The Art of the Hustle," and "Paul Newman: Hollywood's Cool Hand."  So it's a judgment call whether or not you feel these extra shorts will add to your viewing experience.  If you don't own the film, then it's a no-brainer!  Either way, "The Hustler" is a true classic.  One of Newman's best (if not best) performances make this gritty and timeless drama a must own DVD.  KGHarris, 04/07+dvd
I LOVED IT!!!!!+P+I bought this recently, when i was about to watch it I thought it was going to be the stupidest thing i have ever seen. But after the first few minutes i loved it. The special effects were good (for 1914) The only thing i didnt like is the WEIRD music and the naration. Whats wrong with panio or organ music+dvd
What the fork is this!?+N+Okay, ignoring the obvious fact that Pyun made this... "film"... out of the scum that stuck to his shoes after walking through the cutting rooms of 3 or 4 other really crappy movies - all involving... cityscapes and leather, I'd guess... Where was I... Oh yeah. And leaving aside the question of whether any of these actors has every really been good (I love them all, you understand, but I also "like" Starbucks coffee when Kona isn't available - ie all the time except payday)... Um, I feel that what sums this hunk of celery up is that the bad guys "hide" a huge bomb on the roof of the San Francisco city hall, and then have a bunch of henchboobs "guard" it so's Hopper and Pressly can get out of range.  Now, let's recognize that city halls don't tower over every other building in any city on earth (this is reserved for the buildings of banks, insurance companies and general commercial piracy outfits). Which means authorities would be able to see the spear carriers guarding the bomb and act accordingly. This you could see in any bad movie. Perhaps not in the light of the feeling that some of the guards might wonder who would be guarding the bomb while it was their turn to get out of range, though. And how, really, do you sneak a bomb the size of an elephant onto the roof of a city hall. Even pre 9/11 my imagination failed.  But here's where I had to look under the bottom of the disc's case to see if somehow, something had fallen out of it. Can I really believe Ice-T would play a man stupid enough to attempt to take this roof by force? No ladies and gents, a bad movie can be the most fun you'll ever have with your clothes on, but this Ticker goes too far, crosses a line (trips over it actually), and stumbled into chaos. It was like having Korean subtitles on under a Cantonese audio track on a Mime film of about Ladan as told by Swedish Esperantists.  And if you're high enough to actually enjoy such a thing I'd suggest something in a medium budget Godzilla, instead+dvd
No Is Not An Answer!+P+If you like gangster flicks, especially of the Cockney 'firm' variety, then you need to see this movie. SEXY BEAST is a fantastic but underrated indie classic. Like some of the other reviewers, I could watch this movie over and over again.  Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired London mobster now living in Spain, going to fat in idyllic bliss with his former porn actress wife Dee Dee (Amanda Redman) and their best friends, a married couple they've known from when they were back in the life. Into their domestic paradise enters Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), another 'old friend,' showing up unannounced, telling Gal he has a job for him and "No is not an answer."  Logan is one of those small wiry guys who make up for what they lack in height and muscle with an extra dose of psychotic meanness. Crime boss Teddy Bass (excellently played with menacing reticence by Ian McShane) is planning an ambitious heist on a prestigious bank, Logan is to help assemble the crew. Logan wants Gal in on the job and, as far as he's concerned, he's already made Gal's mind up for him. For Logan it is only a matter of how little stroking he will need to do before he strikes.  In one scene, it's late and everyone is in bed, except Logan who is in the bathroom shaving. Standing in front of the mirror he starts thinking about Gal's refusal earlier in the evening. He begins muttering. Needing to relieve himself, he continues thinking and muttering as he urinates all over the floor. By now, having worked himself up into a rage, he runs out the bathroom with shaving cream still on his face, down the hall and, screaming "No! No! No!" storms into Gal and Dee Dee's bedroom kicking and punching the poor man out of his own bed.  Another scene in the movie shows Logan sitting on a plane which will soon depart. Thinking nothing of consideration for fellow passengers, or rules and regulations, he lights up a cigarette. When one of the passengers mildly protests, Logan calmly but coldly informs the man that if he must put out the cigarette, he will be putting it out on him. When a flight attendant intervenes, Logan gets up, grabs his bag and --after telling all onboard he hopes the plane crashes and they all die-- demands to get off. After being removed and brought to airport security, Logan explains to the security officer the incident was all a case of nerves. He concocts a tale about a male flight attendant groping him while boarding! With a straight face, he tells the man that he felt violated and was literally in shock, not even realizing he was smoking a cigarette! Of course, he doesn't wish to make a fuss about any of it and would just like to leave and forget the whole thing.   He walks out the airport, right into a taxi and back to making Gal's life hell. I couldn't stop laughing!  Ben Kingsley does for SEXY BEAST what Joe Pesci did for GOODFELLAS. Both portray sociopaths, incapable of true consideration and comapassion. The way they selfishly crash through life is so disturbing it's comes off comical.  Not giving too much of the story away, but Gal does return to London to do the job. However, not for the reasons you might think. Instead, something occurs which makes Gal feel it necessary to get to London, complete the job and return to Spain quickly as possible. Ian McShane is brilliant in this final segment of the film. +dvd
Just another DVD of legends...+N+SeriousDon't expect much from this DVD  Spiderwowan: 0 stars Crevices: 4 Stars The Sacrifice: 2 stars  Blonde Kwaidan: -5 stars (negative) Presentiment- 1 star  The Spiderwoman was just weird. Like low-budget sci-fi. It lacks an actual plot.  *"Crevices", although short, was really creepy- i think that some of the others could have been taken out to add on to this one.   "The Sacrifice" -was pretty pointless too. You know someone will die, none of the characters will call the police or try and solve this - it just plays out. Frusterating to watch. The lead actress however saves this with above average acting.   Blonde Swaidan - TERRIBLE. It's a few minutes long and makes no sense. An obsession with blondes -finding a blonde body. How did this make it in??  "Presentiment" -A weird kind of "Final Destination"/Yogen type of idea here, but it just goes too slow and becomes annoying. By the time you know what's going on, you don't care.  In summary, "Crevices" is a scary little short  4 stars, and the acting in "The Sacrifice" was great, although there was no common sense - don't know how to score that... +dvd
BUYER BEWARE+N+I ordered this on November 2, and even though Amazon have been listing this as being 'in stock' for a week or so, my order still hasn't even shipped yet. I have asked Amazon to provide a reason for this, but they haven't done so... I think it's terribly misleading of Amazon to list something as being 'in stock' when orders placed two months ago haven't been filled yet.  Buyer beware...+dvd
Misunderstood Minds+P+I teach high school and this video did a few things for me. First, it showed me the importance of elementary school teachers in pin pointing learning disabilities. Second, it is important for parents to explore different possibilities for why students aren't performing. I have an 8 yr old nephew who was just diagnosed with severe dislexia and the original prescription was drugs for ADD. Explore the possibilities! Third, the specific story of the teenager drove home the importance of having smaller classes in high school. I have 35 kids in each class. I know that for some, that is small. I have 6 classes. It is impossible for teachers, most of us wish we could, to be able to cater to the needs of each individual student. The video showed the importance of not only giving a correct diagnosis for a students problems, but the importance of following through and working with the student, so he or she can really succeed. The real stories showed the emotion that not only the students go through, but the families as well. It is a firm reminder that children need understanding, not labels. I recommend Misunderstood Minds+dvd
Where's my fabricated half inch pipe?+P+This movie is excellent, and probably much better than any subsequent work done by Moore. My kids love it, especially his lamentation in the bar after being fired. I have to admit that I never was a big Moore fan - his work done with Peter Cook was a bit offensive, and this movie proves that humour need not offend.  Mark Fredericks esq+dvd
Amber Saved it+N+Well . . .Lemme see it wasn't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored, although the opening sex scene with Amber Newman saved it all, the only reason I watch the film over and over and over again, I gave it a whole star just for that scen+dvd
Finally, I'm starting to win+P+This DVD is terrific. Rather than describe the content, as most have, I'll discuss the results.    I'm a rookie that plays with friends every couple of weeks.  I've been playing for less than a year.  I hadn't been a very winning player for a while, but went to Vegas recently.  I watched this DVD and studied the Pre-Flop Strategy, Odds Chart and Hold'em Race Odds charts, and decided to take a chance and enter a low-dollar tournament.  What a blast- I finished 11th out of 51 players.  The next night, I entered another tournament. I made it to the final table and placed in the money- 7th.  Wow, I thought I was going to be taken to the cleaners, but did pretty well against some clearly more experienced veterans.  After returning from the trip, I immediately beat my friends, two games in a row.  I had been getting my butt kicked by them for a couple of months now, so needless to say, this video has really turned my game around.    I didn't realize how much I misunderstood about the game until I watched this video.  I'm doing things in reverse order- now I'm going to purchase the first DVD to make sure I get the basics down, to add to these advanced techniques+dvd
Outstanding tutorial!+P+This DVD is very well done.  Unlike Phil Hellmuth's DVDs (which were suprisingly inadequate), Lederer truly takes the viewer through a number of sound, substantive advice and strategy that acheives its goal -- to provoke thought and to tighten your play.  This very much added to my game and gave more, and different perspective(s) to this wonderful game.  An earlier review claimed that it is "not complete"...to which I would agree, with one caveat -- can any DVD/book/article truly "completely" cover such an intricate game?  Maybe, if it were a collection of 10-12 disks or more...but, even then, there are different perspectives and strategies -- some you may subscribe to , others you may not.  I only wish this DVD had more to it because of the fact that it was very insightful, helpful and instructive...I could have watched another 2 hours of Lederer's teaching.  If you are looking for an instructional course that bucks the trend of those that claim so-called "million-dollar strategies" and fall short, and you want to improve your game -- this DVD pays for itself.  Lederer doesn't hold back, afraid of revealing his secrets that may provide for others to beat him at the table.  He lays it out in a great framework, delivering it in a way that of him really wanting to help you in your game.  Another great attribute -- he doesn't drone on and on about his tourney conquests with an air of how great he is (unlike some other DVDs - no names mentioned  Phil).  In fact, I don't recall him talking about any of his "great moves", except for situations that he has encountered and the results -- good or bad.  Lederer is a confident player, and it shows in his teaching of the game.  Highly recommended!+dvd
Best Disney ever!+P+This Disney is right up there with the tops, like 'Lady and the Tramp'.  It should not be missed. The annimation is wonderful and the characters fabulous, such as the voice of Candy Candido as 'Fidget', and of course Vincent Price, who is priceless as Professor Ratigan. Everyone will love it! +dvd
Newman and Woodward - what else can you ask for?+P+TERRIFIC movie - Newman and Woodward sizzled.  My husband and I watch this and we both think it's one of the best romantic yet gritty movies ever made.  Each character/actor is a gem and the story is timeless.  The only one I might like more is Cat on a Hot Tin Roof with Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor.  Same genre - great performances, great scripts, family realities+dvd
this is "not" reality +N+Hi, I have been waiting to watch this show for along time and was very dissapointed. Everything had been scripted from the cousin wearing a seamore butts teashirt and running around town for diffrent things through the whole show, the mother was boring and Seamor Butts constantly plugging his company! he had avertized through the whole movie, like when he went to a high school reuion and told everybody that he was seamore butts. I bought the second season without watching the first, big mistake!. A BIG 2 THUMBS DOWN! +dvd
worthless trash+N+This is a complete waste of time. There is virtually no plot, the whole point of the movie is the celebrity cameos+dvd
Awesome DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+I won't wax rhapsodically about Ritchie vs Steve, but instead I will just rate the dang DVD.  The musical direction is great. This compilation of tracks recorded at historic Montreux in '96 and '00 is just fantastic. The sound quality is better than most systems are capable of, so you'll probably get the best sound your equipment can give.  I own Purples Australia '99 as well as Scandinavian Nights, New Live and Rare, and the Come Hell or High Water reunion tour with Blackmore. Montreux is in the top two, and I have enjoyed it almost every night since it arrived last month. Paice, Morse, Lord, Glover and Gillan mesh perfectly [as always] and obviously have a great time playing together. They joke around occasionally, and theres a few surprizes that spontaneously erupt on stage [Sooo, thats 'funky Claude' eh? hmmm].  This DP line-up clicks extremely well together, and it shows [I can't believe I am the only one that noticed Gillan giving Blackmore the "finger" at the end of 'Paint it Black' on the High Water DVD. If you got it - watch the last second of that track .. BOING! Up goes the 'bird' at Ritchie, who should have gotten a butt kickin instead of just the finger].  If you are a purple fan, or just a music lover who enjoys those nice long live instrumental riffs of great rock & roll that highlight not only the guitarist but all facets of the bands talents, buy this disk. These guys blend better than Tequila and Lime. Theres plenty of deep-cut material on it I'd bet money you have not heard before and that in itself is reason enough+dvd
Multi-Cultural View of Domestic Violence+P+This movie was good, but as usual the book was far better. I think it showed that her husband had some tendencies towards wanting to dominate his wife, which turned into full-blown abuse under the stresses of losing his job & medical license, and returning to Shiite Iran after decades of living in the United States.  I think the book shows that he wasn't this "dream husband" that suddenly turned into a monster. The warning signs were there all along - for example, she met him when he was her physician and he kissed her right on the treatment table - obviously, an inappropriate action.  What was amazing to me is that OTHER AMERICANS in Iran did little to help Betty, saying she needed to submit, what's the problem? etc, while it was the IRANIANS who understood Moody's family history & reached out to help her in a real way - helping her use the phone, finding ways for her to escape the dangerous oppression of her husband, and ultimately smuggling her out of the country.   The movie seems a little overblown, because, well, it's a movie...they dramatize things. I recommend reading the book, too, which is Betty's true story+dvd
Bronson is suave, but what happened to J. Lee?+N+Not a great film by any means, but mildly diverting. However, all credibility is lost in one key scene.  J. Lee Thompson, director of GUNS OF NAVARONE and the original CAPE FEAR is amazing example of a man whose considerble skills deteriorated over time. This one is OK, but he degernerated even further in his later collaborations with Bronson.  The film lost it for me during a scene where the assorted characters are making an exchange of goods in a drive-in movie. The marquee says something like "Western Double Feature" and if you look at the screen, it's the same 20 second loop of a cattle stampede.   So the other moviegoers drove in not knowing the names of the movies they were seeing and were staring at the same 20 seconds of film run over and over again.  I know from fond memories that drive-ins were make-out hangouts back in the day and we didn't always focus on the movie, but this is ridiculous+dvd
Very good flick+P+I was shocked as I looked at this movie plenty of times and passed it up, until I read an article in Fangoria #244 article on Stuart Gordon, and decied to rent it. I would say the asking price is to high$15 is more reasonable. This movie does not get boring. The action is good, the plot is good, the acting is actually very good. this movie has already been broken down so no need for me to do so. Overall if you are looking for a good movie that will keep you awake and interested check out "King of the Ants", it is a good flick and doubt you will be dissapointed I know I was'nt+dvd
Happy Birthday Mom+N+Okay, let me explain the title.  I call this review Happy Birthday Mom because in the middle of the movie i stopped the movie to call my mom and wish her a happy birthday.  The typical thought would be that I bought this dvd for my mother as a birthday gift, but I do like my mom, so I wouldn't do that to her.  Later in the movie I also stopped it to talk to my friend that lives in Canada.  Yeah, I stopped it to talk to a CANADIAN, thats bad....  Well he's just up there for school, so ya know.  Some of it was good, but it could have done better.  I have the seemingly harder to come by skill of seperating fiction (movie, game, tv) from real life, so I like the kind of shat that upsets fragile people without that skill.  I'm sure some of the violence in this movie made someone cry foul....    And its gets and extra half star simply because Kari Wuhrer is hot in this movie, like every movie she's in!+dvd
This movie made me hungry for fruit roll-ups+N+when the gore looks like fruit roll-ups and that liquid candy. Then it really sucks. No this movie is beyond sucks. Fake-butt explosions and everything.   come on now give me a break+dvd
He Was Her Man+P+A simple movie that can be enjoyed by all ages. (Which is rare today) The songs and great looks of Elvis make this one enjoyable+dvd
Hillraious+P+When I first saw an episode of Little Britain I really didn't know wheather to laugh or turn off the TV. This series has a very bad habit of growing on you and then before you know it you are completly hooked.  You are completly hooked when you start saying..." Yeah..., but no, but yeah..."  to people.  Some of the characters are a little out of left field, but that is what I love about Biritsh comedy. So politicaly uncorrect and full of dirty humor.   Sit down and enjoy the ride....+dvd
a so-so movie adapted from a not-so-good novel+N+this is strictly a dvd production not good for the big screen. a very mediocre screenplay originated from a meidocre novel by one of the once-upon-a-time greatest novelists. sam elliot was a very bad casting choice, he's way too old for this action movie, he looked so tired to move around in almost all the locations. and the on and on flash-backs were the worst and the oldest directing and editing technique to be used in this bad movie. the cia and the cia operatives also looked so lame, so stupid and so unconvincing, they're just a bunch of wimps. the connection between cia and that bosnian mass murderer was also too contrite to be convinced easily. a brainless screenplay worse than the original bad novel.+dvd
Still The Best Sci-fi on Television+P+I grew  up with 'Doctor Who in the 70's. Tom baker was the first doctor who I saw on TV. I remember watching the show with my mom every night @ 7pm. This series brings back alot of memories.......  The story starts off with the doctor and sarah in a quarry in good ol england.....they start walking through the quarry, unknown to them, the workers in the quarry just set explosives right where they are walking.  The next thing the doctor and sarah notice, is a man on top of a ridge waving st them. But the doctor and sarah think he is wazing at them as in hello or help.  the next thing the time travelers know is they are buried in tons of rock, well sarah is anyway, the doctor and some of the workers dig sarah out, she is unconcience and grasping a stone hand..............'THE HAND OF FEAR+dvd
Bad Shipment?+N+I don't know whether it's Amazon or all retailers that have this problem, right now, but HoF freezes at the 13:58 mark. Don't purchase it for a year or so. Let retailers get in a fresh, undamaged shipment, and then try again+dvd

Nothing Indecent about this dull movie. Tame and uninspired+N+Indecent Proposal's intriguing premise starts off with a provocative question: "What would you do if I offered you a million dollars to spend the night with your wife?" In its attempt to explore sexuality, morals and ethics in America, the movie's writers, producers, and director are too afraid of the controversial subject matter to provide a clear answer to the question it asks the audience. Instead of being thought provoking film, the movie deteriorates into another predictable by the numbers forgettable commercial Hollywood drama. If the studios gave me million dollars I could make a better film than this.  Indecent Proposal follows a struggling California married couple drowning$50,000 in debt. Out of work and desperate for cash, they go on a trip to Vegas. Browsing in a hotel store, Diana runs into a Billionaire John Gage who has eyes on her. He offers to buy her a $5000 dress she has eyes on. Diana says she can't be bought. Gage sees a challenge. Shawn sees a predictable plot twist. Thinking nothing of her encounter she returns to the gambling tables with her husband. After winning $25,000, Halfway towards their goal, the couple heads back to their room planning to gamble more unaware of how Hollywood casinos operate. Predictably they lose all their winnings. Both run into Gage who asks Diana to go to his table for luck. Gage plays a high stakes game betting a million dollars on a crap table. After winning his high stakes bet, Gage asks the couple to join him in his suite. There he proposes his indecent proposal: A night with the wife in exchange for a million dollars. The cash-strapped couple declines, but ponders taking him up on his offer on the way back to the hotel room. Set your watch for what happens next. Soon after the proposal the movie falls apart. Gage buys her the expensive dress sweetens the pot. Upon getting the dress the couple decides takes up Gage on his offer. With his wife on the way, Woody hangs out with a lawyer buddy. Soon after talking to him, Harrelson's character gets second thoughts. He races for the roof to cancel the deal but is too late to stop the helicopter. How predictable. On the boat we watch Diana getting ready. She and Gage meet up and have dinner and drinks. We don't know if they have relations; the movie leaves that as a mystery. Diana and her husband return to California to pay their debts. They soon find out John Gage has bought out their mortgage. Things start to get ridiculous from here. The manipulative Gage only bought the house as part of a tactic to possess Diana. He goes to her real estate job and tries to court her. I guess one night of her good stuff wasn't good enough for her. Harrelson's character starts to become insecure, wanting graphic details of the encounter. His jealousies cause him to act irrational and angry like every other movie husband. Feeling stressed out, Diana leaves her husband for the super rich Gage. Yawn. Losing his woman, Harrelson takes a teaching job and starts working on his future. Getting the divorce papers, he goes to an auction for animals. There he spends the one million dollars on a hippo to prove how much he loves her. He signs the divorce papers and she goes off with her billionaire man. He gets a change of heart when he realizes she still loves him. Yawn. Later in the car, Gage and his driver talk about how they've played this game over a dozen times. Diana requests he stop the car. They break up and she gets on a bus. Later she meets her ex-husband at the pier he proposed to her at and the movie comes to a clunky unsatisfying close. The performances are terrible. The entire cast is uninspired; no one in this film makes an effort to bring any type of depth to their characters. Woody Harrelson is horribly miscast. I don't believe him as an architecture expert. Demi Moore is wooden in the role of Diana. She brings no dimension to the character at all. I feel no tension or stress from her even though she's playing a woman conflicted by tremendous emotional and moral pressures. Robert Redford is charming and handsome, as John Gage but the character seems like a one-dimensional caricature instead of a human being. Look for Billy Bob Thornton in a small role as a tourist. Indecent Proposal isn't indecent it's just bland. It doesn't take any of the risks in its exploration of its taboo subject matter. Aside from some lukewarm sex scenes early on between the married couple, the movie is just another by the numbers Hollywood drama pretending to be a thought provoking film. The provocative ideas about sexual morals and ethics advertised in its premise are just a selling point to trick customers into spending money on it. Don't let this movie con you out of your hard earned cash. Instead of accepting this mediocre proposal on the video rack, I suggest you pick up Summer of '42, When Harry Met Sally or Love Story.+dvd
Complete butchering of a good story+N+I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.  Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.  I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply "everybody must die!".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.  Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.  I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence "revealing" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.  Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie+dvd
Belongs in every Pilates video library!!!+P+I don't usually write reviews but I feel compelled to spread the word; this workout is an excellent value.  I own many fitness and Pilates videos.  I have also used a Pilates Reformer with a personal trainer.  This DVD is the first workout I have seen that has someone actually perform the exercise on the reformer, then show the mat move.  The production quality is excellent and the cueing is right on target (and not in the least annoying).  If you have never tried Pilates mat work this DVD (or the beginner version) would be very helpful.

Stick with the original+N+When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?  I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.  But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.  Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?  I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.  by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito+dvd
Jim Carey's Genius Strikes Again!!+P+I love this re-telling of the classic Dr. Suess cartoon that everybody over 30 grew up with! Jim Carey was born to play this role and  Ron Howard's direction is superb, as well as all the supporting cast! Great story-telling that will last for  generations to come+dvd
Tour de Force for William Holden+P+This is movie is an excellent WWII prisoner of war film. I was enamored immediately and for the entire length of this film. William Holden is perfect as an American POW caught in the middle between a mission dreamed up by his British companions and desire to sit the war out. Director David Lean is the master.+dvd
Gumboostic!!!!+P+I bought this DVD sometime ago, but forgot about it until I discovered it just sitting there among my DVD collection. I watched it and bwoy! was I taken away or what? Being originally from Southern Africa brought back many memories as we used to grow up listening and mimicking Gumboot dancing. This is a must-see DVD and the dancing, choreography and music has been excently put together to bring this explosion of energy and power! Makes you feel like you are actually there...+dvd
Foot Stompin'+P+Words simply cannot describe what is contained on this DVD!  We bought the VHS version and played it every night for a week and just ordered the DVD tonight.

The Truth Will Set You Free+P+A wonderful movie about a boy whose family are coal miners in Ireland.  This young boy wants to dance instead of following him father and brother into the coal mines.  He rises above the ridicule of him family and friends and finds a mentor who helps him fulfill his dreams.  What I love so much about this story is that one realizes you don't have to follow the norm in order to be happy and succeed.  What we need to do is follow our hearts.  I loved this movie and I believe you will too+dvd
Poor at Best+N+I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys.  Currently "The Yards" and "Ghost World" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf.  I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it.  Slow story, not enough character development.  All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is+dvd

If you do not know this movie by heart, I'm gonna tear your eyeballs out and suck your skull!+P+Ten stars.  That simple.  Between a flawless performance by Douglas and the advisory/cameo role of Jeff Beck, this movie backfired on Stone.  Its brilliance is as much in its apparent insight into "80s greed" as it is inspiration for everyone who firmly believes that one Ferrari is simply not enough.  Virtually every line of this Oscar-winning masterpiece should be committed to memory, not for it purported value as a parable re: capitalism gone bad but as an arrow in one's quiver for daily conversation.  "I create nothing; I own.+dvd
Edited+N+I was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the TV version I had originally seen.  I didn't realize the DVD was being offered by a 'family values' group.  Although the original version was barely PG, the editied version is now definitively G.  Several lines of dialogue between the 2 main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed.  It's still a good movie and if you haven't seen the original, you probably won't care.  Personally, I dropped off the DVD at the Salvation Army and just kept my video-taped off the TV version - commercials and all.  For me, the interaction between the 2 main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $25 (with shipping), so losing that was a big disappointment for me.  For me, it was a waste of money.  If you have kids, though, it would probably be a good buy+dvd

Well, it could have been worse. Really.+N+Bay of Blood (Mario Bava, 1971)  It amuses me that Mario Bava himself hated this movie. The first thing I thought after it was over was "man, that was miles better than Black Sunday." It's still not worth rewatching, but if you've steered clear of Bava after watching the borefest that was Black Sunday, this may entice you to at least give him another try.  The plot, what little of it there is, is this; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake (the bay of the title). Her daughter stages a suicide, so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves. A bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident. Complications ensue.  It's hopelessly entangled in its own plot, despite that plot not being in any way complex. It throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity (but some, at least, courtesy the lovely softcore actress Brigitte Skay), foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come. Basically, it's mindless fun. Dario Argento did it far better a few years later with Profondo Rosso; see that instead. *+dvd
muddy+N+this sounds terrible. doesn't look too well either. the 2005 version is all one might need,it covers it all with passion and grace. time is fair+dvd
Enough with the Lions!+N+I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..+dvd
Not too hot+N+Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one+dvd
Not up to History Channel standard+N+Sorry to say this two-pack is not up to History Channel usual high standard. DVD 1, on the Spartans (essentially leading up to Thermopylae) is good. However, DVD 2 is very disappointing. First of all, it has three documentaires, but in fact the first one ("The Odyssey of Troy") and the third one ("The Trojan City") are carbon copies of each other, which is somewhat of a fraud... Second, the information given by the historians is good, but the narrative itself is more than misleading -- it leaves the viewer with the impression that the Trojan Horse epic is part of Homer's Iliad. It isn't. Homer finishes the Iliad with the burial of Hector. It is in a "sequel" so to say, by Quintus of Smyrna, written many centuries later, that the story of the Trojan Horse is set down. It is also mentioned in other less complete writings, but certainly not in Homer.  To be fair, the second documentary in DVD 2 ("The Ancient Gold of Troy") is not bad, but does not correct the errors in the other "two" segements+dvd
In Search of the Castaways+P+If you're a Hayley Mills fan and a child of the 60s and 70s, then you will love this movie. It has great action, comedy, and sweet romance. +dvd
Oscar Wilde Lite+N+As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach.  The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.  I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.  If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated+dvd
Tauhidul Hoque+P+These are the 9 season bundled together, so plan on buying 2 more sets later. Good deal at $99+dvd
One of my favorite movies of all time+P+And it's a very personal choice. I can totally understand the reviewers who said "Huh?" because it's just that kind of a movie. You either get it or you don't, as the one featured reviewer pointed out (a reviewer whose review I was quite amused to see, as I agree with every word of it, and that probably will never happen again). Yes, the acting is overdone (or "stylized," if you're one of the people enamored of this film). The plot is implausible and absurd (or "fantasy-like and surreal"). The musical choices are a bizarre hodge-podge (or "brilliantly eclectic"). About the only thing there could be no argument about is Ms Lane: you know how good she looks now? Imagine what she looked like in 1984 in a red and black leather mini-dress. I think my feelings are best summed up by the monologue of Raven in this 1984 box-office bomb that I've seen more times than any other film besides Escape from New York: "You're making this harder than it has to be. You and me fall in love for a week or two. I let you go. No one gets hurt." That's what you do with this film for 90 minutes. And with DVD technology, able to skip the slow parts, you can get this down to about 45 minutes of nearly rapturous bliss.+dvd
The teacher we all wanted, or wanted to be...+P+I have always had a soft spot in my heart for this film and its cast. Itself an imitator of earlier movies, such as "Blackboard Jungle" in which Sidney was a student, not the teacher, it has had dozens if not scores of would-be successors as "the" flick about unorthodox teachers saving troubled students. However, I can't think of any which have come after that I wanted to see twice---not "Up the Down Staircase" or "Dangerous Minds" or the one about the calculus teacher or the one about Principal Joe Clark or the one with Jim Belushi or the one with Tom Berenger as the substitute or even the recent one with Hillary Swank, which was pretty good once it got going. "To Sir With Love" is the standout in a very large group. It had cast chemistry and charm and sweetness and an offbeat innocence. And we still need "life skills" classes as mandatory offerings in American high schools, an idea that this film was, I believe, the first to champion, despite its being set in Great Britain+dvd
Review of Arthur's Lost Library Book+P+I recommend this DVD for family viewing to everyone.  My kids, ranging from 5 years old to 14 years old, still enjoy watching the series.  Since there is not much of a selection for family viewing on our local stations, we decided to create a DVD library.  This was one voted by the kids as well as the parents to have.  The three episodes included in this DVD edition are: (1) Arthur's Lost library book-about Arthur losing the latest Scare-Your-Pants-Off book from the library; (2) D.W.'s Imaginary Friend-D.W.'s new imaginary friend, Nadine, moves into the house and follows D.W everywhere, even to the Amuzement Park, much to Arthur's dislike; (3) D.W.'s Libary Card-about D.W. getting her first library card. +dvd
Apples and Oranges+P+Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us.  THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.  Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background.  One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving!  Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members.  Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living.  The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of  Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending.  All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different.  Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp, January 0+dvd
Not really+N+VP1 was an astonishingly good representation of the impact of the 1960's on the next decade...it had a great car and a good cast; great soundtrack and good scenery as well as a "feel" for what a lot of the USA and its inhabitants were like (low budget so it used a lot of real people and locales). Kowalski had tried the straight and narrow and then the crooked and lowdown. He had failed (not always his fault and did have some successes...medal of honor ,e.g.)at each...had suffered the loss of his love,so, all that was left was death. VP2 has the Dodge Challenger R/T and a vapid, inane plot. What a waste of a great repro/rebuilt classic muscle car! Get VP1 and see if,even after 35 years, it does not hold up... +dvd
Fun family film+P+This movie is one of my kids' favorites. In fact, it was the first live-action movie my older daughter could sit through, probably because it's pretty cartoonish live-action. The nice thing is that grownups can stand to watch it, too. It's very silly, of course, but there are lots of funny gags, many of which go right over the heads of children. There's a little bathroom humor, but what else would you expect in a movie with talking gorillas and an elephant that plays fetch? Best of all, from my point of view, is the fact that perfectly-cast Brendan Fraser spends a good portion of the movie wearing only a loincloth.  I agree with other reviewers, however, that it would be nice if the DVD were in widescreen and came with some extras. But I'll settle for 90 minutes of happy children plus Brendan Fraser in a loincloth+dvd
Triple-Feature Delight!+P+The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of my favorite stories, and this DVD contains two excellent film versions-- three, if one counts the Bugs Bunny Jekyll-Hyde animated short, which is definitely a bonus!  The Audio Commentary is also an excellent feature, as it delivers a lot of fascinating information regarding both versions featured on this DVD as well as the John Barrymore version from the 1920's.  Now for the main features:  The 1930's version with Fredric March is highly entertaining, and although it certainly fits the mold of a "creature feature," it carries with it an intelligence that distinguishes it from a typical monster flick.  Fredric March himself is excellent in the dual role of the saint-like (and eventually tortured) Dr. Jekyll and the initially humorous, but ultimately horrifically sadistic Mr. Hyde.  The ape-like Hyde make-up in this film is excellent, especially for its time, but the transformation sequence is even more impressive, as it is done fairly realistically.  Also, the film sticks to the basic storyline, and the use of the fiance/dancer dichotomy adds an interesting twist to the "strange case."  This is a must-see for all fans of horror movies, especially those who enjoy classic horror films.  The 1940's version of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde with Spencer Tracy is also a highly entertaining and excellent film.  There are those who do not consider this a horror film-- I would have to disagree with them completely.  Although this film is a rather lush production of the Jekyll/Hyde story, Spencer Tracy's Hyde ends up being rather horrific in his character, all because of an effective portrayal by a more-than-capable actor.  He (Tracy) manages to add a more humorous touch to both personalities (Jekyll and Hyde), and his Jekyll seems genuinely exhausted from the numerous misdeeds of his alter ego.  As for the Hyde make-up, it is considerably more human-looking than the Fredric March version, but this does not make it any less effective.  In keeping with the tradition of the 1930's version, Tracy's Hyde begins as a somewhat more brutish-looking man who bears relatively little resemblance to the actor, but gets increasingly hideous as the film progresses; as his deeds get worse and worse, this Mr. Hyde becomes exactly what he's meant to be: a monster, both in character and appearance.  True, Mr. Hyde may not be a typical role for actor Spencer Tracy, but his excellent performance shows that he is far from miscast.  Also, this version follows the basic story format as well, which qualifies it as a good adaptation of the original story.  This DVD is an excellent buy, and any purchaser will definitely get more bang for his or her buck!+dvd
D-TV... +N+No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...          +dvd
Ghostbusters I & II (Double Feature Giftset)+P+My son ask for this for Christmas (He's 17). He has watched these movies too many times to count. He can quote lines and he knows all the songs. I would rather my 17 year old watch these movies than some of the other movies out these+dvd
Sweet!+P+This is a beautiful, sensitive film that addresses issues both spritual and secular, and it manages to do it all with amazing humor! It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again and share with friends and family+dvd
A fun movie+P+There are far too few movies that are made just for fun these days. Down Periscope is proof that you don't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie. My teenagers loved it, setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers.  Kelsey Grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role, playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie. Known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub (an old rusty diesel boat) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern Navy. Fortunately Grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone.   The crew consists of stereotypes, from the flatulant cook, to the grizzled old veteran, to the spoiled son of an admiral, to the basketball star, to the spit-and-polish XO, but the actors manage to bring them off with charm, especially the electrician who Grammer notes has "absorbed a lot of voltage". In addition to the big laughs, there are the little scenes that bring a smile, such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to "see if the other rooms are still tilted"  Ultimately it is a feel-good movie. It doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts, but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch!  Of special note, San Franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the "mothball fleet" in Suisun Bay and the docked sub shots of the "Stingray" are the USS Pampanito, a sub open for tours at Pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end.+dvd
Good kids movie+P+My daughter loes this movie. She wasn't a big watcher of Jimmy before this, but now just wants to see it over and over+dvd
Ninja Flick from the Writer of 'Pretty Woman' (I'm Not Kidding): Poor Actions And Laughable Story +N+Not to be confused with `The Hunted' (2003) directed by William Friedkin.  `The Hunted' (1995) stars French actor Christopher Lambert as Paul Racine, American businessman on trip to modern-day Nagoya, third-largest city of Japan, who happens to witness the killing of a woman by black-masked ninjas. The cult ninja group is actually led by a charismatic leader, Japanese named `Kinjo' who is played by a Chinese actor John Lone, and they begin to search Paul to kill. At the end of the film Paul, an ordinary businessman, proves to be an equal match when fighting against martial arts master Kinjo with a Japanese sword. If you can believe this ridiculous story, you can believe anything.  I can happily ignore all the cultural inaccuracy in films as long as they give me something entertaining, but unfortunately it was not the case with `The Hunted,' of which story slowly follows a beaten path of the genre to the unexciting climax. Moreover, to handle a Japanese sword you need certain kind of gracefulness, which Tom Cruise in `The Last Samurai' managed to acquire after many months' hard training. Lambert et al. show no such thing. He and other ninjas just use them fast and furious, but with no grace and consequently, impact at all. Instead the film substituted the grace of Japanese sword fighting for needless bloody violence, and its pinnacle is the pointless terrorism of the ninjas in the bullet train. This is an insult to Japanese culture, for a ninja could be a spy or an assassin, but he is never a terrorist who would kill innocent passengers.  But the most damaging is the way how the film treats women, who are there to be used for sex scenes. Watching Joan Chen in a Japanese bathtub with Christopher Lambert was something I never expected to see, and it surely represents the attitudes of some (if not all) Hollywood films towards women. And it is not surprising to see the film's director is J. F. Lawton, whose biggest hit is Julia Roberts' `Pretty Woman' (as a writer).  By some distributors (who must have been shocked to know the film's awful content after buying the right) really released this Universal film theatrically in Japan. Since then it has been a cult film for avid Japanese film fans, who take this film as sort of comedy. Really. In addition to the ridiculous casting and the laughable scene where Chris and Joan make love in Japanese bathtub that looks as if made 200 years ago, it has plenty of things that make us laugh - a sweet little girl in pachinko parlor, a kind of gambling place (What is she doing there?); a flight attendant-like female assassin in the bullet train (Come on, it's a train, not an airplane!), and the banging Japanese taiko (drum) concert in the garden of a Nagoya hotel (You just cannot sleep!). Even though this is an action flick, it needs some degree of plausibility, which it totally disregards. And there are poorly done actions, which is another reason that makes me regard `The Hunted' as the Universal Pictures have temporarily stepped into the Ed Wood's Grade-Z territory+dvd
Friday Night Lights+P+Where I come from high school sports in general was something merely for the jocks to participate in and rarely garnered any widespread interest within the school.  Football games--except for the annual "bowl" game against our cross-town rival (eventually discontinued because of the traditional post-game brawl)--rarely found more than one hundred parents and students attending.  So some of the meaning behind this film is I guess lost, leaving me more of a dispassionate observer than anything else.  Still, I really found this movie to be quite fascinating, and a powerful and well-told story.      +dvd
powerful teen drama+P+I loved this movie from the moment I saw it for sale at my video store's discard rack ten years ago. I recently received the DVD as a gift and the sound quality is a big improvement over my old vhs copy.  I recommend it for performances, the story and the photography. Jodie Foster's monologue toward the end of the film is particularly memorable. Each girl's story line is realistic and the film itself does a good job of capturing teen life in the late 70s before yuppie values took hold.  This is NOT a John Hughes film and is a refreshing change for anyone who was subjected that director's teen films in the 80s+dvd
ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!+N+I actually caught this crapfest on the Sci-Fi channel the other night. That's exactly what it was, a crapfest. I didn't even know I was looking at Nick Carter until I read some of these reviews, which I consider a blessing. No wonder that family has so many problems. And such veteran actors such as Judge Reinhold and Stacy Keach must have been really desperate for cash if they committed to this schlock. And don't even get me started on the headless horseman. He was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy 50's science fiction movie. If you want to see the best version of the story, watch Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. If you want originality, either watch Ichabod and Mr. Toad or read the original story+dvd
Mediocre DVD Transfer; Average Sci-Fi Movie+N+For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.    For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.  There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.  My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama+dvd
Two problems about this dvd+N+I give it one star for the dvd. I give the movie 5 stars or more if I could. Starting out is, everyone who is a die hard fan of this movie knows this is suppose to be a widescreen motion picture. hell even on TNT high definition tv, they aired it in the right aspect so I had to tape it because ive never got to see it in its actual aspect. Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this. Well I know people are going to say, READ THE BOOK DUMMY and you will know. Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic. One of those kinds that you could just sit there and feel that everything on the show was really actually happening and not just acting. That is a good movie! One last thing. Dont go buying this peice of junk dvd. wait until warner releases the true format and maybe some extra features to go along. THey did it with the classic. Lost boy+dvd
terrible+N+I thought it was boring.I didnt like the concept of it was too jewish. I didnt like they made jews too strict. I didnt like the way they made the customs. I didnt like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions. For example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath. I could understand it because i am an orthdox jew. because i have gone to yeshiva. Most non jewish pepole  cant understand the movie. As well as non orthdox jews.Boaz yakin had no right makin the movie like this. he should make a sequel to learn from his mistakes to make it a public movie. I wish i were in  show business to make the movie more normal+dvd
The clash of two cultures!+P+Kaufman's adaptation of Michael Crichton's Japan-bashing potboiler is a realtively light approach, a simple buddy-cop movie featuring a pair of entertaining star performances. In spite of the fact the novel's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant Japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between Eastern and Western worlds around a lot of issues, the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal, transforming it into an interesting film, whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures, with Sean Connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations. Yet Sean Connery makes a very credible performance, as the detective, the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys, and the ominous presence of the Japanese mob with pretensions of Noir Film, the picture leaves us a bitter taste, because even if there are good sequences, the whole material promised best best and major intentions.     +dvd
Great Movie+P+I was told to watch this film my a college professor many years ago and has since became one of my favorite films. I highly advice this movie for anyone interested in apartide issues+dvd
A Thriller to the End+P+This is Rob Lowe's best work. It shows just how talented an actor he is. All of the acting is superb. John Glover is dispicable, but good. The sailing photography is gorgeous. The sailing lingo is right on. It's a twisting movie that keeps one guessing until the very end. Now, if we could only get it in DVD with outtakes. When is the studio going to wake up+dvd
Another great Dora video!+P+My son loves this! We are accumulating the Dora DVDs one at a time because I get tired of hearing the same ones over and over... But I must say that Dora is just about the only one that doesn't get on my nerves. I even catch myself WATCHING her from time to time.  This has some movement for the kids to participate in, some learning, and fun songs. An all around great DVD for the little ones.+dvd
Never!+N+The last song in it was not written by Rodgers and Hart.  It was I think written by Roger Edens (of Judy Garland fame?), and is a mediocre imitation of Hartesque rhymes, at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start.  Several of the songs from the stage show were left out, as were all the verses.  Extra lyrics (not by Hart) were added to "The Most Beautiful Girl In The World" for Durante to sing and Martha's Raye's "The Circus Is On Parade."  Songs from other R&H shows were interpolated.  Did someone high up like god know better than R&H what songs should be in a R&H show?  Finally, and absolutely humiliating for Martha Raye and I suspect Doris Day had a hand in it but maybe not, the line sung by Doris "Two feet are ever cold" is followed by Martha Raye with "Four feet are never cold" which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered "I only mean to imply" by Raye.  Goodness.  She said something wrong.  I am beginning to dislike Doris Day intensely.  She disgusts me.  The title of this shocking little song is "Why Can't I?" also not from the original show and with much excised.  The story (such as it is) is a predictable drag.  The DVD is cheap on Amazon (until you add postage), it's a flat $20 everywhere else + tax.  If you must, buy it from Amazon.  I wouldn't take it for free.  This is truly wholesome family entertainment, and that's about as nauseous a recommendation as I can give it.  If you like Rodgers and Hart, forget it.  Durante was in the original on stage.  I gave it 2 stars for the pretty tunes (and almost Roger Edens').  +dvd
Very frustrated with fake accents!!+N+As an avid Agatha Christie fan, I was thrilled to receive this movie as a gift for my birthday.  I had watched the two other movies staring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot and absolutely LOVED them!! However, I was so bored and frustrated throughout this movie.  Albert Finney was a terrible Poirot.  I honestly could barely understand a word he and some of the other actors were saying.  The accents were barely comprehendable.  I had to play and replay the end where the mystery is solved.  I am very upset my husband spent the money on buying this movie as I am sure that I will never be able to sit through it again.  The plot was great, however, some of the acting was horrid.  I am only giving it two stars because it is based on an Agatha Christie novel.  Based on the film itself; no stars. If you can understand even half of what Albert Finney is saying, you're a better woman than I+dvd
Vintage Crosby+P+At the height of his wartime fame, Bing Crosby plays a hip young Catholic priest who arrives to help a troubled parish struggle back to its feet.  Of course, what passed for young and hip back then, in this lily white, family-friendly comedy-drama may seem pretty silly these days -- Bing is convincing, though, as he use his suave social skills to listen to and help out those in need.  Veteran scene-stealer Barry Fitzgerald plays the doddering, crusty old Irish priest who runs the church before Crosby's arrival... The rest of the supporting cast isn't as strong, but the film still has its charms. Mostly it's just a great chance to observe Crosby at his most magnetic and self-assured.  The film also previewed hits like &quot;Swinging On A Star&quot; and Bing's version of &quot;Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra,&quot; both of which are longtime favorites+dvd
disappointed+N+We do not think this video is worth purchasing.  After receiving it and viewing it we were disappointed in its storyline and also the quality of the tape itself. I didn't think I would find a Tom Selleck movie I wouldn't want to watch but this is the one+dvd
Mediocre At Best+N+If you're expecting the same power and intensity of "Scooby Doo On Zombie Island" or "Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost," then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment. It is possible that certain powers felt that the first 2 Scooby movies were too much for children, but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact, suspense, character development, and even mystery. It may be true that even a medocre Scooby movie is better than no Scooby movie at all, but this movie is almost boring after "Zombie Island" or "Witch's Ghost." Well, Scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert. Fred, Daphne, and Velmah go on foot for help while Scooby and Shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion. With their famous and hilarious cowardly ways, they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. At the restaurant, the gang is surprised that the other patrons don't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens. We also meet Lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area. Lester lets the gang stay the night, and Scooby and Shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens.' Moving on, Scooby and Shaggy meet Amber and Crystal, and are attracted to them. They later meet the mechanic Buck as well as a team of scientists (that we already have met). Unlike "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," the misleads are not really well drawn. Also, rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains, we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious. Even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story (in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything) it's nothing most people couldn't have figured out. I won't deny that there are some good moments in this movie. (For undoubtedly the first time, Scooby and Shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing!)  But even the old episodes were usually better than this movie. Parents may not have to screen this movie, but it is  likely that even children will fall asleep during this one. Thank goodness for the eventual "Legend of the Vampire" and "Aloha Scooby Doo."+dvd
Ridiculous but entertaining+P+This movie followed its cover synopsis to the letter.  Lots of hot young Asian ladies doing martial arts.   Actually, the techniques are so ridiculously gracious that they are great to watch.  Where else do you see cinematic application of Wushu moves, which are martial arts gymnastics cultured entirely away from combat application.  I guess that's what makes the ridiculous so enjoyable to watch.  You see the typical long fist and other wushu moves performed beautifully .  I'm writing this paragraph due to the other somewhat negative views on the rape scene.  After watching the girls culled by training over years (a few drowned youngsters are even pulled from the surf), killed in testing by guards, culled again to half in the open dormitory scene in which each girl must kill another to leave the building, culled yet again to three in weaponed combat, and lots of males, guards and targets, killed by assassins, some reviewers think that a rape scene is just too darn much.  That's a reflection of our modern society of the disposable male and protected female - all under the guise of gender equality.   Apparently, it's now socially acceptible to kill as many men as you want, especially on assassin assignment.  This movie has at least two scenes killing a naked man during a massage.  Well, I suppose modern social trends on gender-specific violence will be driving future legislation.    +dvd
A Drop of Water+P+I remember seeing this short film as a young child and it scared me so much that now as an adult lover of horror films seeked to purchase it for my family. I am not one who scares easily and this film was frightening. I loved watching it with my husband, because it was so much fun to see him jump during the movie! I totally recommend renting/purchasing this from the Black Sabboth trilogy collection. Happy haunting!  Pam from Eagle Mountain Lake, Texa+dvd
Revolting+N+This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous+dvd
At long last+P+Good to see this finally released on DVD as I had worn out my VHS copy. One of the great music videos, this is a must have for all Nirvana fans. The quality is not the best, but that being a result of the source equipment, not the video to DVD transfer. Hopefully, this copy will last forever+dvd
Stay away from that monkey+N+Okay, I've discovered the Worst Director Ever, bar none.  I've watched three of Hollywood b-movie veteran director Jean Yarbrough  recently (THE BRUTE MAN, THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG, and now HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE) and this is one bad-nasty awful director.  OTHG was a criminal waste of a veteran cast of character actors heading rapidly towards the sunset.  BRUTE MAN was exploitation unleavened with insight or humanity.  HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE is hick humor for those who find Don Knotts' movies too difficult to follow.  These films are monuments to blown opportunities, stagnant and unimaginative direction, comedy that makes us groan and horror that makes us laugh.     Avoid the scenes with Basil Rathbone if at all possible.  It's apparent he'd suffered a stroke prior to this movie and his distinct enunciation is noticeably slurred, making it difficult for a fan to watch.  About the only highlights here are when the country music stars (Ferlin Husky and Merle Haggard, especially) strap on the guitars and sing.+dvd
A competitor to the stage show version.......+P+Recently my husband, daughter and I went to NYC to see the Broadway version of the POTO. The show was outstanding and a pleasure to see on stage, but I have read many reviews that criticize this newest film adaptation. I strongly disagree! This special addition DVD delighted my entire family. I am very impressed with this movie version and highly reccommend it. Its depiction of the POTO story is evocatively romantic and the music is a "perfect" score. The special additions reveal just what lengths Andrew Lloyd Webber, director Joel Schumacher and their  collaborators went through to finally achieve this production. It also contains the evolution of the POTO stage show as well as the movie. Gerard Butler is the ultimate Phantom and I was enchanted with his singing.  If you love captivating music and romantic movies - buy this DVD+dvd
A tour de force of great actors+P+The cast alone makes this one of the great films of all time.   The acting is superb, the characters are portrayed as likeable and keep you cheering for their cause.   It is, perhaps, Steve McQueen's greatest film right up to and including the best motorcycle footage ever at the end.  Charles Bronson is never better.  The action/drama is intense and builds quickly to a brilliant and moving finish.  Every movie affecionado will want this one for the memorable characters. +dvd
Ugh. Doesn't deserve Stitch's name!+N+Wow, this movie was awful.  I am a HUGE fan of "Lilo & Stitch" so naturally I bought this movie sight unseen.  Looks like Disney is just cashing the sequel checks with children being their primary target.  Very low quality story. Stick with Saturday morning cartoons -- at least they're free+dvd
Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining+N+Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so+dvd
Better than expected+P+After reading some of the more negative reviews, I thought that this movie would be a dud, but it was not.  I found it to be interesting, although a bit predictable.  As a historical drama it brings to light a story of which many may be unaware - the murder of a low level movie producer by a publishing magnate.  Good plot, good acting, good story telling and plausible ending make this movie enjoyable+dvd
Witty Light Romantic Fare+P+Taken for what it intends, this a great film.  Formulaic? Yes, but it's a formula done well.  Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe demonstrate that light-hearted romantic stories do not require a gut-wrenching tragedy or rivalry to propel a plot.  Pour yourself a glass of red wine (the good stuff) and relax as you enjoy charming characters in breathtaking scenery.  A good vacation from reality for a couple of bucks at your local vdeo store+dvd
No, thanks.+N+I will not be buying this version. I have no desire to have a cherished Christmas classic with it's cover despoiled by an obnoxious picture of an obnoxious "musician".  I will keep searching pre-owned DVD outlets for the previous DVD release of this, the one which hasn't been defaced by an ill-concieved marketing gimmick.  What were they thinking? The people who don't care would have bought this either way, but they've lost those of us who do care. Seems to me like a counter-productive strategy. The people at Sony who made this decision should be fired+dvd
When Night is Falling+P+This is a powerful down to earth movie, It is very well done. The actors, script , storyline,,,is totally awesome. It is a must sse for,,not just the alternative lifestyle communities.   Jenn+dvd
magical+P+I love this film. It's up there with my favourites. It has an air of mystery and sensuality that it pulls off very well. I loved the storyline, the Sirkus of Sorts, the funny quotes added in. A favourite "romantic/lovestory" movie+dvd
Wonderful price for what you get+P+This set is absolutely great!  My children love this and watch it over and over again. Is a must have for any child that loves Dora, Blues Clues, Little Bill, and The Backyardigans.  Wonderful gift idea hours of fun+dvd
You Just Got Your Asses Whipped by a Bunch of Goddamn Nerds!+P+John Goodman is king. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Dirty, raunchy, and completely unsuitable for teenage viewing, this movie makes it fun to remember what it was like when comedies actually contained full frontal female nudity! The locker room speech by John Goodman is one of the funniest things I have ever heard. BUY THIS MOVIE NOW! P.S. "What is hairpie?" or "Step Aside Mama, I Wanna See Some of That Muff".+dvd
I love christian bale+P+I'm Korean.. So...My English is not very good... What I really want to say is..... christian bale is a good player.. I love christian bale.+dvd
All in all, pretty good+P+All the Little Animals follows the off-kilter adventures of Bobby Platt (Christian Bale), a young man who's been left a simpleton by the long-ago car accident that damaged his brain but not his soul. He wholeheartedly loves animals and he's got a pet mouse named Peter, but Bobby has to keep Peter hidden from his wicked stepfather, De Winter (Daniel Benzali). Unable to handle De Winter's abuse any longer Bobby runs away, hitchhiking from London to Cornwall, where he meets Mr. Summers (John Hurt). Summers is a quiet man who's devoted his life to giving dead animals a reverent burial, and he trains Bobby to follow in his footsteps.   Even though the movie's title is All the Little Animals, there aren't any developed animal characters. Peter is cute, but he's out of the picture pretty quick. The rest are corpses, or depicted in wistful dream sequences (the fox is a fixture, and there's also an otter, a horse and a beaver). The human characters are sort of one-dimensional - particularly The Fat - but the actors are all superb. Benzali and Hurt's reputations precede them, but Bale is very underrated. That may change when his high-profile role of Batman hits the big screen, but as of now the general public doesn't know him. He's an actor of great range, proven by his equally convincing portrayals of simple and sweet Bobby Platt in All the Little Animals and diabolical, murderous Patrick Bateman in American Psycho shortly after.

Short, but you get the main points+P+Short enought to watch it, learn the key points. You will need the book however, to see more examples and better understanding. Perfect complementary to the book ( without book not as useful)+dvd
One of the worst adaptations ever made.+N+Sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition, but it's not even the butchering that's the problem. The problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book. Jan de Bont decided to take the atmospheric Haunting of Hill House and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting. DePalma went and decided to tone down the racism in Bonfire of the Vanities. But those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to Shlessinger's choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop.  From the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with Faye sighing at Tod's stupid rose, this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad. Even if there wasn't a great book to be killing, this would be a terrible movie. But with Day of the Locust as a source material, the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal. One imagines the book done right by a Quentin Tarantino or a Todd Solondz.  Where the book is fast, the movie is slow. Tod Hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but Shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role. The casting choice is decidedly better with Donald Sutherland as Homer Simpson, but Sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through. Every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of Faye goes on forever.  The riot scene that ends the movie becomes a Night of the Living Dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on. Furthermore, the key sequence of the book (Tod imitating the police sirens) gets lost and Tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something.  This is a terrible movie. The original book deserves much better+dvd
Hollywood Apocalypse... Sorta+N+It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.  As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that "Day of the Locust" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.  "Locust" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.  But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.  It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in "An Englishman Abroad". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.  It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...  Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, "Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot.   To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a "symbolic" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours.   Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before "Miss Lonelyhearts" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after "Locust" appeared. Then they went and made this movie. Remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair.+dvd
I'm confused....+N+I saw this movie in the theater and still don't really know what it's actually about. I have to say though, that if you rank this "film" as a comedy, then it deserves 5 stars, sadly, I'm pretty certain that Uwe Boll didn't mean it as such (though i'm sure he would say otherwise). Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  "don't be insane!" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell "polo" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction+dvd
uwe boll fails at life+N+Have you ever been stabbed in the face? I haven't but while I was watching this movie, I had this almost overbearing curiosity to find out what its like. Seriously, this movie is so bad, suicide won't erase the haunting visions of sheer ineptetude from your mind. this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. well, there are worse movies out there, shatter dead and 13 seconds being two that i can name off the top of my head, but i mean come on both movies had a combined budget of a McChicken sandwhich with a small order of fries. whats this movies excuse+dvd
Thank you Lord!!+P+Man, I wore out the Season 1 collection, and all I could think about was when was Season 2 coming out! Please bring Season 3 out before Christmas; believe me, we will snatch them all up+dvd
kitsch is global+N+A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as "well-worn," which seems to be a euphemism for "shop-worn," "clichï¿½," or "stupefyingly unoriginal." Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: "As It Is In Heaven" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the kï¿½ttbullar?)   A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:  -- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;  -- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;  -- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;  -- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is "Best Boy," a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in "There's Something About Mary," or turned into plaster saints as here.)   So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of "The O.C."  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-ï¿½-vis the USA: kitsch is global.+dvd
Chapellle didnt want to do these for a reason...+N+They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone.   Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though+dvd
Enough of too much awready!+N+The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7 million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the Guinness Book of Records for "most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture."  Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions. Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the idea.  There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next, and it became painfully repetitious.   Personally I would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled. There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire+dvd
The Trinity Collection+N+The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered.  It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD.  If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality+dvd
It's about kids at a "musical camp" for wannabe performers+N+These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem.   There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people. +dvd
terrible baby video+N+I cannot believe this is billed as a baby video.  The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby.+dvd
Predictable but Zooey saves the day+N+With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained. Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie+dvd
Not what I was expecting+N+If you are looking for a dvd that is filled with White Stripes music and interviews, look elsewhere.  The item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews, but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes (if that) of this is actually with the band (and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd).  It has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning.  It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again.  (If Jack & Meg were telling their own story, THAT would be worth it)+dvd
Embarrassing+N+I didn't even want to see this movie, but my brother read the book and wanted to see it.  (We were unaware of the fact that this wasn't meant to follow the book...)  Everything was poorly done in this movie.  Even Hans Zimmer's score didn't save it.  I've mentioned that I'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars, and if I could, I'd give it negative ten+dvd
The Big Sleep+N+Here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made! I couldn't believe what I was watching! Moreover,I am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating. What is going on? Is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about? Am I naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain? Where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work,hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema's most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor Ralph Fiennes? How I long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain.Sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as "The Constant Gardener" it appears that we unfortunate "real" film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future.+dvd
Will  the real Herzog please emerge.+N+This was so messy and Mr. Dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion. YUK.!..my partner and I were disgusted. He and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-Degenerates for sure.Too damn bad for your buddy. It was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of Herzogs past films. We have been fans for 20+ years. Looks like he did it for the money and Dorrington rode Herzogs coatails in  a way. Geez..I had just watched March of the Penguins and Wings of Migration and those! are truly documentaries made by film experts. The babbling and rambling on in The White Diamond made me pity Herzog. He did it for the $ maybe.Dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way I suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts. Hey Dorrington-Who cares about you? Herzog..Get out of California before you rot+dvd
Not Funny+N+I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all+dvd
Very Poor Quality DVD+N+Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one+dvd

This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot+N+This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called "Look Out, Officer" that Stephen Chow made in 1990. Shaolin Idiot is not out yet to my knowledge. If you want Stephen Chow's "Look Out, Officer" you should buy this DVD if not, don't.+dvd
What a complete waste of time+N+To say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego.  The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew.  This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects.   Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything to rent it. I won't be watching another Kevin Smith movie anytime soon+dvd
Pro-Apartheid propaganda produced by Jack Abramoff.  Yes, that Jack Abramoff!+N+Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a generation. Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council "Monkeys" and "troglodytes", had an interesting earlier career.    He was disqualified from the student government election in  his Beverly Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits. He took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and longtime republican insider Grover Norquist.    But more relevant to this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality.  During this period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority Afrikkaner government. The hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune, as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid.  An amazing historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america, and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line.  My advice, buy it used for historical purposes, not new.  This guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the American people.   Let's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style abuses of civil rights,  and many other crimes against humanity.  Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the USA.  Let this movie be a record of the power of Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth.  Let's make a different legacy this time around+dvd
For The Hardcore 50 Cent Fans Only (2 Stars)+N+I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL.  It wasn't all that entertaining.  The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know.  We've seen all these videos before, but the video for &quot;Heat&quot; is straight wack.  The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny.  The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said.  The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer?  The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad.  These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the &quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)&quot; ever since I lost my underground CD.  Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release.  If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release.  Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses.  The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already.  I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans+dvd
Worst action movie ever+N+Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says "Family-Friendly" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now+dvd
American Bob+N+I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?+dvd
Poorly Produced DVD+N+This is a review of the DVD, not the World Series.  Please save your comments re the Series for the sports blogs.  In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic.  This DVD was made for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the full widescreen.  It has black bars on all four sides.  They may as well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio.    Also, in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly, they decided not to include footage from the season, to show nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players.  ("Gee, was it exciting to be out on the mound!")  I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it.  Major League Baseball, as usual, cheats its fans.  Another lesson they fail to learn from Pro Football+dvd
What happened?+N+After seeing Match Point, which I loved, I figured I had to see Scoop. All I can say is "Oh my GAWD!" Scoop is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Woody Allen really should stay out of his own movies. And the rest of it, the story, acting, editing etc, were just painful to watch.      I can't believe he went from Match Point to this dribble+dvd
worst Bond movie?+N+Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable.  What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . .  (1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here. (2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate. (3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances. (4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of "Thunderball," of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled. (5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the "new" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either. (6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there.   All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of "Casino Royale" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion+dvd
Funny Premise - Unfunny Film+N+I was very disappointed with this film. The premise was really intriguing, with Elvis switching places with an Elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at Graceland leaving the real Elvis to scratch out a living as - what else - an Elvis "impersonator." And now, at the end of The King's life, he's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy. Since it's Texas, the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to Stevie Ray Vaughn. And oh, yeah, JFK is also in this nursing home, having inexplicably been transformed into Ozzie Davis.  How can you miss with a setup like this? Well, for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there's no real need to provide any additional comedy. The movie is flat, with very little humor. As other reviewers have noted, it moves at a glacial pace, even allowing for the protagonists being 80-somethings who don't move like they used to.  Sure, the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film, but there's no point in making a comdey that isn't funny.  Nice try, but booooooooooring. Not at all recommended. +dvd
Argento fans should avoid this unless completists+N+Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films.  Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary, dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances.  Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria never made films without Argento that are better than this..+dvd
Whip Me Til I'm Dead- A Real Bore+N+I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest.   There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!"   So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.  +dvd
Pretty Bad+N+I am a Howard Stern fanatic and a softball fanantic. I couldn't go wrong with this movie, right? Wrong! It is pretty bad. I was disappointed with Artie's project. Gross jokes terrible acting. There are a couple of funny scenes. Wait until it is on sale+dvd
Another teen slasher+N+So what kind of movie is this from the director of "I know what you did last summer?" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichéd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending.   So is it worth seeing?   That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply "an unstoppable evil force."  But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no.  Let's take a look at some of them;  Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo.   Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful.   Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween "stage blood" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film.   The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players.  So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production.   My recommendation?   It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again...+dvd
Beautiful, but overrated+N+This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.    Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.    The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end.  I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.   I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign.  So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. +dvd
Good suspense bad story+N+In this film made in UK and Luxembourg, Madeline Stowe stars as Senga. Senga and her daughter Nat are driving at midnight after visiting Nat's father. They bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop. Nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult. And we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter.  Both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood. Why they do so is never explained. And even at this point when Senga is trying to rescue Nat, she still acts like a brat. The last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion. And becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating I assigned.  That good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction, not the wirtting. The movie is dark and suspenseful. Though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie, it does keep you on the edge of the seat as Senga tries to rescue her daughter+dvd
Hard to Review+N+I would love to provide a review of this DVD, however since I've not received it, despite having placed my order in August (it's now November)and having written to Amazon Customer Service about the matter (as yet unanswered) I'm afraid any review will have to wait+dvd
Does He Ever Wear a Different Coat?+N+What's wrong with this show?  1.  Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series.       2.  A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums.    3.  Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her?  4.  Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car?  5.  Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
just another dumb preppie vs. nerd movie+N+This movie has been done over and over again, with different actors and by different directors, but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring.  Don't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind.... buy something original or save your money+dvd
There's a big difference between nudity and quality nudity.+N+If the girls in this film were considered "hot" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool.  Some unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie.  The goal of the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house, so they throw "wild" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless, etc.  The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old, which isn't a bad thing.  I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice.  Unfortunately I didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive.  If this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales.  I also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots.  How rude+dvd
Where is the Wolf?  Just Horrendous!+N+With the New Year just more than six hours away, I must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon, quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the flick "Darkwolf" for many moons to come.  What a joke.  What a silly, stupid, insult to one's intelligence.  The script could have been written by my dog Stan...and even then, I give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine.    Let's put it this way.  Have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much, you simply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away?  I was hoping the entire cast got mulched by Mr. Wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser.  Go "Darkwolf".  Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director, producer, writer and editors as quickly as possible...and don't wait until the next full moon.     "Darkwolf" is an insult to motion pictures.  More so, it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as "The Wolf Man", "Wolfen" and "The Howling", not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic "An American Werewolf in London".    Need I say more?  "Darkwolf" has no bite.  It's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion.  The box claims this flick to be "Half Man.  Half Wolf. Pure Evil."  In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid. Half/Whole Worthless.  ...and...Pure ^%&*!    Get my drift?  At midnight...as we turn another page and the new year unfolds...I promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman", much more than "Darkwolf".    I'm off to watch yet another New Year's flick before dawn.  I need to make amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. before midnight.    Bottom line, it was a film you didn't really care "where" the "wolf" came from, or where the werewolf was going.  Pitiful...embarrassing..."I've seen the bad moon rising" but this one makes me wish it would set! +dvd
Miserable acting, horrible script, inane directing.+N+What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.  As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous "nurse nipple" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.  But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.  On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the "story" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.  But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to+dvd
Casshan Volume 2+N+I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon.Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the &quot;description&quot;+dvd
a 'difficult' movie; unfortunately, it ain't very good either+N+It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, "Foxes" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation+dvd
One Of Andersons Misses+N+I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.    +dvd
The Best Season Yet+P+Season 3 of The L-Word is by far the best yet.  The character development and story have come so far since the 1st season, and are even better than season 2.  They have scaled back the sex a little bit, but when they do put it in, the sparks really fly.  I love the l-word+dvd
I've always dreamt for a DVD like this!+P+This has 110 minutes of the 1995 concert performed at Symphony Hall, Birmingham...& also has 3 music videos Don't Pay The Ferryman, Missing You, & Separate Tables!!+dvd
Good choice for light entertainment+P+The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again.  The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd+dvd
GIMME A BREAK!+P+As if this set could be anything BUT five stars!!!  Barbra Streisand - four of her films on their DVD debut - her own commentary - oy vey!  Order it now and plan a vacation day for the day after you get delivery+dvd
Russians Love a Good Soap Just Like Us+P+I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable+dvd
Party Hardy with Bear+P+This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking.  The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy, Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party.  Next comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party.  Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can.   This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs+dvd
Stroke of Genius+P+I'm not a golfing buff, but found the story and golf very good. I enjoyed this movie very much+dvd
An Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Novel.+P+David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.  This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.  This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).  True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.  This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)  Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.    In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture. +dvd
let's make this short and sweet...+N+This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time+dvd
Byou+N+My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with.  I think it is best for those with a dance background.  The music is good, though+dvd
Femme Fatales or Very Lame?+N+Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid+dvd
A clear understanding as to why Enron fell+P+I am a CPA & I watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take, essentially because of the fall of Enron. I have since bought the video & watched it at least 5 other times. Of course there are political slants. For example, they try & tie the Bush administration(s)(Sr. & Jr.) to Enron. But, the majority of the film deals with what happened to Enron, so that in the end, the stock you purchased was worth $0. I would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary. A riveting documentary on the rise & fall of Enron & who the major players in Enron were.+dvd
Not too impressed+N+The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.    Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine.   Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent. +dvd
This is just great stuff.....+P+Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story), but this is "Boogie Nights". I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic". Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form. What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people. Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works. I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will) Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive. If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it+dvd
Brilliant!+P+These guys are terrific! I'm a student of Shakespeare, so every time I read a play I haven't read before I pull out this DVD to see what they've done to it! After reading Coriolanus I was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play wasn't appropriate for children. If you love Shakespeare, or are just curious about Shakespeare, buy this DVD+dvd
The Carpetborers+N+This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow+dvd
A simple plot with some great slapstick action and pure comedy+P+I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection.  My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since.  It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy.  The plot is pure genius in its simplicity:  a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger.  A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice.  A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger.  The Beatles are absolutely clueless.  So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious.  The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French.  So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French.  Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window..+dvd
good cop movie+P+this is more realistic then some may admit. you see it all the time in the stories on tv, reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is, best example is michael jackson. everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side. that is what this movie is all about.  the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders. the plot was pretty original. i don't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong. it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism. you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting.  there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie. almost to the point of overwhelming, but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie. i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi. storylines are a bit different, but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story.+dvd
Not as good as Miyazaki's other titles+N+This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did+dvd
Shamefully Overlooked Southern Gothic Murder Mystery Has Atmosphere, Genuine Thrills and the Superb Blanchett+P+This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.  Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie.  Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.  While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.  In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us.  The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer+dvd
yeah yeah yeah+N+I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes. Maybe it was groundbreaking once, but I doubt it. Maybe you should watch it while stoned. He probably wrote it that way. +dvd
A totally boring movie+N+I terribly disappointed by this movie.  It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have.  This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end.  The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own.  Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie. +dvd
Mary Ann and Sissy Spacek+N+I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows.   This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie.+dvd
The novelty's worn off, and it's left as a former shell of itself+N+On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent.+dvd
Be Warned+N+I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen+dvd
Teusdays with Mauri+P+Terriffic Movie  just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt+dvd
Land of Oprahisms+N+Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry+dvd
watered down unanswered questions+N+I unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was the best of them.. the others were pure wastes of money. While this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point. if you've seen "what the bleep" dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds.+dvd
Better of many older submarine thrillers+P+I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice+dvd
A beautiful piece of cinematographic work+P+"From Hell" is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie.  Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.  Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.  This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good). "From Hell" makes a great addition to any movie collection.+dvd
Very Pleasantly Surprised!+P+We rented this movie not expecting too much.  We like this genre (moron movies).  Unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie, we had no trouble at all following the plot.  We just thought this movie was a scream!  Lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell.  What's not to like?  If you like this type of movie, you will love it!  Mac McCaule+dvd
Good Idea, altered for Artistic Purposes+P+This is a great "feel good" movie, but Hollywood altered the story for theatricality.  In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners.  There is a good backgroud article at:  http://reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml  that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam.  Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of "Miami Vice" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High.  The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents.  Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership.  That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's.  (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, "So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?")  Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future.  The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows. +dvd
Gave it a Chance but...+N+I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the "police" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle...  +dvd
Highly Recommended!!!+P+I first found out Hannah Montana when I realised I saw Billy Ray Cyrus, thinking it was someone else at first. Thank goodness I was wrong!!! I am quite older than being 13, (almost 30) but I loved Billy Ray Cyrus when he first came out in early 1990's, and still do. Now that his daughter Miley has her own show and an awesome voice, I not only do I get to see and hear him again, but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has. I knew I had to buy the dvd, not question there. It's a piece of my past, when I was a teen, but it's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work. It tells me to be a kid at heart, and laugh every now and then!!+dvd
U2's Best Live DVD Since ZooTV+P+From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs.  The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction.  As it should be.    Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums.  Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad).    This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list.  For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here.  Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD...+dvd
Treasure fans Beware!+N+Many of these shorts on this DVD (as well as the other DVD's in this series) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these DVD's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons+dvd
Great DVD! The Snake tells all...+P+Awesome DVD! Jake Roberts tells you everything from origin of the DDT to the drug addiction to the last time he appeared on WWE television. This is definitely a must have! Jake the Snake is a true legend and deserves to in the Hall of Fame. Maybe it will happen in 2006+dvd
Mediocre is good?+N+I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard+dvd
Loaded deck shoots blanks+N+Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film+dvd
Left & Right Brain Videos were big hits at our house!+P+I purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos.  I think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time.  These were the ONLY videos that ever captured his attention at that young age.  Any other video--Disney, Baby Einstein, etc.--just had him crying within a few minutes.  These, though, he would watch to the end, fascinated.  To this day, he loves them, and he is now 15 months old; the tapes are WORN OUT so I am reordering them both.  Not only does he still love them, but I just had a new baby, and I am hoping they will entertain her just as much.  In fact, the other night, we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and wouldn't go back to sleep.  Finally, in desperation, my husband popped one of these into the VCR, and my son was INSTANTLY quieted the moment he heard the familiar music; in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed.    We have since purchased most of the other titles in the Brainy Baby series--he loves them all, the music, the images of the babies, etc.  The ABC video is especially well-done.  He also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, etc.  But these two left & right brain videos are still his very favorites. +dvd
Really?+P+I didn't notice it was a bad movie. All I saw was Johnny Depp. Seriously, it's a great movie. I think maybe people are forgeting this started out as a childrens' movie.+dvd
A must for the home collection+P+I'm trying to decide which of the three I love the best, but all should be part of one's home library. I often view them while I'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster! It's easy to forget you're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs. Perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the Jurassic Park movie collection? Chrissy K. McVay - Autho+dvd
MacGyver on stupid pills+N+As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action+dvd
It was worth the money!+P+I had previously bought the 1st version. Liked it very much. So I was eagerly looking forward to this latest version. Happy to know that this version has more new Science related information - which was what I was interested in. And for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist, there is a seperate section entirely on Interviews. The best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations.  For those who have not seen the 1st version, I think it is alright to watch this. Viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie. The interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer. Everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world, universe and what they are made of. If you had deep question about the reality, you might find an answer in this movie.      -- Ravi, Singapor+dvd
KNOWLEDGE+P+Simply Fantastic!  Anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this.  Some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children. +dvd
it skips chapters+N+I have now received 2 copies of this DVD and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly. My personal favorite is the episode were Jerry is trying to become homecoming queen. It skips a whole chapter... THE WEESLE & THE CHICKEN... maybe the best comedy I have ever seen. Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter. I have had the same problem on all DVD players  +dvd
one of the best asian family film i have seen+P+Flawless and Beautifully Rieveting "The Joy Luck Club" has to be the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will be the only one of it's kind. The story is beautiful and timeless and I encourage everyone to see it. It makes you think of the relationships of your family and how, even though this is a movie, it can impact you beyond belief. It will rock you to the core of your being and I am living proof+dvd
so many gaps in the story+N+This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story+dvd
A good bit of drama mixed in with fun....+P+Y'know - I don't care what anyone else says 'bout this film. I liked it so there... :g: It was a good bit of childish fun at times, as well as a lot of drama. I cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war.  It's got funny stuff with the cousin and "It", which Eddie voices ever so brilliantly... and I loved the aunt.. I knew she was something special, siding with the children and helping them. I loved her! Kenneth Brannagh was hilarious as well. I don't know - I just loved it. I think you should give it a dry. I think it's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like CS Lewis or even Tolkien at times.  the moral of the story... wishes can't last forever... but you'll just have to see the movie to see what I'm talking about, now won't you? :+dvd
A disgrace to any integral female+N+There are two main female characters in the plot: one is a man-eater who will sleep her way to the top (although she may not even need it because she is good independently) and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband's. This is a man's fantasy and nightmare come true in one; and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world. To all the Hollywood men out there: You can't brainwash us anymore with your b/s; okay??+dvd
this movie has nothing to it!+N+This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters! I really don't recomend this one...at all!    P.S. Don't buy it, watch it or... anything else that is similer. What a snoozer, twenty bucks is such a loss+dvd
Pretty good despite cheesy title+P+It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time+dvd
Great dancing+P+Really nice dancing, with some innovative moves and choreography. The dancers are definetely top notch, just like their credentials would suggest. If do not want to watch another booooring and hokey ballroom show, this is the DVD for you. It ranks up there with "Shall We Dance"(Japanese version) as a great dance DVD. The last samba number is amazing. If there is one thing I would change with the show, it is that it does NOT have enough latin dancing. I kept waiting in vain for another chacha and a good salsa or rueda, and nothing happened ("Burn the Floor" guys - are you listening!?)+dvd
I wish I could go lower than this. +N+This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny.+dvd
not bad+P+i read some of the reviews before i purchased it. i agree that the dvd was not made with high tech, the toys used were not even new at all, the instructors making weird sounds (to me). i was disappointed at first and planned to sell it right away. but i thought i should give a try to my son, 16 months. surprisingly,it catches my 16 month boy full attention(he would not pay attention at all to baby bumblebee). he watches for over 2 weeks, he started to copy the sounds and gestures they made in the dvd. sometimes, he will even make the sounds before the instructor does. though , he still only says mama, but i am already so happy with the current result.+dvd
It's Flat & It's Not Funny+N+I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, "when am I going to laugh?" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison+dvd
Another one of those silly 80's movies.+N+The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete+dvd
You'll be in stitches!+P+It's a [more vulnerable] Patton in a white coat, running a hospital, and it's all great fun, with a good story from an Oscar-winning script.  You have to love it when Scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow. You half-expect him to finish her off with "There are brave men DYING out there!"+dvd
"Try this for a deep, dark secret..."+P+Yes, I was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming Remington Steele, which I actually preferred to Moonlighting. Pierce Brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang British that I wanted to be like him. The fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique. And Lord, I had such a crush on Laura Holt, who was beautiful, clever, earnest, athletic and kinda prudish (turns out, our little Miss Prim & Proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check). Anyways, I'm a sucker for freckles. One of the best things about Season One was the ultra-cool theme song by the great Henry Mancini. The music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery. Another cool thing was the intro voice-over of Stephanie Zimbalist: "Try this for a deep, dark secret. The great detective Remington Steele? He doesn't exist. I invented him. Follow..." And so, we do.  Skip this paragraph if you know the show's premise. Laura Holt is a very capable sleuth whose private investigative agency isn't drawing in the clients, mostly because she's a woman. So she invents a front man - a decidedly masculine superior - named Remington Steele (according to Laura, "Remington" is derived from a brand of typewriter, while "Steele" is from the Pittsburg Steelers). Soon, sure enough, clients are coming in droves. And then, one day, HE walked in. Episode one, License to Steele,  tells of the chance encounter between Laura Holt and a charming, urbane thief who steals her heart and, while he's at it, the name and identity of her agency.  The show Remington Steele ushered in a short era of sophistication and sly humor that recalled the best of vintage Hollywood. Brosnan and Zimbalist may not have gotten along well in real life, but as Steele and Holt, they were a match made in heaven. The show was ably supported by the yearning Murphy (James Read), who never did get over his suspicions (not totally unfounded) about Steele, and the gum-chewing Bernice Fox (Janet DeMay), whose name Remington chose to not clearly remember, much to her annoyance. Too bad the powers-that-be decided Murphy and Bernice were in the way of Remington and Laura's blossoming romance; they were written out by season two.  The mysteries themselves weren't all that original, more than a few being patterned after the plots of famous movies, which ties in nicely with Remington's penchant for quoting from Hollywood's golden age. But viewers didn't tune in for the quality of the mystery elements (don't get me wrong, they didn't suck), but rather - much like the classic Thin Man films - for the nova-intense chemistry between the two leads and their up-and-down romantic relationship. It would take a few seasons before their always-on-the-verge-but-never-quite-consumated flirtation became frustrating for the audience.    This season is the first and by far the best. Highlight episodes of Season One are:  License to Steele (episode 1) - Private eye Laura Holt is hired to protect some valuable, high profile jewelry, but an enigmatic (but very suave) British scam artist keeps popping up. Serious eye contact and innuendos are exchanged between the two, which later results in the con-man (who has his own problems) taking up the identity of the fictitious Remington Steele. Needless to say, a must see episode.   Thou Shalt Not Steele (episode 5) - A woman (Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's real wife at the time) from Steele's mysterious past convinces Steele to steal a painting rumored to be cursed from a Los Angeles museum exhibit. Problem is, Laura had already contracted to protect the valuable painting. Fun episode with Remington and Laura dabbling in professional thieving. This is the debut of Felicia, Remington's ex-flame, who shows up again in season 4.  In the Steele of the Night (episode 9) - Laura and Murphy attend a reunion party consisting of sleuths who used to work for the Havenhurst agency. One of the detectives is killed and Remington (who crashes the get-together) is elected to solve the murder. Very amusing, as Laura handfeeds clues to Remington, who attempts to look knowledgeable in front of his "peers."  Steele Trap (episode 10) - This one channels Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None. Remington and Laura show up at a weekend bash on the private island of a smut magazine publisher. And then people start getting killed off one by one.  Vintage Steele (episode 19) - Shenanigans in a winery and a recurring corpse. Laura stripteases and the two finally kiss. This is a cool episode and one of the most romantic. We finally find out stuff about Laura's past, specifically the reason why Laura doesn't like to mix business with pleasure.  Steele's Gold (episode 20) - Remington, Laura, and Murphy follow a prospector's journal, hoping to unearth gold. Hijinks in a ghost town and a wild treasure hunt in the desert. Fun episode.  Sting of Steele (episode 21) - The first sighting of Daniel Chalmers (Efrem Zimbalist Jr. - Stephanie's dad), Remington's mentor and surrogate dad, who shows up needing Steele's assistance in putting on an intricate sting to shake some villains off his back. Another vintage episode.  This box set contains four discs with all 22 episodes. Special features contain three episode commentaries (License to Steele, Tempered Steele, and Vintage Steele), as well as several making-of featurettes and character bios. Give this show a chance and see why it launched Pierce Brosnan to Hollywood's stratosphere. +dvd
Not a Comedy+N+This movie is being described and sold as a comedy.  It is not one.  It has several funny lines, but the movie is more of a romantic drama.  If you are looking for a comedy I do not recommend this at all+dvd
very stagnant+N+I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies+dvd
GREAT PRICE AND QUICK SHIPPING+P+THE LOWEST PRICE AT THE TIME I ORDERED IT AND REAL QUICK SHIPPING TOO+dvd
Why oh why?+N+Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...  Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.   First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!   I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.  If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.  Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one+dvd
So 'politically correct' it sucks!+N+"I can't believe they named me after that book--it's so sexist!" After Amelie, where she was a delight, as well as open-minded, AT should have passed on this loser!   Political correctness is just intolerance by another name! But you can't tell a liberal that! It's bad here in USA but I suppose the French must be the worst? They have fined Bardot for merely expressing her opinions that muslims are barbaric! Talk about intolerant.  +dvd
Good information...+P+I bought this DVD and I was not disappointed.  I give it a 4 only because there wasn't complete balance in all of the "experts".  Particularly the Mary Magdelene expert.  Not that it really mattered, but there was now counterpoint to her beliefs that "Jesus used to kiss Mary on the mouth, much to the Disciples chagrin".    For those who claim bias, I would slightly disagree.  Dan Brown has said that his book was fiction.  So for National Geographic to create a documentary investigating something that was ficticious from the start is admirable.  Some Amazon reviewers call this DVD biased and even believe that the Catholic Church funded the DVD.    I honestly beg to differ.  The Da Vinci Code is a fanciful story.  So for National Geographic to take the bait and create this DVD, gives Dan Brown more exposure.  If anything, this DVD portrays the early Catholic Church as misogynous with their negative and false depiction of Mary Magdelene.  The debunking of The Priory of Sion with its exclusive membership is comical as well.  But they had to research it as it was derived from the book.    The DVD Bonus features are pretty good as well.  They give you a little True/False quiz at the end.  Man will continue to search for proof.  However, those who believe in God (and have a relationship with him), need not apply empirical evidence or follow logical conclusions to prove or disprove the Da Vinci Code.  Even if the Da Vinci Code was completely true (which it isn't), that wouldn't change my faith or belief.  This is something that the DVD touched on.  It is Christ's message that is important, not necessarily His social life.  +dvd
A Celebration of Hopelessness+N+I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic".+dvd
Good relationship movie+P+I really enjoyed this movie if only for Joan Allen's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21. Kevin plays a retired baseball player now DJ (for WRIF-FM, the station I listened to often in Detroit when I was in my late teens and early '20s). He too drinks way too much. They find solace in each other.  I loved watching Joan Allen and the movie does have a good script. I liked all the major characters in it except one. All but the detestable middle age guy. He only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate.  I think most women over 40 will like this movie. I highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships. +dvd
Exercise video for people who really aren't serious+N+This video is broken into six 10-minute sections. Who in their right mind would work out for only 10 minutes? This is not going to accomplish anything. Well, you think I'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other. This is silly too, because each 10 minute segment includes a warmup, small workout routine, and stretches. Unless it is okay with you to do all this over and over again, it is not an effective use of your time. Especially if you are truly trying to accomplish a goal+dvd
Slow building classic Horror+P+Saw Burnt Offerings first as a kid on TV, just realized this was the title of it after seeing the picture on the back of the box of the old woman in a chair sitting by the window, a very classic horror image I didn't forget. The story builds slowly, as the small family of Mother, Father, Son and Aunt begin to experience strange occurences in the giant mansion. There's one room with an old lady in it that we don't get to see till the end, which really builds up some fear in a effective way, rather than quick, cheap scares like so many films rely on these days. The ending is truly classic. This one's worth watching for Haunted Mansion fans. There's very little you see, but very much that is suggested. Has some similarities to The Shining+dvd
Good performances, astoundingly bad script+N+Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable "thriller" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?  While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot "twist" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else.  And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless.   If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent. But she is certainly nice to watch, especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious, delicious, nutritious, I-want-some-of-that-icious body. But hey, when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal, right?  Rent this one first if you absolutely must see it.+dvd
First rule of the fight club - You must be a white male to love this movie+N+This movie was very much like American Beauty, except it was a little better. This kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern American life. But for all other people, including myself, Fight Club was not that good. And I GET the movie. I am a consumer, like most Americans. But not to a degree where I can relate to Jack who is the main character. Starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one's identity is an absurd idea. What is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of Fight Club. No wonder the only people that joins the Fight Club in the movie are white males. No wonder that the only real people in my life that I saw raving about this movie so far has been all "white men". The movie does speak one truth. Modern American life  has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans. Like I said, I have not come to that point yet and I do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful. People should build a family, serve their community, and make real friends to live a happy and significant life. Fight Club is not necessary unless you really became like Jack. Do not watch this movie unless you are white male. Watch if you are really curious, but it will be a waste of time+dvd
who's having a baby?+P+BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies.  she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club".  Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever.+dvd
Great Movie!+P+My girlfriend told me about this movie.  Up until then I have never heard about it.  This movie was alot better then I thought it would be.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  It kept me on my toes the entire time+dvd
inside look at afghanistan-a true storyline, wonderful+P+a great story based on a real tale of one canadian/afghan womens journey back to afghanistan to search for her frined, who is depressed and contemplating suicide due to the opression and devastation all around. in the movie the friend is actually her sister. the main character relives her actual travels and shows you many things in afghanistan that contribute to the situation her friend is facing, such as hunger, death, robbery, oppression of women and their basic rights, religious fanaticism, etc... although she is not able to reach her destination of kandahar, either in real life or in the movie, the movie will show you the devastation the afghan people face day to day, and the lengths people go to survive. there are some comical moments, and some real heartfelt moments throughout. one of the best films made about afghanistan, and a true story to boot. directed by the great mohsen makhmalfbaf, if you buy this please view the commentary by the women in the film, it contains great info as to what the situation was like making the film, and her own personal story. also, the dvd contains a special news braodcast about her life, in canada and afghanistan+dvd
Take out your hunting knife and gut the book+N+Never have I seen a movie violate a book so badly. John Grisham's Runaway Jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction, in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on Big Tobacco in the courtroom. The movie Runaway Jury is a slapped-together suspense chase, in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers.  This movie is, at most, a caricature of the book, and not a flattering one at that. Hackman transforms Fitch's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall. Parts of Marlee's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events. The most interesting aspects of the story--jury selection and Nicholas Easter's manipulation of the court--are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around.  If I had never read the book, I would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick, rent-worthy at best. But knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad. Even if you aren't a lover of fiction, I highly recommend buying the book instead.+dvd
the o.c+P+i am a very big fan of the o.c but i must admit that it is getting worse and worse i hate to say this cause really like it but i hope it gets better. whats making it worse is that A LOT is happening in one episode and the hero is always rayen. well  lets hope for the best i cant wait for the next season since the finale was a real clif hanger+dvd
the book is better.  The movie is still good.+P+Pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of John Grisham and bring it all onto the screen.  They do a pretty good job.  Matt Damon plays Rudy, a student in law school who's smart, broke, and about to make history.  In the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer.  The policy covered it but they would just not pay.  Meantime Damons character is in deeper than ever, as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out.  Read the novel, then watch the movie.  It's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving.  Danny DeVito plays Damons partner in the film and it's one of the better roles I've seen him play. +dvd
Surprising Gem in Gay Cinema!!+P+When I first heard of this title I thought that it would be just another bad soft core porn video but I was very surprised to find that this movie was very good!!  The movie starts with two guys just looking for sex and shows all the things that get in the way of their sex.  By the end of the movie there looks to be a relationship there and you feel that it is not just about sex byt also love.  The grin on your face is hard to wipe off after seeing this movie!! This is one gay flick that is worth checking out!+dvd
The best of the bunch+P+I had watched the Bananas special with Jeff Allen on it, but I wanted to see more, so I bought this DVD.  It had a little more funny stuff on it, but the serious talk he gave for a portion of the show was great too.  This is a seriously funny man that you should check out. One of the best comedians I have ever seen+dvd
I disagree+P+After reading the reviews above I decided to chime in with my two cents.  Although I agree Joe Public may find this movie a bit dry and at times unrealistic I must say that this is an unfair assesment and that the film has it's audience.  Currently I am working on my masters in Psychology and I must say that the depiction of an individual who is seriously considering suicide is far more accurate than most films today.  Despite popular opinion, those who attempt suicide are rarely brudding goths who always see the more morbid side of things and listen to Metallica.  They are generally normal people who just feel tired and lost, something that Paul Rudd brings across in spades.  Although they seldom film their deaths, most suicide attempties do discuss killing themselves and are often aware of how "indulgent" it may seem to others, a point discussed in the film.  Thus it is unfair to say that this movie is bad based on a half founded belief that the content is unrealistic+dvd
Unbelievable Acting and Cinematography - downright depressing though+P+This movie is going to bring you down.  That's a fact.  But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves.  A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man.  It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service+dvd
German Ingenuity+P+If you would like to know how life was on a German Submarine in WW2, then this is the movie for you. It will keep you glued to your seat.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in WW2 history and how the thoughts of German sailor's were not much different then our own.   +dvd
Free to Be You and Me - As Long As You Are Like Me+N+I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children+dvd
Do We Really Need Movies Like This?+N+From the opening line of "Bully" (in which 'Marty' explicitly mentions oral sex) I knew I wasn't going to like this film. Thank goodness I saw it on HBO and didn't waste my money on a rental. Once again, we have ANOTHER movie about dysfunctional upper-middle-class white families, in which the kids are a bunch of spoiled, drug-abusing, potty-mouthed brats, with parents that are nothing more than over-indulgent, inneffectual, clueless dolts. Wow, what a stretch for an "indie" film. Although this movie is based on a novelized "true" story by reporter Jim Schutze, about a murder that took place in Florida, the screenwriter and director seem only halfway interested into getting into the minds of the kids that committed this horrible crime, wasting the other half of the movie with scenes of gratuitous sex and full-frontal nudity that gives this movie the feel of a kiddie-porn flick that's intended to appeal to [...]. On top of that, the girl who instigated the murder was described in Shutze's book as chubby and plain, while the film makers took "artistic license" in their casting of cute, petite little Rachel Miner as Lisa. I guess the director figured that a chubby girl couldn't incite a good-looking young boy to kill for her, even though that's what happened in the book! Or perhaps the film makers wanted a pretty-looking young girl for all the teeneie nudity the role required. At the of the sleaze-fest is a violent murder, and director Larry Clark is uncompromising in his portrayal of the brutality of the act. Bobby (the 'bully') is reduced from a sadistic, foul-mouthed closet [...] to a screaming baby, begging for his life as he is repeatedly stabbed. Ultimately, his best friend Marty cuts his throat. Murder is a horrifying, messy act, and director Clark gives you a bird's-eye view of what a real murder may look like. This 5 minute scene should be clipped and shown to any kid that's considering committing such an awful act. It is truly hard to watch. Other than that, the film is just trash. Larry Clark could have effectively made all of his points without all the graphic sex, nudity, dirty language, and the [...] dildo scene in Bobby's bedroom. What hurts the film's believeability even more is the stereotypical treatment of the kids' parents as disconnected morons who act as unknowing enablers to these kids' rotten lifestyles. Liberal film-makers love to blame the parents, and not a pop culture environment that glorifies sex, drugs, and violence, teaching our kids disobedience, in spite of all that parents try to do to counteract this onslaught. The 5 minute scene portrying the murder of Bobby Kent should be used as part of a 'scared straight' program for wanna-be gangsters. The rest of the movie belongs in the dumpster.  'Nuff said'+dvd
Don't  waste your money+N+The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie+dvd
murder she wrote--second season+N+the disks in this set are double sided and there are problems.  one or two of the episodes are unreadable.  we returned the first set, which had an entire unreadable side on one of the cd's.  the replacement was better, but not perfect.  the single sided cd's in other sets are MUCH better and highly reliable as to quality.  double sided just have built in flaws and i wish they would discontinue them.+dvd
waggy mcwaggster+N+Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy.   i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr+dvd
Surprisingly slight and insubstantial+N+The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third.   Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up.+dvd
Worst Service - Do not buy from these guys+N+I only wish it were possible to give them no stars, or just red x's. These guys never shipped my order, and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then Amazon. Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's+dvd
Superb documentary+P+What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void.   The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it.  Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened  economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.+dvd
No need to Suicide+N+I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character+dvd
Worst movie I have ever seen...+N+I really wish Amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash.  Some less than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my collection!"  HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!!+dvd
Love These Workouts!!+P+This DVD is Great! I watched the first 2 seasons of the show so I could relate to the people in the video, because I saw how much weight they have lost, and how their lives have changed by getting fit. Those who have never seen the show can still relate to the participants because you can see that they are working hard and struggling also. I have lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks by eating healthy and doing this video daily. I mix n match work-outs each day.+dvd
ugh!+N+I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!+dvd
Changed My Perceptions of Michael Moore+P+I saw the last half hour of this movie on the Bravo network last week when I was actually looking for a rerun of "Project Runway," so my first exposure to it was the segment with K-Mart and the interview with Charlton Heston.  Wow. I ended up being grateful "Project Runway" wasn't on. I made sure to catch "Bowling for Columbine" when Bravo ran it again, so I could see the whole thing. They showed it again last night.  I have to say here that, prior to this, I'd never seen anything of Michael Moore's (except for one episode of "TV Nation") and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things I'd heard, including things Moore fans had raved about that I thought were negative, such as the way Moore confronts people in his films.   What surprised me about "Bowling for Columbine" was what came across to me as Michael Moore's compassion. I really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances. I have much greater respect for him than I had before I saw the film. His motivating factor doesn't seem to me to be so much political as moral. He truly is a moralist. He reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way. (Who an awful lot of people found annoying, if I need remind anyone.) For him, I don't think it's so much "Corporations and other powerful entities are evil" as "People not caring about other people--especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate--results in separation and hostility between people, which leads to evil." Well, shoot, they preach that in my church every Sunday. And, last time I checked, we weren't socialists.   Also: I had heard, even from Moore fans, that his interview with Charlton Heston was unfortunate and embarrasing. But I don't agree. Why shouldn't he have asked Heston why he did what he did? Why on earth would Heston have gone to Denver and Flint after what happened? I just don't understand it. Some people said Heston was obviously suffering from Alzheimer's and incapable of carrying on the interview. He seemed entirely lucid to me. He was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he didn't want to answer the questions.   Thank you, Michael Moore, for leaving Kayla Rolland's photo behind. Maybe Charlton Heston took it inside. Maybe it made some kind of difference.    Peac+dvd
Disappointng+N+I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!  The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up.  I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration!  I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine.  In only broke my spirits!  Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!  One of the worst workouts I have ever seen+dvd
I don't care so much about the foul language.+N+I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent.    People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get "whacked" a lot. +dvd
See how it began+P+It's been 25 years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much hasn't. A quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that Love and Death could ever co-exist. Now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce. See this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable+dvd
Wake Up!+P+I think Orwell could almost sit up and cackle "I TOLD you so!" even as we gobble nachos and watch Monday night football (or PBS or Fox - doesn't matter).  Between the propaganda we are fed by the Republican mercantilists or the Democratic marxists, there is little truth.  Watch this film, then try to find a theater showing Aaron Russo's "America: From Freedom to Fascism".  Then be afraid - but not for long. Get up and take action+dvd
Classic+P+A movie with one good line after another, funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players. Just a great funny movi+dvd
Ludicrous!+N+This DVD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever watched.  There is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production.  The water crystals are pretty ;-) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense+dvd
Typical rom-com for genre/bullock/affleck fans only+N+If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.  Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.  Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?  The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.  The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.  You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable. +dvd
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ+N+Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting+dvd
The American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1969, Vol. 3+P+Excellent, great camera work, very good sound and commentar+dvd
why we need birth control...+P+i think this movie, although depressing, was a good example of the survival instinct manifested in children. Maybe in some sort of perverted way i thought that these children would become expert in the ways of survival, and that this experience could be a positive in their lives as they got older. These kids were being knoked around early in life and this, hopefully, would only make them stronger granting them a true picture of reality and the dog eat dog lifestyle of capitalism. These kids are a model for the capitalist system that encourages a rugged darwinian individualism. A part of me wishes that I would have spent a few years on the street like these kids (sans the Aurolac if possible). If anything we should admire these children for their incredible innocent strength...this is urban primitivism and liberty at its best especially when contrasted with those fat and ugly pampered Bucharetians chillin' at Sydney's cafe...+dvd
maybe it just hasn't aged well...+N+ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.  I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.  but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.  take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.  so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one+dvd
Although very violent & graphic, this is an awesome movie+P+Menace II Society is one of those films that leaves a powerful message that is not forgotten long after you have seen it. The story focuses on a teenage street thug who is caught in the middle of gang life and drugs but doesn't know how to escape it. After getting carjacked while cruising with his cousin on the streets of South Central LA, the main character swears revenge on the gangsters who killed his cousin.   This movie is very violent and has a lot of language, but it should be shown to every teenager entering high school to show them what can happen if they decide to hook up with the wrong people and make the wrong choices in life. Although I did not like the ending very much, the impact of the film was very powerful and left quite an impact. It showed me that if you mess with the wrong people and don't take responsibility for your actions, you will get dealt with and quite possibly, killed.  The main character gets murdered because he sleeps with some chick and gets her pregnant. She tells him, and he's like "What the heck are you telling me for? I had the plastic on extra tight." Condoms are not foolproof. They can slip and they can break. If you are gonna be with a woman for one night, make sure she is on something else, or pull out.   The digital transfer to the DVD is first rate. The audio is outstanding in both the 2 channel Dolby Surround format as well as the 5.1 channel Digital tracks. Highs and lows are both top notch... Be sure to warn your neighbors if you have thin walls. I had sound complaints after I played this movie on my system! The bass from the subwoofer as well as the gunshots during the whole movie is so loud, you feel as if it is happening right in front of you. Amazing..+dvd
not just a good day+P+it's a great day for da hood. i loved all three of em but unfortunately only own friday+dvd
Dumbest movie ever+N+The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false.  The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents.  Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them "again" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.  In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK.  But this is a mainstream legal thriller.  It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason.  But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is+dvd
Nice blend+P+I enjoyed this workout.  I love yoga for its awakening of the muscles and concentrated breathing, but it was my first experience with pilates.  I enjoyed the mix because it gave my abs and biceps a workout, you get to reward your muscles w/nice stretches, and the 40 minutes went by quickly.  I feel the pilates and yoga were blended well in this workout - great for beginner in either+dvd
Inexpensive Backstage Tour+P+I rated this only four stars because the audio track on my DVD was out of sync with the video.  It appears that the film to DVD transfer didn't compensate for the film audio being several frames ahead of the images.  On the other hand I now have images of the Utilidors.  I managed to take two backstage tours of Walt Disney World during the 1990's.  The Keys to the Kingdom tour and the three-park Backstage Magic tour were expensive and took up an entire day--but I thought them worth the trouble and expense.  It took me three years to book the Backstage Magic tour, and for several good reasons I didn't get to take home photographs of the backstage areas such as the Utilidors.  Modern Marvels provided me video images to keep these vital infrastructure of Walt's utopian village fresh in my mind.  I learned about the new Expedition Everest ride, and how the Tree of Life was grown by the Imagineers.  I love the Monorail system and the Contemporary Resort--featured!  This DVD lets me tour Walt Disney World and its secrets in the comfort of my home, without flying cross-country and putting up with crowds.  It isn't "the real thing," but this DVD allows me to scratch my Walt Disney World itch until I get the time and a couple of thousand dollars to return to Orlando+dvd
Pretty stupid and obnoxious+N+Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.   +dvd
"Is this funny still?  Yet?  I honestly can't tell..."+N+Seasons One, Two, Three:  "Go Man, Go!"  Season Four: the one to forego.  Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning ("People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things."), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare "Mister Mr. Show" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find "Season Four" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package.    Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life,  says that Four was the season when "well-crafted" sketches were "in", "absurdity for absurdity's sake" was "out".  No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers.  Translation:  they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner).   Enticing as the term is, "well-crafted" here seems to mean "warmed over SNL type stuff", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is "funny" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl.   Overall, MS4's concepts  become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy.  I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior?  (ex-cel-si-or   (n.)   Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)).     This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours.  One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of "Monster Parties" (as documented in novelty songs such as "Halloween Shindig", "Dracula's Pajama Party" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar.  Original, bent premise anchored by yet another  simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance.  For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny.  Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass. +dvd
the impostors+N+It was terrible! Lili played a good part of course. But the rest was just plain stupid+dvd
NOT DANCING+N+If you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking. If you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again!  This video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing "club" clothing instead of spandex. I was very disappointed with this purchase+dvd
Ah, Romance!+P+My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of "healthy" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story.+dvd
Not too good for kids+N+Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program.+dvd
The funniest show on TV+P+The funniest dry humor on TV.  The season just doesn't have enough episodes!  But who are we kidding, I could watch these episodes again and again.  My favorite-  "The Alliance".  ENJOY!+dvd
Can I Get Some Coffee Please!+N+If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was "History of Violence" On critics top ten list, everyone was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was "been there done that". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off. So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be+dvd
Incoherent, passionless, garbage.+N+I watched this movie and I have no idea what it was about. Admittedly it had the usual post-modern, post-Matrix action movie tropes, improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things (I'm a big fan of Charlize Theron in a sheer body suit), lots of explosions, a vast, behind the scenes conspiracy (well, that's kind of redundant, most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the Imperial Storm Troopers in Star Wars look like Marine snipers, but other than that what was this movie about? It's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes, throw them up against the wall, see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results. What comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand. "Aeon Flux" is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with better looking actors and a huge production budget. Well no, it's not even that, say what you will about Ed Wood, he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them, but it's doubtful that anyone involved in "Aeon Flux" viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck, and it shows. Save your money, in a few years this will be on Showtime late at night as a replacement for "Beastmaster III" and if you're up late you can watch it then+dvd
Liquid TV Revisited+P+This move gets my vote as I'm some one of the Liquid TV era I  enjoyed see the animated Aeon take a real person roll.  The movie leaves room for sequals as was the Idea with origonal animated version. Hopefully there will be more to come.  She's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation.  The Science Fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence.  It would be nice if MTV was still as entertaining as Aeon+dvd
Civil War+P+Great movie, great actors for such a sad part of the U.S. history ! It is great to see in this movie some men who really existed (especially "Stonewall" Jackson). We don't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction, but at the end of the day it's not very important, because the historical interest is preserved +dvd
terrible+N+this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.   The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)  This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinio+dvd
Truly Amazing!+P+I have been a Firm Believer for a couple years now and this video still kicks my butt!  Everytime I do this video my thighs and fanny are so sore the next day that it hurts to sit!  If you want fast results you can see and feel then this is the video for you!  Jen Carmen is very motivating and tough.  There is no quitting with her.  She makes you want finish this workout.+dvd
Haven't seen it yet+P+I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody+dvd
Cliched story, inferior animation.+N+We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.+dvd
The World of Crossword Puzzles Explored - Good Stuff+P+For me, crossword puzzles have been a casual thing, I might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife, who is a much more avid fan, might have left a partially finished one about, which I will pick up and see if I can find some answers.  Those who appear in this movie find crossword puzzles to be anything but casual. And this is not about just any crossword puzzle. This is the "gold standard." The NYT crossword puzzle. You may genuflect if you wish.  As the movie unfolds we hear how the NYT graduates the difficulty of its puzzles from Monday to Sunday. We learn how they are constructed, how they are made more difficult, what the rules of puzzle building are and how crossword puzzles infect and afflict those who are addicted to them. Celebrities from Ken Burns to Jon Stweart are utilized in cameo pieces, some of which are very entertaining.  This all culminates in the Marriott Hotel in Stamford, CT where the World Crossword Puzzle Championship takes place every year in March. We meet some of the contestants, we are shown how the tournament is organized and the friendships it has engendered during the years it has been held and as the days pass we get to the "A" finals where three finalists try to solve a puzzle against time on large easels set up at the front of the room which will really draws you in to the genre.  Whether crossword puzzles are your thing or not, this is an entertaining and interesting movie to see. It did not encourage me to increase my crossword puzzle activity, but it sure gave me a deeper appreciation of what those who are hooked on it go through. There is something in this movie for everyone.+dvd
claptrap+N+That which is original in this program is biased and untrue. That which is true is not original. This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as "Rats, Lice, and History" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous. National Geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this+dvd
Great Movie!+P+This is a great movie. This movie has some sexual references, but no nudity. There is  some profanity but definitely a funny movie that is geared to older children about 14 and up.+dvd
Great workout  W/ variations+P+This DVD is a great addition to my colletction! I am able to vary my workout and feel challenged! The instructor is knowledgable, easy to listen to, and explains the moves in detail. There are so many workouts to choose from- it gives you many choices (so you're not bored) So glad I bought it!! You do need a few prop+dvd
The guys can't act+N+I'm not a professional critic or one that watches many movies.  I just love 80's movies and since this movie had good reviews, I had to watch it.  I was so dissapointed with the nerd and the rebel's bad acting in the movie; It was just horrible!  I like the storyline and the soundtrack, but the acting really ruined everything.  If you just want to watch it to see some skin and not for good quality acting, then this is your movie+dvd
CSI CONTINUES TO SHINE+P+Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically.  In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises:  Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self.  We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more.  The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television.  Brilliant show just keeps getting better+dvd
A Sexy, Exciting Thriller+P+Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations.  Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage.  Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn).  They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say.  They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors.  But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye.    Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations.  They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody).  Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane.  The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them.  Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband.  What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife?  Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle?  Will John and Jane join forces to save each other?  I thought this was a very good movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes.  There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are perfect together, and the film will keep you on your toes throughout.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  This movie gives new meaning to "till death do us part". +dvd
7 million dollars at box office-No one was there to see this movie+P+The Man Who Wasn't There is a movie by the always unpredictable Coen brothers. Their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it's fun to see what they've come up with next. Out of the ones I've seen, my thoughts are mixed. I mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like Raising Arizona, then one of the best movies of all time with Fargo and then go terribly wrong from there? Then you've got the Big Lebowski, a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness. Not what I call a good movie. Then there's the Ladykillers, a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything. So they're just getting worse by age, right? Wait! Let's go back two years to 2001.  It was in this year that this unheard of movie was made. Of course, its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle. And that's the beauty of this gem. The cinematography. The look of this world and the 1940s feel it's good is brilliant. But it's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own. It is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others. But first, let's talk about the plot of the movie. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) is living in California in the 40s with his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand). Doris is part of a community that talks and talks. But not Ed. Ed narrates this story...his story. He sees it in black and white or maybe that's the way it really is. You've got to think. Ed is a barber and is proud of his job. He only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration. So here, there is some more originality, brilliance and beauty. When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), he reacts with harshness. He blackmails Big Dave but something goes wrong. Big Dave finds out and Ed kills him out of defense. And this all happens in the first 30 minutes. Doris is accused of doing it and from then on, you're in for a real treat.   When Ed isn't narrating, like I already said, he isn't talking. So what he does is smoke, cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed Birdy (Scarlett Johansson) play piano. Her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty.  Tony Shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. He's a big shot who talks and talks. Keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the "you don't know" repeated a bunch of times. Believe me, you'll know when you're hearing it.  The movie is a sad and tragic tale, a tale showing how badly one man's life can go in a world that isn't for him. He's different. It's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one...he stands out because he's different.  The Man Who Wasn't There is hands down an excellent movie. It is a close second to Fargo in the Coen's movies.  My last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves. This movie is rated R for a scene of violence? Is that a joke? That scene was in black and white and showed NOTHING! You people really have no idea what you're doing. Pulp Fiction (R)=The Man Who Wasn't There (R) Get it straight people, your ratings are horrid. James Bond flicks have worse content than this. +dvd
All lies, an attack on america...+N+For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.  Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!  In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.  Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.  Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.      +dvd
Does the field of intention love nature?+P+The Power of Intention is both inspiring and troubling. As an environmental and social activist who lives off of less the 10k per year, I was wondering as I read this book if I was holding in my hands what was once an Ancient Tree? Our Ancient Ancestors are being clear cut at an alarming rate in the Pacific Northwest. Most will go extinct in our lifetimes. Corporations continue to consolidate their political power in both mainstream parties: Democrat and Republican alike enact legislation on behalf of corporations that will open what is left of these ancient giants to clear-cutting. Stories will be told of these trees on day, perhaps even to our own grandchildren beginning with the words, "Once upon a time there was a great and majestic forest."   Your Democratic and Republican representatives are now organizing the last Buffalo hunt. You can still have your voice be heard on behalf of these ancient trees before it is too late.   On page 48 of his book Mr. Dyer makes the following observation, "Practice kindness toward the Earth by picking up a piece of litter that's on your path, or saying a silent prayer of gratitude for the existence of rain, the color of flowers, or even the paper you hold in your hand that was donated by a tree."  Sadly, Mr. Dyer's observation is confused. The paper we hold in our hands is produced by multi-national corporations on public lands administered by bureaucrats marching to one tune: politicians who accept large gratuities in the form of moneyed transactions so favorable legislation opens these national treasures to exploitation.  This book review is offered as a creative challenge to Mr. Dyer to connect to the field of intention on behalf of non-sentient life. Hopefully, the field of intention extends the same beneficence to the astonishing field of nature, not in a fashion that promotes anthropocentrism and narcissism, but rather amplifies the web of life and its connections to human life so that a win-win situation is advocated rather than diminished.   This begs the question: is the book worth the $24.95 I paid to read it? I suppose that if the field of intention can be tapped into for the benefit of our Earth Mother, my answer is yes! If, on the other hand, the spiritual principles are used only for generating prosperity for the self alone, then the $24.95 would be better spent planting a tree to help offset the expense of Mr. Dyer's next best seller.+dvd
STUPID PACKAGING & SHAMEFUL OFFER+N+When you receive this set, they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf, for an additional $2.98. What arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder.   20th Century Fox Entertainment should be boycotted. They make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs.  I love THE SIMPSONS, but I am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case+dvd
Warning: This is What will Happen if Gay Marriage Goes Nationwide!!!!+N+Just kidding. Actually, Massachusetts has nothing to worry about. The people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as Martians would (an effect Fellini was deliberately going for). The only reason I rented this disc is because John Lennon once said that the Beatles' life on tour was like Fellini's Satyricon. I can only hope that the Fab Four's nights in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan were more fun than this movie. More a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative, Satyricon (just how does one pronounce it anyway?) bets eveything on its visuals. Some work and are impressive, but after a half hour, even diehard film buffs will tire of watching Fellini try to top himself every five minutes. I hated Fellini's La Dolce Vita. But, being a good sport, I decided to give the famed Italian director one more shot by watching this. I don't think I want to go for strike three anytime soon. One could pretty much watch the scenes in any order. As an added annoyance, it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming, just like they did in the spaghetti Westerns. Since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists, one only has imagery to go on. So, let me describe the movie in montage form. We see large slabs of meat, bonfires, fat pedophiles, fat homosexuals, thin homosexuals, a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice, an annoying poet with a beautiful voice. There are midgets, galley slaves, oily wrestling matches, a sweaty Minotaur, heads chopped off, mutilations, suicides, a man swinging from a noose, lots of froliking, little real sex and no eroticism, an earthquake, sabers, Centaurians, dusty vistas, squeaky wagons, a pasty-faced demi-god, painted woman, painted men, loin cloths, art work, and as Cosmo Kramer once said, lots of unbridled enthusiasm. What does it all add up to? Two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted. If you want great imagery in a foreign film, stick with Werner Herzog's work.+dvd
Awful!+N+I rented this movie from Netflix recently, expecting a wonderfully campy, cheesy horror film. WRONG. Its just an hour and a half of boring film.  The plot is lacking, the characters are annoying, especially Duane.  Its simply a ridiculous film+dvd
Calvin's journey is amazing!+P+Okay so Calvin isn't the smartest, bravest, coolest kid in his hometown,  Receda. But after he loses a baseball game for his team the Knights he is  magically transported back in time to the days of King Arthur. A place  where is 20th century knowlege and courage is all that can protect him.  WHen he finds out that Merlin himself was the one that brought him hear he  is shocked (and so is Merlin) that Calvin is supposed to be a Hero that  will save King Arthur's Kingdom. Will Calivn suceed? Or is he better of in  the 20th century. If you like Midevil tales and kid flicks you should see  this movie. Hey, Cal isn't that bad looking either =+dvd
Better than the others+P+I bought this movie last year on a hum bug. This movie really surprised me. I really enjoyed it. My daughters love it as well. We watch it constantly and the soundtrack is awesome too+dvd
Gov't of the Lobbyists, by the Lobbyists, and for the Lobbyists+P+"The Big Buy" may not have the slick gloss of other documentaries, but the content is invaluable in understanding how American democracy has been hijacked.  Birnbaum and Schermbeck show how Tom DeLay deliberately reengineered the electoral system to create an incestuous alliance of lobbyists and government officials on a scale not seen before in American politics.  This culture of corruption demands business representatives pay thousands of dollars for access to politicians -- akin to practices normally associated with self-serving Third World governments.  In the meantime, the interests of average Americans are shunted aside.  The documentary cautions that, even though DeLay has had to step down, others of his ilk have replaced him  and are carrying on his legacy.  Another outstanding source revealing the magnitude of corruption that has taken hold is PBS's Bill Moyers on America.  The first episode, "Capitol Crimes," connects the dots regarding Jack Abramoff, Tom DeLay, Grover Norquist and others who brought an agenda to D.C. to buy out Congress with a view to creating a permanent Republican Congress whose power derives from monies given to it by big business.  One definition of Fascism is a government aligned in partnership with corporate businesses.  "The Big Buy" shows how Tom DeLay has created that model for American in the 21st century.  It begs the question -- as we now try to export democracy to other countries -- can we claim to be democracy anymore+dvd
Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people+N+Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama.+dvd
Sugar Coated Luther...+N+I see a lot of positive reviews posted here... The historical Luther will not be found in this movie. No doubt the audience is predominantly Lutheran. From a secular entertainment point of view, I would agree with them. 4 Stars. The attention to detail is excellent; it is well acted, well written, well casted. However, director Eric Till has made Luther into a hero. He was no hero. History reveals the truth that is so glaringly absent in the film. The only thing that rang true was that Luther was an anti-establishment, religious zealot reformer, just like Jesus, (only Jesus hated gentiles, calling them "dogs and swine)."   I challenge Till to make a "Luther Part 2," using excerpts of Luther's OWN WORDS below as the script. It smack's of a Hitler biography/// . Disclaimer: If you are Lutheran, brace yourself. He blatently advocated a slow genocide of the Jews. Hitler picked up on what Luther was throwin' down... "The Jewish vermin... shall have their homes razed... curfews set... business banned..." etc. This is the Luther that is never portrayed. Ad hominem or not, how can Lutheranism be trusted when it's founder was such a hateful individual?              The Jews and Their Lies, by Martin Luther   "I had made up my mind to write no more either about the Jews or against them. But since I learned that these miserable and accursed people do not cease to lure to themselves even us, that is, the Christians, I have published this little book, so that I might be found among those who opposed such poisonous activities of the Jews who warned the Christians to be on their guard against them. I would not have believed that a Christian could be duped by the Jews into taking their exile and wretchedness upon himself. However, the devil is the god of the world, and wherever God's word is absent he has an easy task, not only with the weak but also with the strong. May God help us. Amen.  He did not call them Abraham's children, but a "brood of vipers" [Matt. 3:7]. Oh, that was too insulting for the noble blood and race of Israel, and they declared, "He has a demon' [Matt 11:18]. Our Lord also calls them a "brood of vipers"; furthermore in John 8 [:39,44] he states: "If you were Abraham's children ye would do what Abraham did.... You are of your father the devil. It was intolerable to them to hear that they were not Abraham's but the devil's children, nor can they bear to hear this today.  Therefore the blind Jews are truly stupid fools...  Now just behold these miserable, blind, and senseless people.  ...their blindness and arrogance are as solid as an iron mountain.  Learn from this, dear Christian, what you are doing if you permit the blind Jews to mislead you. Then the saying will truly apply, "When a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into the pit" [cf. Luke 6:39]. You cannot learn anything from them except how to misunderstand the divine commandments...  Therefore be on your guard against the Jews, knowing that wherever they have their synagogues, nothing is found but a den of devils in which sheer self-glory, conceit, lies, blasphemy, and defaming of God and men are practiced most maliciously and veheming his eyes on them.  Moreover, they are nothing but thieves and robbers who daily eat no morsel and wear no thread of clothing which they have not stolen and pilfered from us by means of their accursed usury. Thus they live from day to day, together with wife and child, by theft and robbery, as arch-thieves and robbers, in the most impenitent security.  However, they have not acquired a perfect mastery of the art of lying; they lie so clumsily and ineptly that anyone who is just a little observant can easily detect it. But for us Christians they stand as a terrifying example of God's wrath.  If I had to refute all the other articles of the Jewish faith, I should be obliged to write against them as much and for as long a time as they have used for inventing their lies-- that is, longer than two thousand years.  ...Christ and his word can hardly be recognized because of the great vermin of human ordinances. However, let this suffice for the time being on their lies against doctrine or faith.  Did I not tell you earlier that a Jew is such a noble, precious jewel that God and all the angels dance when he farts?  Alas, it cannot be anything but the terrible wrath of God which permits anyone to sink into such abysmal, devilish, hellish, insane baseness, envy, and arrogance. If I were to avenge myself on the devil himself I should be unable to wish him such evil and misfortune as God's wrath inflicts on the Jews, compelling them to lie and to blaspheme so monstrously, in violation of their own conscience. Anyway, they have their reward for constantly giving God the lie.  No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants.  ...but then eject them forever from this country. For, as we have heard, God's anger with them is so intense that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse and worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them!  Over and above that we let them get rich on our sweat and blood, while we remain poor and they suck the marrow from our bones.  I brief, dear princes and lords, those of you who have Jews under your rule-- if my counsel does not please your, find better advice, so that you and we all can be rid of the unbearable, devilish burden of the Jews, lest we become guilty sharers before God in the lies, blasphemy, the defamation, and the curses which the mad Jews indulge in so freely and wantonly against the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, this dear mother, all christians, all authority, and ourselves. Do not grant them protection, safe-conduct, or communion with us.... .With this faithful counsel and warning I wish to cleanse and exonerate my conscience.  Let the government deal with them in this respect, as I have suggested. But whether the government acts or not, let everyone at least be guided by his own conscience and form for himself a definition or image of a Jew.  However, we must avoid confirming them in their wanton lying, slandering, cursing, and defaming. Nor dare we make ourselves partners in their devilish ranting and raving by shielding and protecting them, by giving them food, drink, and shelter, or by other neighborly acts.  Therefore we Christians, in turn, are obliged not to tolerate their wanton and conscious blasphemy.  Accordingly, it must and dare not be considered a trifling matter but a most serious one to seek counsel against this and to save our souls from the Jews, that is, from the devil and from eternal death.  What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews? Since they live among us, we dare not tolerate their conduct, now that we are aware of their lying and reviling and blaspheming. If we do, we become sharers in their lies, cursing and blaspemy. Thus we cannot extinguish the unquenchable fire of divine wrath, of which the prophets speak, nor can we convert the Jews. With prayer and the fear of God we must practice a sharp mercy to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames. We dare not avenge ourselves. Vengeance a thousand times worse than we could wish them already has them by the throat. I shall give you my sincere advice:  First to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians. For whatever we tolerated in the past unknowingly - and I myself was unaware of it - will be pardoned by God. But if we, now that we are informed, were to protect and shield such a house for the Jews, existing right before our very nose, in which they lie about, blaspheme, curse, vilify, and defame Christ and us (as was heard above), it would be the same as if we were doing all this and even worse ourselves, as we very well know.  Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies. This will bring home to them that they are not masters in our country, as they boast, but that they are living in exile and in captivity, as they incessantly wail and lament about us before God.  Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them...  Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb. For they have justly forfeited the right to such an office by holding the poor Jews captive with the saying of Moses (Deuteronomy 17 [:10 ff.]) in which he commands them to obey their teachers on penalty of death, although Moses clearly adds: "what they teach you in accord with the law of the Lord." Those villains ignore that. They wantonly employ the poor people's obedience contrary to the law of the Lord and infuse them with this poison, cursing, and blasphemy. In the same way the Pope also held us captive with the declaration in Matthew 16 [:18], "You are Peter," etc., inducing us to believe all the lies and deceptions that issued from his devilish mind. He did not teach in accord with the word of God, and therefore he forfeited the right to teach.  Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside, since they are not lords, officials, tradesmen, or the like. Let they stay at home...  Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping. The reason for such a measure is that, as said above, they have no other means of earning a livelihood than usury, and by it they have stolen and robbed from us all they possess. Such money should now be used in no other way than the following: Whenever a Jew is sincerely converted, he should be handed one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred florins, as personal circumstances may suggest. With this he could set himself up in some occupation for the support of his poor wife and children, and the maintenance of the old or feeble. For such evil gains are cursed if they are not put to use with God's blessing in a good and worthy cause.  Seventh, I commend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam (Gen 3[:19]}. For it is not fitting that they should let us accursed Goyim toil in the sweat of our faces while they, the holy people, idle away their time behind the stove, feasting and farting, and on top of all, boasting blasphemously of their lordship over the Christians by means of our sweat. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants.  But what will happen even if we do burn down the Jews' synagogues and forbid them publicly to praise God, to pray, to teach, to utter God's name? They will still keep doing it in secret. If we know that they are doing this in secret, it is the same as if they were doing it publicly. For our knowledge of their secret doings and our toleration of them implies that they are not secret after all and thus our conscience is encumbered with it before God.  Accordingly, it must and dare not be considered a trifling matter but a most serious one to seek counsel against this and to save our souls from the Jews, that is, from the devil and from eternal death. My advice, as I said earlier, is:  First, that their synagogues be burned down, and that all who are able toss in sulphur and pitch; it would be good if someone could also throw in some hellfire. That would demonstrate to God our serious resolve and be evidence to all the world that it was in ignorance that we tolerated such houses, in which the Jews have reviled God, our dear Creator and Father, and his Son most shamefully up till now but that we have now given them their due reward.  I wish and I ask that our rulers who have Jewish subjects exercise a sharp mercy toward these wretched people, as suggested above, to see whether this might not help (though it is doubtful). They must act like a good physician who, when gangrene has set in, proceeds without mercy to cut, saw, and burn flesh, veins, bone, and marrow. Such a procedure must also be followed in this instance. Burn down their synagogues, forbid all that I enumerated earlier, force them to work, and deal harshly with them, as Moses did in the wilderness, slaying three thousand lest the whole people perish. They surely do not know what they are doing; moreover, as people possessed, they do not wish to know it, hear it, or learn it. There it would be wrong to be merciful and confirm them in their conduct. If this does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs, so that we do not become partakers of their abominable blasphemy and all their other vices and thus merit God's wrath and be damned with them. I have done my duty. Now let everyone see to his. I am exonerated."  My essay, I hope, will furnish a Christian (who in any case has no desire to become a Jew) with enough material not only to defend himself against the blind, venomous Jews, but also to become the foe of the Jews' malice, lying, and cursing, and to understand not only that their belief is false but that they are surely possessed by all devils. May Christ, our dear Lord, convert them mercifully and preserve us steadfastly and immovably in the knowledge of him, which is eternal life. [1] +dvd
Another pearl from Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming and David Silver+P+Having owned the videotape of this offering from Dr. Yang, I was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the DVD.   I was very satisfied with the information offered on the VHS tape, but having already owned the material, it didn't make sense to purchase a DVD unless there was something added to the material.    Generally, when a company releases a DVD of a previously released VHS tape, there is very little added to the DVD release.    Fortunately, in line with the high quality of YMAA publications, this DVD has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original VHS.   Combine this with the ease of access that a DVD offers and the Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD becomes even more of a bargain.  The video offers material and instruction for the following:  The Taijiquan Thirteen Postures  The Fundamental 8 Stances  Taiji Qigong, with stretching and three sets taught  The Yang Style Taijiquan sequence (The long form)  The video also has an extensive lecture on Taijiquan Theory by Dr. Yang as well as a demonstration of Fa Jing and a list of all the movements of the long form.  The lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn Taijiquan.   Merely imitating the postures and movements, which sadly is how many people practice Taijiquan, without an understanding of the philosophy from which Taijiquan developed, would severely limit one's experience.  Dr. Yang discusses how Taiji is between Wuji (nothingness) and yin and yang.  This concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of Taijiquan.    When you begin the form, you should stand in a beginning posture which represents Wuji, or nothingness/emptiness, during which you settle the body, relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this Wuji state.  Then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the Taiji (which came from the Wuji) splits into the yin and yang.   The dead hands and body, maximum yin, become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang, along with the whole body.   Now the form begins.      I see many practitioners walk up, stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from.   The transition from Wuji to Taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of Taijiquan.  Dr. Yang points out that Taiji, the theory of which is explained so well in this video, has been around for approximately four thousand years, whereas Taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years.    The use of this theory in Daoism is also explained by Dr. Yang.    The link between Taijiquan and Daoism  through their mutual use of the philosophy of Taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning Taijiquan.  Dr. Yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of Taijiquan and the laws of physics.   This lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video.   Too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered.   This video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn Taijiquan.  Throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the Taijiquan Qigong.    The demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol.      I would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this DVD.   A wonderful addition to Dr. Yang's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the VHS version of this video. +dvd
The STRONG should PROTECT the WEAK--or  slaying the "judicial/bureaucratic" Goliaths!+P+Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic "David", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury.   The above is past history...just mentioned in the film.   It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years,  ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens  as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help.   He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around,   ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the "Goliaths" he goes up against.    However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case.    Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving.      His Goliaths include:  The biased, hostile Judge, the "Prince of Darkness" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye,  ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage.    Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian "Good Samaritan" story seriously.    My family caution:  There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene.     The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict.    Will they go with the letter of the law?  Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...)   (Hint of spoiler below)   My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury  who could see the spirit of the law!    Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared  (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude)    to merely ask for a second look at the whole case.  Meanwhile, Terri slowly starved to death...Shame on us! Shades of Nazi Eugenics!!!  +dvd
This film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel.+N+There's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it's mostly emotional. It's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did.  I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely.   Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven't read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn't the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester's "issues", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film.   So, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I'd highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don't forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you've read the novel: it'll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.+dvd
Iconographic Performances In Memorable Comedy-Drama+P+MGM's 1932 GRAND HOTEL, which featured an all-star cast in a series of interweaving plotlines set against a glamorous Berlin hotel, was a tremendous success, and the studio wasted no time in acquiring DINNER AT EIGHT, a popular Broadway show by George S. Kauffman and Edna Ferber that had much the same concept and which could be given the same all-star treatment.  When New York society matron and relentless social climber Millicent Jordan has the opportunity to host a dinner for members of the English aristocracy, she determines to go all out--and the film follows the lives of her soon-to-be guests over the course of a week.  Millicent (Billie Burke) is unaware that husband Oliver (Lionel Barrymore) faces both a business and medical crisis.  Oliver's friend Carlotta (Marie Dressler), a stage star of yesteryear, has sold her stock in Oliver's company--which allows loudmouth business tycoon Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) the chance to cash in at Oliver's expense.  By coincidence, Packard's wife Kitty (Jean Harlow) is having an affair with Oliver's doctor, Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe)--and if this were not complication enough, Oliver and Millicent's daughter Paula (Madge Evans) is on the verge of provoking a social scandal via an affair with aging and alcoholic movie star Larry Renault (John Barrymore.)  And all of them are invited to dine.  DINNER AT EIGHT is usually described as a comedy, and it is true that there are several notable comic performances.  The most famous of these are Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow, who give outrageous performances as the bickering Packards; Billie Burke and Marie Dressler also score as the harried hostess and the retired actress whose charms are long gone.  Where comedy is concerned, DINNER AT EIGHT plays extremely, extremely well and can hold its own with even the best of 1930s comedy--but in truth the movie is more of a drama than a comedy, and where drama is concerned it shows its age in no uncertain terms.  For one thing, the script relies a great deal on coincidence.  This adds to the fun where comedy is concerned, but it works less well for drama, and in DINNER AT EIGHT the neatness with which the parallel plots link to each other is a bit too pat.  For antoher thing, there is a clash of style between the film's comic and dramatic moments, most particularly in terms of the John Barrymore sequences, where the acting seems excessively stagey.  Instead of seamless, the various elements tend butt against each other in a slightly awkward way.  Even so, and whether your taste runs to acid-tongued comedy, broad melodrama, or wild farce, DINNER AT EIGHT offers a great deal to enjoy.  The performances are first rate, with the comic moments a true delight; there is dark irony in John Barrymore's performance; and the set designs and costuming are nothing short of iconographic: it is impossible to think of Jean Harlow, for instance, without envisioning her against a white-on-white Modern bedroom--and that, and a great deal more, comes straight out of this film.  Although the film has not been remastered, the print and sound are extremely good, and bonus features include a very good documentary on Jean Harlow, who more or less steals the show from her numerous co-stars.  Recommended.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe+dvd
George later hated this series....+N+It's a little known fact but George Peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series, frequently did not get along with his co-stars (particularly Mr.T) and hate the child scripts that Stephen Candell would turn out each week.   It's easy to see why, Two of the actors; Mr.T and Dirk Benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in 1985.  Dwight Schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various TV movies and films, so he at least had some acting talent to speak of, but really the only real star of this series was George Peppard, and his more memmorial TV work should be as the Private Insurance investigator, Benecheck.  +dvd
great way to break up your exercise routine! +P+This DVD offers a nice twist to traditional Pilates movements.  There are a lot of lunges that really get your heart rate up.  Results were noticable in just a few sessions.  A must have for your collection!  +dvd
Shallow+N+This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.  Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale.+dvd
Fails to come to a boil+N+Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel.  Lumi Cavazos is a likeable Tita,struggling with her forbidden passion for Pedro.She's a sympathetic character&conveys her pain with her eyes.For a talented actress,I wonder what has become of her since.  Marco Leonardi is not as sympathetic as Pedro.He comes across as a cheating scoundrel,causing pain for both his wife&his forbidden lover.One wonders why Tita loves him so much,except that it's forbidden.Marco Leonardi is,however,being true to the book.He uses Tita for his own pleasure;instead of bravely marrying her,he is a coward in marrying her sister&cheating on her.  The movie renders less magical,or powerful,the scenes in the book.Instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti Western.One expects to see John Wayne riding to Tita's rescue.  The magical scenes are hardly convincing,even for their time.The movie does have an excellent soundtrack.It's far inferior to the delectable,sensual novel+dvd
Not Even Worth Finishing+N+Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it+dvd
What in the Hell is this? this deserves no stars what so ever!+N+One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed+dvd

Pop culture classic+P+One of the greatest teen movies of all times. If you were in high school during the 80s, you've seen it. The movie is real, funny and a timeless classic.   I must admit there is a bit of a lull about 3/4 through, after the abortion, but other than that the movie is perfect.  If you haven't seen it lately, check it out and you'll start to remember high school again like it was yesterday. Need more - check out the book.+dvd

Welles has lost it+N+Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his "cleverness" is off the deep end.   This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles.  He's so proud of how clever he is.  But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings.   In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious.   In this film he beats you over the head with the "subtext" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line.   I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it.  I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist.   Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie+dvd
The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...+N+The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released+dvd
"Who would want to kill the sweetest ****** woman in the world?"+N+I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack+dvd
Utterly amazing thriller!+P+Wow! This movie really exceeded my expectations.  Unfortunately, this movie does not get the credit it so much deserves. Berry put one of her best performances into this film. The plot is superb, the scenes are very convincing, and the plot-twist at the end is brilliant!  This movie is much better than your average thriller and one of my favorites that I have seen in the past few years. This movie is void of predictability or any formulaic format, which makes it such a refreshing thriller.  Don't listen to the negative reviews on this film, they don't know what they're talking about! Remember: If you see this movie with a friend, make sure you can hold on tight to him/her because you'll need someone+dvd
Couldn't have destroyed the story worse...+N+I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.    See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.  Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!  Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too.    Read the book, don't watch the movie.  You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story+dvd
Came because of Sela Ward.  Stayed because it was a phenomenal show+P+There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list.       I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally.    Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O&A's debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show.    I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic.  Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise.     Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance.      The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember.     Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily.  Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes.   While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O&A, I disagree.   Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better.     The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail.    And best of all - everything about this show was real.    Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required.      Perhaps the best thing I can say about O&A is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans).     While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O&A during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story+dvd
excellant for all ages but thanks kathy for tackling the menopause!+P+I've worked out with Kathy Smith videos for years. I'm about the same age as her and was delighted when she tackled the subject of the menopause. It is a very postive dvd and it made me feel empowered.   I do work out regularly and found the cardio a bit too easy for me but will definately use it on days when I feel a bit tired. I would definately recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers of any age. The workouts are short and therefore easy to fit in when busy.+dvd
A Sleeper (literally)+N+This movie was so bad, I fell asleep watching it in the theatre. I normally like Buddy Films, but this one was just plain bad. The jokes were horrible, the acting was worse. Reality TV fits into this movie seamlessly, which is probably another reason why I didn't enjoy it. I think "Reality" programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business. To sum it all up, save your money, I'm sure you can find a better way to spend it+dvd
0 STARS:  LORD HAVE MERCY!!!+N+"The Church" is nonsensical rubbish.  I know Dario Argento is weak on plot, but this movie is absurd.  It's interesting how Argento does such a good job with a movie like "Suspiria" creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky; but, with "The Church", the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present, and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is...the result is a disaster!!  Indeed, there is zero character development, horrendous acting, monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay, all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called "The Church".  This movie is trash...PERIOD!  STAY AWAY!!!!+dvd
Love this movie+P+"When Harry Met Sally" is one of my favorite films.  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it.  Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles.  I can't recommend this movie enough. +dvd
How wonderful to see Womyn of all ages, sizes and colors showing their True Beauty!+P+I really liked this DVD.  I already enjoy belly dancing for my husband and this DVD teaches sexy moves that can easily be combined with belly dance moves to seduce your man.  Here are some perfect examples of bellydancing and striprteasing combinations.  1.  Using wrist circles, which is one of the most basic belly dance moves, to emphasize hip movements when stripping.  2.  Facing away from your lover, go from another basic belly dancing move, snake arms, into a striptease move, hugging yourself.  3.  While doing a hip drop, a belly dancing move, do a sensual slide, a striptease move.  And the 'ol bump and grind is identical to a hip circle!  Ah, the fine art of seduction!  Not to mention shoulder shinnies, which I still can't seem to do at all well,  How frustrating!  My only criticism is the end part where the striptease is demonstrated is MUCH to long.  Plus, it wasn't neccessary to include the lovemaking scene.  A little more instruction on exotic dancing could been substituted, such as lap dancing.                 +dvd
The problem with "Alien Quadrilogy" is that only the first two films worth to be seen.+N+1979 "Alien" by director Ridley Scott and 1986 "Aliens" by director James Cameron, are the only movies of this success Fox franchise, that really were extraordinary films. "Alien" is consider one of the most extraordinary horror movies of all times, mean while "Aliens" is considered one of the best SCI-FI movies of all times. Sadly for the saga, the people of FOX did a very bad job hiring David Fincher to direct "Alien 3" and the French guy Jean-Pierre Jeunet who direct "Aliens resurrection"+dvd
No Captioning+N+WARNING!  This video has no captioning.  I've rented it and it does NOT have captioning.  It is useless to me and fellow Deaf and Hard of Hearing folk+dvd
Navy Heritage - US Navy Seabees+P+This movie has become a part of lore among the men and women of the finest combat contstruction organizations of the US military.  It is a nice Hollywood adaptation of the creation of the US Navy Seabees.  And who can forget the best character in the movie -- Natasha!  It's not often that you see JW's character make the ultimate sacrifice.  I watch this and see the beginning of some traditions and attitudes still in practice today.  &quot;With Compassion for Others, We Build - We Fight, for Peace with Freedom,&quot; from the Seabee Museum. Remember their montra: Seabee Can-Do+dvd
Two Sweet-Azz Movies+P+These were my two favorite movies to watch on those all night parties back when I was in school, something good to have on in the background.  Dazed & Confused -- The year is 1976.  It's the last day of school, and it's time for the new seniors to do some hazing on the new freshmen!  Paddling the guys with those wooden boards, and making the girls look like fools.  Now that's that done, we spend the rest of the movie drivin around, getting dazed and confused;  hanging out at the pool hall;  and trying to find a party to go to.    Fast Times at Ridgemont High -- The year is 1982.  Sex, Drugs, and Rock n' Roll is the story of this movie.  Jeff Spicoli is a surfer dude who always being harrassed by his scrict teacher:  Mr. Hand.  The teacher won't even let Spicoli enjoy a pizza that he ordered in class;  no respect for stoners.    We've got other characters like Brad Hamilton who's having a hard time finding himself in his senoir year, going from job to job - but he does find a cute girl swimming topless in a pool (played by Pheobe Cates).  His sister explores her sexual life.  And of course, we have the nerd.  Like I said before, two awesome partying movies - like the name of the box set says+dvd
The Chameleonic Nature Of Reality+P+How do you take a book as psychologically nuanced and sublte as Whitley Streiber's 'Communion' and translate it into a successful film? Judging by the reception it received in theaters across America upon its '89 release and again by the numerous negative reviews here on Amazon.com the answer appears to be you don't.  I guess I'll have to disagree with the majority consensus. In my opinion director Philipe Mora has done an admirable job in visualizing Mr. Streiber's disquieting, otherwordly visions, providing us with a disturbing glimpse into the world of UFO's and their occupants.  Much of the disappointment and animosity expressed towards this film is due to the ambigious nature of the UFO phenomenon and the directors insistence on leaving it that way. To try and pin down or label psychic experiences is to lose forever the essence of these primal encounters. In such matters we can only ask the questions fully knowing we will never receive the final, definitive answer. Are they from outer space, or someplace much closer to home? It is left for the viewer to decide+dvd
Back Away From Alice!+N+This movie should have won an Oscar.  The acting was superb.  Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson were so convincing as lesbians.  Their common interest of Jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians, but them (of course), is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes.  The writing is amazing.  The nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more.  Stockard Channing was aspiring as a pyschologist.  She made me feel like I could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant.  The stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life.  The twists and turns provided in The Three Sisters story was like a M Night Shyamalan movie.  I won't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise!    All in all I feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss.  With dialogue like two men saying (...) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like Alice or Claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - I feel like I should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber+dvd
I Want My MTV!+N+If MTV was smart, and they used to be, along with funny, relevant, and entertaining (they even played music videos all the time!) It was on all day in my house, and you could always count on the VJs passing along some wacky facts, or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently. Anyway, MTV could make their massive video catalog available to the public. You could browse online and choose the videos you wanted, pay $2-$3 each and MTV would either create a custom DVD for you and send it out, or you could download them and make your own DVDs. I would gladly pay to have several DVDs that contained only the videos I wanted. And there are about 100 I want, just off the top of my head.   As it is, I am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on VH1 Classic, rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos, 4 of which I may want, the rest I don't. This one did nothing for me. Luckily it was a gift. I never would've bought it for myself+dvd
PEYTON PLACE (1957) is a movie to treasure+P+I think it is the Americana montages that make the Jerry Wald/Mark Robson production of PEYTON PLACE (1957, Fox) my favorite small-town America soap opera of all time.  Grace Metalious' scuzzy and scandalous best-selling novel has been carefully adapted by John Michael Hayes (REAR WINDOW and other 1950's Hitchcock gems).  Hampered by censorship that would not allow Selena (Oscar nominee Hope Lange) to have an abortion, it becomes a secret miscarriage and a public appendectomy.  Sex scenes become romantic kisses in a vertical position.  This is one movie that was actually improved by censorship that forced producer Wald, director Robson, and writer Hayes (all Oscar nominees here) to get more creative.  The movie garnered nine Oscar nominations in all, lost all of them in the finals to either THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI or SAYONARA, and was a box office blockbuster that vastly improves on the trashy novel.  (CAUTION--PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!) Partially filmed in Camden and other very scenic coastal Maine locations, PEYTON PLACE opens with first-person narration by very likeable heroine Allison Mackenzie (Oscar nominated newcomer Diane Varsi) about the beauty of the seasons in her town.  She is then seen having a hasty breakfast with Mom Constance (Best Actress Oscar nominee Lana Turner) before she runs off to high school.  Seeming drifter Mike Rossi (Lee Phillips) arrives by car in town and witnesses the son of brutal Lucas Cross (Oscar nominee Arthur Kennedy) and wife Nellie (Betty Field) leave home.  Nellie works as the Mackenzie maid.  Lucas is the alcoholic school janitor.  One of my favorite scenes is a montage of Allison running through backyards and the woods to get to high school, backed by one of Franz Waxman's loveliest scores and William Mellor's beautiful use of CinemaScope.    At school, Mildred Dunnock (Miss Thornton) teaches twelfth grade and is expected to be the new Principal.  But Mike Rossi becomes the new school Principal.  We also meet other school board members, including kindly town doctor Doc Swain (Lloyd Nolan in a career performance) and Harrington (Leon Ames), who runs a textile mill that is the town's biggest industry.  In Miss Thornton's classroom, we also meet nice guy male hero Norman Page (Oscar nominee Russ Tamblyn).  So in just the first reel, we are introduced to almost all of the major characters.  Norman and Allison are an appealing central couple.  Radiating out from them are Selena and David Nelson, Constance and Mike Rossi (whose book sex scenes are reduced to forced kisses), and bad girl Betty Anderson (Terry Moore) and Harrington's horny son Rodney (Barry Coe) for more dramatic tension and later misunderstandings.  (PLOT SPOILERS-BEWARE!)  The rest of a well-paced and engrossing film masterpiece follows these different couples all over town for 157 minutes.  Selena gets raped by her stepfather Lucas, resulting in the miscarriage that is publicly called an appendectomy.  Allison wants to be a writer.  David Nelson wants to be a lawyer.  Since the time period here is World War Two, Norman and Rodney both go off to fight overseas.  There is a beautiful high school dance to Auld Lang Syne and an exquisite montage of boats on Maine's Penobscot Bay and the glory of Summer after a nostalgic high school graduation.    There is also an extended sequence in the film's middle for Labor Day that rivals Labor Day in PICNIC (1955) as the finest ever put on film-singers, school parades, watermelon and hot dogs.  When Constance and Mike watch a man put a ship into a bottle, then share a lobster dinner on the bay, backed by Waxman's music, PEYTON PLACE comes very close to being my favorite movie of all time.  There is also "Beautiful Dreamer" and rowboats on one river, and two very different couples swimming in a lake outside of Peyton Place, leading to a major misunderstanding.  That 20 minute Labor Day sequence is unforgettably evocative, but followed by something gripping and Allison leaving town to become a professional writer. . The climax of PEYTON PLACE, roughly the last half hour of 157 minutes, is a court trial.  I won't tell you who is on trial or for what-we have to have some surprises left in this review-but it has Lloyd Nolan's greatest scene as Doc Swain and a satisfying ending.  The finale to the movie is one of my all-time favorites (PARTIAL PLOT SPOILER).  The final shot is exquisite and euphoric for me, with Allison's voice-over: "We finally discovered that Season of Love. It is only found in someone else's heart.  Right now, someone is looking everywhere for it, and it is in you," with two children riding bikes down a shaded Maine street and Waxman's gorgeous score again.  (NINE Oscar nominations, but not one for the unforgettably beautiful music score?!)  The 1957 Wald/Robson PEYTON PLACE, acted and written to perfection, is a soap opera masterpiece with a very compelling and rewarding plot and some of the most beautiful Americana montages ever put on film.  The DVD sells for only $14.95, with audio commentary by surviving cast members Tamblyn and Moore, restored color, lovely remastered music, and glorious CinemaScope letterboxing after decades of cropped pan/scan images.  You can finally appreciate William Mellor's use of color and use of wide screen on a movie heavily filmed on both coastal Maine locations (including a lockout mountain scene that is awesome) and the Fox backlot in what is now Los Angeles' Century City.  Most of all is a perfect cast down to the bit roles, under Mark Robson's skillful direction.  PEYTON PLACE, one of my ten favorite movies ever, is a must-see and must-own on DVD when you have a three hour time slot.  Actually longer than 157 minutes because of a 30 minute behind-the-scenes featurette, newsreels, and a theatrical trailer (so you can see how the movie was promoted).  (...) +dvd
THIS is the review I wish I'd read before buying+N+I looked at the name (Groovaloos) and I looked at the cover -- and my gut told me not to get this DVD. I went against my gut and believed the reviews; I wish I'd listened to my gut. For those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey, you're right on the money. They can all dance, but compared to what I expected, they seemed mediocre. Here's the lowdown: (1) the sound sucks - they're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine, but the music isn't loud enough to really "feel" something that makes you want to move, (2) they just seem like a group of people who don't naturally have a rhythm, but they've learned some moves; it's SO not inspiring, (3) it's not edgy enough, and (4) it looks good if you've got a group doing it, but when someone's doing it alone, it's just okay. Overall, this DVD was okay, but not great. Get it only if you're truly desperate+dvd
hit hit hit+P+I own every season of I love lucy..this is another hit. great characters, funny storylines..great punchlines..I love i+dvd
Weak content dooms Guitar Demon+N+I consider Buckethead a unique artist with an original vision.  The manifestation of that vision on his 13th Anniversary DVD, while intriguing and amusing, is for only his most devoted, hard-core fans.    I've liked some of his stuff on YouTube, and saw the DVD by chance passing through a cd/dvd store in a mall and took a chance.  Bad decision.  I can go along with the "Cheapo Depot" look and vibe, but when it comes down to delivering content, this is a bloated, nearly unwatchable video.  The content is presented in two disks, but it should have been one.  The live concert material on disk 2 looks as if shot on consumer grade video cameras, featuring Bucket playing along to pre-recorded tracks, doing the robot, and a display of his num-chucks skills.  The music, speed-rock with doses of country chicken pickin and classical flavors, sounds largely the same from song to song.  Frankly, I was bored.  The is an experiment gone wrong.  His over-the-top Dr. Phibes meets Yngvie meets the dark side of Disney is realized as an unfocused mess on this package.  The result it had on me is that I am unlikely to buy another DVD or song from him without checking into reviews first, so buyer beware.  Memo to Buckethead: find someone to focus your vision and move on to the next phase of your career+dvd
What any TRUE Buckethead fan would expect/want...+P+Simply put, I bought this, brought it home, and spent the wee hours of the night smiling on the couch as the one and only Buckethead filled my living room with his unique brand of guitar-shred-funk-fusion-dementia. This dvd is a trip, from the wacked out menus to the oodles of content that cover his whole career so far...videos (Praxis!), discography (you think you have it all, but I assure you, you don't), and a bonus dvd with 2 live shows (it doesn't hurt that I can see myself in the Boston one, laughing like a goon as he hands out toys). There's just tons of bucketgoodies hiding in here. This dude is just the whole package-Eddie Van Halen and Eddie Hazel all in one, mixed with Leatherface and The Shape. So rad. This dvd definitely had a lot of time and creativity put into it, so to anyone who doesn't enjoy this for the perfect representation of the Bucketman that it is, you simply be missin' the point. Might I suggest you stick to your Dream Theater/Satriani/G3 dvd's, you 5.1 Surround sound obsessed prog-metal nerds...you don't like chickens, get out the coop+dvd
Sorry+N+This movie is so freakin stupid. Yes its funny...but so very dumb. Not good dumb; bad dumb. Terribly, painfully stupid. Funny at times. Best avoided or taken in small doses+dvd
Funny+P+Saw this movie on cable and it was so funny to my fiance' and I that I went to Amazon and bought it.  I do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it+dvd
My advice, watch 'Get Shorty' instead+N+The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.    A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.    Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.  My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.'+dvd
loved the workout years ago, loe the DVD+P+Leisa Hart is by far the best STEEL instructor, i have always loved her style and consider her my own personal trainer when using her videos. she is charming and genuine, a real woman. i love her new videos like Gym In A Box and the Core Series and can't wait for her Sexy Series. She is a great teacher and can help anyone, even witha ten yr old video+dvd
War Movie classic+P+Great movie for WWII buffs.  One of the best submarine movies in my opinion.  However, people who are not hard core war movie viewers will likley find it too slow and boring.  They did a great job getting it on DVD+dvd
Such a bad movie they made a second!+N+The first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting. Perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus. This is not an original plotline, but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl, as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her step-brother. Take that for what its worth. There was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie, but then the second movie is not worth it at all. It was a B movie... which is why it went straight to video. If your a frustrated teen boy, you will love this movie for its sexual content. Otherwise, it is greatly overacted and over dramatic+dvd
The Duke takes the burden of aerial command in WWII+P+John Wayne stars in this thoroughly entertaining film about Marine WWII pilots. The Duke takes command and drives his men hard to accomplish the mission of close air support - a very dangerous endeavor. While his XO does not agree with his methods, he does come to appreciate them later on.  Flying Leathernecks includes some excellent real combat footage from WWII, which adds a nice touch of authenticity. The characters and dialogue will engage the viewer, and really help keep the plot moving along.   If you like the movie Flying Tigers, or other WWII aviation films then you will enjoy this one. Or, if you simply like the Duke in military films, then this one is also worth viewing.+dvd
Horrendous+N+Clive Barker did a good job on the original Candyman. It was truly a cut above most horror movies. The second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous. There is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable. Donna D'Errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks. Lets hope this is the last sequel+dvd
Its a good action movie+P+I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story.  It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie.  Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows.  Still it is worth looking at.  +dvd
As good as the real thing+P+When I heard that Incubus was going to put out a live DVD from their 2004 Summer Tour I was estatic. This is one of the few music DVDs that captures the entire concert to a tee. How do I know? I saw Incubus at the Lawlor Event Center in Reno on this tour. It was amazing, and so is the DVD. Buy it+dvd
In-credible, make yourself by this....+P+...the fact that out of 19 reviews 17 are 5star says alot about this DVD. Im not going to go off on one about this as i dont have time to (i know i'd get carried away as theres so much to comment on this) but basically i thought the Morning View Sessions were a good demonstration of Incubus live, Volume 2 is great, especially the live Cali-accoustic tracks (awesome) but this concert is unbelievable, so so good! Highlights for me are for a start seeing alot of the Crow Left of the Murder tracks live as the album is brilliant & has grown on me so much over time, but also just seeing how well Incubus can improvise & adapt their songs to sound even better live. Theres a great version of "Drive" here, but the lengthened versions of "Sick, Sad Lille world" & "A certain shade of Green" are amazing. The guitar work on "S,S L W", "Priceless" & "Pistola" is brilliant. Other greatly performed trackes include "Wish you were here" (such an anthem nowadays), "Here in my room", "Made for TV movie" (a new favourite of mine) & "Talk shows on mute". also very cool to see "Pantomine" live, its also on the bonus CD, along with a couple live tracks & a couple of non-album tracks.  im hoping to get to the Leeds festival this summer (if i can blag a ticket somehow) so very much looking forward to seeing them even if it is only for an hour! Theyre the best band in the world in my opinion.  Basically buy this if you love incubus, its the best DVD you can get of them...+dvd
The world's full of lonely people+N+Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played.  He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end.  Here was no acception.  He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college.  Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place.  While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached.  While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy.  The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that.  Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight.  What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires.  He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with.  I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head.  Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving.  That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one.    I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words.  Still, it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people+dvd
Should have been PG 13+N+I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.+dvd
A film that you already seen before+N+"Killing Me Softly" has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big "twist" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly  In spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous "** out of 5" rating. But if you're a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks.+dvd
How can you be brainwashed by your own mother?+P+A rather melodramatic rewriting of a plot that could have been produced by Tennessee Williams. The black widow of a mother who only lives and marries to get a son and put her hands on a big agricultural - or so - estate will not hesitate to kill and then she brainwashes her own son into believing his father died in some kind of an accident. What happens when this son gets married and is expecting a child from his newly wed wife ? The attachment of the son to his mother is shown as perverse and leading to the rejection of the wife, of the mother of the baby to come. Then it melodramatically develops into a new criminal affair and the son finds then the courage, in the name of his wife and child, to break off and go. There is something incestuous and insane in this mother and the film sounds sad and unhappy, in spite of the positive ending. A son, a man, a human being in general cannot live as a human being if he or she rejects his or her parents utterly. This is hatred and hatred is nothing but the perversion of love and hatred makes love impossible. A man or woman who hates cannot love anyone properly and rejects herself or himself out of society. Hatred is psychotic and leads, sooner or later, to murder and death.  Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne+dvd
"Rockin' from the Delta to the DMZ!"+P+Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon.  Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other.  Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour ("What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery."). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different.  Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh.  Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities.  This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part "Production Diary" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found.  "Raw Monologues" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations.  Finally, there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers+dvd
Just plain boring, and totally overhyped. CONTAINS SPOILERS!!+N+In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now".  Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results.  To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids.  So it's David Cronenberg. So what?  Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown.   Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good.  In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema.  A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext?  I couldn't.+dvd
Worst Movie I've Ever Seen (exept "I Am The Cheeze")+N+I was in the Army when this came out, working on helicopters.  I saw the movie at Travis AFB in California....well, as much as I saw.  I DID walk out of the theatre.  Even yelling quips at all of the cheezy lines (and there are plenty) wasn't entertainment enough to keep me from screaming at my shoes.  I left fuming and spent the next hour waiting in a cold M1008 for the rest of my buddies to get done watching it.  I'm sickened watching Nicholas Cage to this very day+dvd
a poorly edited documentary; story misses the mark+N+I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one.+dvd
whiney, alcoholic, aging hippie makes ass of himself in another culture+N+I hate to be the only one to say it. but this movie sucked.  It's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to Tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational.  This movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful.   The main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass.  He manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in Tuva, and in one instance hands an unsuspecting Tuvan a joint.  Not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well.  But its hard to take since Paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed.  But paul isnt the only ass of this documentary.  He also has help from his Friends of Tuva and the filmers.  if there is any value in watchings this piece of @#*# its in what not to do when you visit other countries.  Seriously, one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there.  From that character's earlier appearences in the film, i would have to say that he  would have deserved it.  The only thing going for this movie is photage of acual Tuvan's singing.  Im so sorry they had to meet this guy.  If you do decide to get this don't forget to watch the interview with the directors.  Thats definately the best part.  Ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before, but this two are like charactures of them.  if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing The Journey Of Man+dvd
Shoulda Been A Star+P+Good action movie.  I actually saw this in the theater(yes, it did have a theatrical release!) back in the day.  This was about the time when cheap action and horror films were starting to disappear from theaters.  Excessive Force would be straight to video if released today.  Pity, coz it's pretty fun.  Thomas Ian Griffth never became the next Seagal or VanDamme-something the producers were obviously trying to do with him-but he really does the action tough guy thing wonderfully.  He even had a hand in the script.  He's got the look and the moves, he's even a decent actor.  He went on to do some direct to video action pics, and played the lead vampire in John Carpenter's Vampires.  You may also remember him as one of the villians from Karate Kid III(the guy who teaches Daniel how to break noses).  Other than that, the guy is virtually unknown.  The plot doesn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of cops/robbers action, but it's a cliched film done well.  It's got a better than average supporting cast of James Earl Jones, Lance Henriksen, Tony Todd(the Candyman himself!), and Burt Young(Paulie from the Rocky movies).  These guys must have also seen potential of the script to want to appear in it.  Good supporting actors, a good script, and a good performance from the lead raise this  otherwise by-the-numbers action movie up a few notches to something quite entertaining+dvd
Where is Deadtime Stories??!!!+N+I bought this set just for that movie and IT'S NOT ON HERE!! Why?! I am so mad+dvd
Not good...+N+Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..+dvd
its ok but I gave it away+N+Although I love the Firm, this one is not my favorite.It is a good workout,there is just something about it...it drags.Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know.At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like.It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way+dvd
Failure+N+It's well known that 'Showgirls' flopped. I remember director Paul Verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year'.  It's not hard to point out its failure: the young & attractive lead Elizabeth Berkley cannot act. As Elizabeth is in focus quite a lot, her frequent appearance turns 'Showgirls' into disaster.  In hindsight it's incredible that an experienced director like Paul Verhoeven hired someone like her. I guess the blatant display of nudity in Berkley's role, as well as in this whole movie, made better actresses look elsewhere. The more so, while 'Showgirls' theme and plot are somewhat meagre.  One star for the effort, and another for the nice picturing. Any lavish display of female nudity cannot cover the failure of 'Showgirls' concept+dvd
THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE SERIES!+P+I just figured I'd get that out of the way. This is not the entire series as it seems most people are assuming. This is the Complete Collection Part 1. I'm really not sure why it was done this way, but it is so I just want to make sure to avoid any confusion since there seems to be quite a bit.  Wolf's Rain is my single favorite anime to this day and I still watch it as much as anything else in my collection. It is the story of Keba, Hige, Toboe, and Tsume. They are wolves, a creature thought to have been hunted to extinction by humans 200 years ago. There is a legend that when mankind comes to an end, a paradise will decend upon the Earth that only wolves will be able to attain. This is the background for the show as Keba and the others meet and begin a long journey to find paradise. There are a lot of side stories thrown in to keep the viewer on edge including the wolf hunter tracking our heroes, two human scientists who eventually become caught up in the legend of wolves, and an evil empire that wants to open up paradise for their own evil intentions. Eventually everything intertwines and creates the setting for one of the most powerful endings to any show I have ever seen. But in order to see the entire thing, you will either have to wait until the second half of this collection is released or buy the actual box set that does contain the entire series. Either way you choose to do it, you can't go wrong with Wolf's Rain+dvd
Movie review+P+If you're an old movie buff, as I am, I think you will like this one. I have seen it on TV  but it is one for the collection. I have watched it twice already since I got it+dvd
Fantastic animated rendition+P+It's hard to believe, but I never heard of Wind in the Willows until I was about 16 years old, when it was first read aloud to me, around a glowing campfire. It was an instant love affair.  Years later, I shared the classic with my children. So when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor's tag sale, we snapped it up. We've loved the film ever since.  The animal characters--Badger, Mole, Toad, Weasel  and all the others--congregate often at Toad Hall and elsewhere, and the story takes many delightful turns.  This animated version, directed by Dave Unwin, is every bit as classic as the book. Your children will surely love it as much as we did--including the child in this particular mom.  --Alyssa A. Lappe+dvd
A Wonderful Experience Revisited+P+Even though this was one of Prince's underrated movies, I still love it.  The DVD version includes all of the music videos (some in color) that were released in reference to the soundtrack.  This was ingenious for the marketability of this DVD.  Way to go+dvd
Oy Vey.+N+Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination.  Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead?  I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers.  But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal.  And the film design!  Bleh!  Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake.  The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated.    I felt so much dumber after watching this movie.  I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book.  Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites.  I don't know why I thought of that book just now.  I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much+dvd
Challenging and Timeless+P+If you loathe exercise videos in which the instructor is telling you "good job - keep it up - way to go - that looks good" when you know they can't see you, this is an excellent alternative.  Cindy is clear in her instructions, of course her body is inspirational, and she doesn't insult your intelligence.  The video itself is shot in some beautiful locations and the music isn't overbearing. The actual exercise sequences are challenging and continue to be so - even if you use this tape several times a week for a few months like I did.  The best thing about this video is the results - I used this video several years ago and got down to a healthy size 4/6.  I just ordered the DVD version to get me back into shape after having my first baby and can't wait to start this routine again!  +dvd
my first movie review+N+This is the first movie review I have ever written.  I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire.  Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung..  ..  I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate!  No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back...  Hurry, go see it!+dvd
The Book of Acts made interesting and understandable! +P+First, I agree with other reviewers here that the portrayal of Paul the Apostle by Anthony Hopkins is a standout performance worthy of an emmy nomination. Robert Foxworth's Peter is also interestingly done but our information is lacking about his ministry when he disappears after Chapter 7 in the book of Acts. Therefore the movie focuses on Paul's attempt to unite Jew,Greek and Roman in a trinity of new Christian faith and this film delivers on that concept, even though it is somewhat romanticized. Some very effective scenes remind you of "Jesus of Nazareth". One suprise is when Paul is being confronted by his "thorn in the flesh" while consulting with Barnabas and Mark, you hear a mysterious sound that is tough to catch but Mark inquires what it is to which Paul replies "just an animal". (Actually it is a devil). Also there is a great confrontation with the woman who throws her voice into statues and animals to ridicule Paul's ministry. When Paul tells her that she won't have the power to do that again it is effective enough to put a fear of the Lord into you! We get to see the journeys of Paul and Barnabas (you will notice a gradual decline in the richness of Barnabas shown in his clothing) , we meet Luke, Timothy, Silas, Mark and get a basic grip on what the spread of Christianity was all about in the ancient world. Nero's fay behavior will get on your nerves especially when he is engaged in conversations about Paul with his jailer. Paul's triumphant entry as a prisoner into Rome will remind you of Jesus and his entry into Jerusalem so much so that it can bring a tear to your eye. The original scene of Paul forgiving the Axeman when he is beheaded has been removed for some reason on this DVD. Well recommended to anyone who wants some insight into the early development of the Church and to understand persecution of the apostles!+dvd
Yuck+N+I love and "get" John Waters ("Cry Baby", "Hairspray", "Serial Mom" etc)and I love the unique slightly larger than life elevated acting style he demands from his actors. But THIS one left me cold, uncomFARTable and slightly nauseous. I didnt even finish watching it. I decided to rather take a dip in our local sewerage+dvd
Sci Fi that never goes out of style+P+Before buying any Dr Who series you should be aware that the special effects for the most part suck.  However, the general plot is great and the plot lines are exceptional.  This was a must have from my childhood, expecially since it was a Tom Baker (the long scarfed Doctor) series.  I enjoyed thoroughly because it brought to light the creation of one of the Doctors most deadly enemies (the Daleks).  It also contains a few characteristic one liners by Tom Baker. +dvd
Simpler Times+P+Tales of Avonlea is a great film to be enjoyed by children and adults. It takes you back to a more simpler, and innocent time. It will make you laugh and sometimes it will bring tears to your eyes.You will enjoy the adventures that Alex,Felicity, and Sarah take you on. This film was beautifully made! So, sit back and enjoy Tales of Avonlea and beautiful Prince Edward's Island+dvd
Worth watching+P+braced myself when I rented this because I thought it was not going to be very funny - and I was pleasantly surprised. Some parts of it were hilarious - Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfeld) has a medium sized role and is as funny as ever. I was not dissapointed. It's not sophisticated humor, but well worth it for the laughs. Very enjoyable+dvd
Only one reason to watch this film...+N+...and it's staring at you on the video cover.  It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene.  No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense.  It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy.  Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it.  But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her+dvd
Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !!+N+This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort.+dvd
Intriguing and creepy, but Rickman fans will love it anyway+P+The acting is fine, but the story--help!  The problem is not Rickman's or Grant's unsavory characters, but the propensity in too many small, independent British films to present lower-middle class characters as if they were slow.  The message I get from all these films comes across as snobbish: That people are poor in Britain because they are stupid.  But stupidity by itself isn't funny anyway, although that point is lost on producers from both sides of the Ocean.  Here, Cate plays a girl who is more than young and naive as the adverts suggest; she is a mentally handicapped and/or emotionally disturbed girl. (The girl's aunt and uncle are also unpleasantly slow.) Cate plays this very well, but her character becomes creepy and rather repulsive. On the other hand, Rickman's and Grant's reaction to her character is what gives this film its interest.  Rickman seducing Cate's underage character (she doesn't really look it) isn't creepy at all and is the high point of the film, but maybe that's because it's Rickman that does it.  Grant is excellent, playing a different role than usual, and he looks different and slightly goofy here too, a bit like Terry Thomas.  But Rickman fans will not want to miss this movie+dvd
Good Film -- even the guys should like this "chick flick!"+P+Entertaining and fun relationship flick with the outstanding team of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  These two always work great together+dvd
Finally- a Documentary about White Collar Crime+P+This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone+dvd
Loved it over and over again+P+Love this DVD!  Can't say enough about it.  You will love it to, young or old.  Very good technique and fun too+dvd
A beautifully subtle and genuinely emotional film+P+This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith).  I acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd  been permitted to "youthify" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real.  Ciarï¿½n Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised.  The sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless).  The look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed.  The truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.)  To sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is "exciting" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you+dvd
Made-for-TV Rubbish+N+Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it "Rock On with NAWSA"), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: "I'm having dinner with Helen Keller." The reporter, "Don't stare, she hates that."  Yet, I suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music: rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s, it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns. Indeed, one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was "Ain't She Sweet"-- a Roarin' Twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by Paul Ash & His Orchestra at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker.   Alice Paul was hardly a flapper, nor was she an astute poitical strategist. She was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater, much more productive efforts of Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston) and others who had continued the struggle since Seneca Falls in 1848. Catt used Paul's antics to good effect in eventually persuading President Wilson (here, woefully overweight) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the Great War. Paul was at most a footnote in the process.   I showed this film to my Gilded Age-Progressive Era class last spring; consider a few written comments from today's undergraduates: "disjointed" -- "historically inept and emotion-ridden" -- "this was Hilary Swank in INSOMNIA Part 2" -- "numerous historical inaccuracies included women's hair and men's clothing styles from later eras, the misuse of props like a small woman's wrist watch and a Crown Graphic press camera, both of which did not exist in 1918, plus the American flag behind Wilson is hung backwards" -- "the parts where she (Paul/Swank) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by Speiberg, but his was more convincing" & my favorite: "why not really screw it up and throw in a little Helen Reddy at the end?+dvd
What?+N+I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys.  Real life isn't like that.  I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up.  But this is the worst movie I have ever seen. +dvd
Disappointing......... very disappointing+N+The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "Do you believe in Ghosts?"  The "lighter" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet "The Polar Express" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.     +dvd
It's quite surprising how much it holds up+P+Before South Park came on the air and offended practically everybody with cripple fights to cooking parents in chili to saying the S word a record 162 times, there was Beavis and Butthead. Found on MTV, the pair were crude and just plain moronic who laughed at even the mention of dirty words bringing out the popular catchphrase "uh-huh, you said ". After the show ended, the pair got their own movie and became a surprise hit so who would've guessed that it's actually still funny?  Beavis and Butthead are sleeping on their trademark couch which allows a pair of robbers to steal their prized TV. Not wanting to just allow it, they go hunting for it and end up meeting Muddy, a biker who will pay them to "do" his wife, which of course he means kill but they didn't get that part. So he flies them to Vegas to meet her only she sends them to Washington with something particularly interesting and quite dangerous. And of course the hilarity and antics ensue.  Now, the humor seems kind of tame. Buzzards having sex with each other or a topless sphinx probably doesn't have that kneeslapper kick to it like it used to. Not that I mind anyway since even if certain jokes don't work, the whole thing has a very loose and laid-back feeling about it where it doesn't even matter if you're not laughing, you're just glad they're up there. Some jokes, such as the preposition one, Beavis' alter-ego Cornholio are always funny, not to mention Robert Stack's ATF character's love for cavity searches.  Does it have some problems? A bit. The reliance on toilet humor can only go so far and you kind of wanted them to do more America rather than the limited ones we have here. We literally skip over certain states that could've got some good mileage. And while visually impressive, the Rob Zombie inspired freak-out in the desert just doesn't fit (and to be honest: anything involving Rob Zombie and filmmaking just doesn't work). But they're only minor concerns and of course this is a MTV movie - a Beavis and Butthead one nonetheless - so all that stuff gets thrown out the window.  The special features are pretty good but you kind of wish there was more. We have a commentary with Mike Judge and Yvette Kaplan with Mike slipping into character a couple times(not often enough but the mention of his dream involving the movie is hilarious). The featurette is slightly disappointing as while we do get some background and discussion, some of it is either redundant and back-patting or mentioned already in the commentary. But seeing some footage of the VA's, including Mike Judge doing Beavis, Butthead and Mr. Anderson are always awesome.  If you were into the show, this is of course a good place to start. If you weren't, give it a try since this is probably the best launch pad to get into the show+dvd
Big Disappointment+N+I was excited about this DVD because of the customized workout feature, but I couldn't even make it through a preview. The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine.  If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed "Yoga Shakti" by Shiva Rea+dvd
waste of talent, time, and money+N+I had the unfortunate experience of spending money at Blockbuster and renting this dud. With such big name stars, I expected at least a mildly entertaining movie.  What I got was one hour of lifeless, drab, big-budget flick.  I couldn't bear to watch another minute, thus "Tequila Sunrise" became the first rental I stopped watching since that fateful day I rented "Last Action Hero".  The actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes, lending not one iota of believability to their characters.  I'm sure Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson, and Kurt Russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers.  I hope the actors had fun making this production; I sure as heck didn't have any fun watching it+dvd
Rescue Me seasons 1 & 2+P+I love watching the episodes without commercials. This show is the best!+dvd
Watanabe's New Masterpiece+P+Samurai Champloo has become one of the greatest anime series ever with this final volume. It ranks well beside Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe's other masterpiece of anime, and in many ways surpasses it. Watanabe's series, though based in fuedal Japan, does not limit itself to those restrictions, instead taking a surrealistic view of history, which allows for both minor and huge discrepancies, and the larger the lie, the funnier the episode. Along with the comedy, the story centers around great action and even greater music.  But in this volume, drama dominates. All of the characters meet the conclusion of their own personal stories, while wrapping up their story as a group. Jin faces a man directly linked to his past as a swordsman; Mugen faces a family bent on revenge for Mugen's past life as a pirate; and Fuu finally meets the Sunflower Samurai. Though you may think I spoiled it, just watch and see, for none of these endings end exactly as you would expect.   Then, after all three of these linked episodes are finished, you are treated to a Reggae-style rap sung partly in English but mostly in Japanese. To me, this was the perfect ending theme to a series that relied heavily on its music.  So as not to spoil, I'll finish my review saying this. The end of Samurai Champloo is both exciting and a bit sad. It's a perfect conclusion to a perfect anime series, and sufficiently answers all the questions left behind in the previous volumes. If you have any anime sense, then you've already seen this anime and love it. If you don't, then hurry and get this so that you can say you were one of the first to see one of the best. This anime was definitely worth me collecting every separate volume, and I'd recommend the same for anyone else out there. Right now, I'm hoping Watanabe takes the same direction he did with Cowboy Bebop and makes the Samurai Champloo movie+dvd
Film student work+N+My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places.  All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make.  On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went+dvd
Wallace & Gromit RULE!+P+You can't lose with Wallace and Gromit.  Great for the entire famil+dvd
Great for 12-14 year olds+P+This is a very good, contemporary visual text of a resistant fairy-tale. It is a valuable teaching resource for the teaching of writing of this particular type of text. Plus the kids love it and it's a bit of fun!+dvd
Uncut Escaflowne is better than the Fox version+P+The uncut Escaflowne still isn't quite as good as the original with subtitles, but it much better than Fox's version.  Thing make more sense now because Fox was cutting out important scenes.  This series is a must have and this tape is definitely good and with every tape I get the series seems to get better and better+dvd
A silly juvenile film.  A pseudointellectual piece of nonsense.+N+Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism).  The film appeals to naive youth+dvd
Do all films with "Demon" in the title stink?+N+I am a huge Argento fan, but come on folks...this movie just stinks.  There's more corn in this flick than the State of Kansas.  The single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something.  There are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which Argento's uncanny editing and camera work shine.  Otherwise its a feast for the idiots; green blood, bad make-up and all.  Definately not one to purchase for the collection+dvd
A GREAT FILM RUINED+N+HELLO?????  Whoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters.  How can such a thing happen?  If you find the VHS buy it.  Maybe some day someone will make the corrections.  Until then, AVOID this DVD+dvd
Worset movie ever+N+I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!+dvd
...you had me at goodbye...+N+...this movie is at the top of my list...unfortunately, it's the 'worst movie of all-time' list...that's right, ladies and gentlemen, friends and supporters of this film...this movie is trash (and not just for cuba's horribly annoying acting)...it's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable...come on...do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction...it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands...and if all you base a relationship on, is the end justifying the means, well, i wish you luck with your next soul mate..+dvd
Mediocre, at best!+N+I have read "Into Thin Air" and watched the Discovery Channel series on Mt. Everest, so I received this DVD with great anticipation.  However, my excitement dissolved quickly due to the cheesy music, awful special effects, lack of drama, and poor landscape visuals.  I was completely bored.  It was a waste of 45 minutes+dvd
Magnificent transfer by Criterion+P+I am not going to write about the merits of Ran, i.e., it is a given that it is perhaps Kurosawa's finest work. If you bought the previous Masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the Criterion, don't hesitate. The "Masterworks" transfer is a travesty compared to the Criterion. The colors just bleed in the Masterworks, whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant. On the Masterworks DVD there is a restoration demo, which I thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the Criterion. Get this DVD if you are a Kurosawa fan; you won't regret it. This is perhaps the finest Criterion DVD that I have purcased, and I own over 40 Criterions+dvd
The coming home from war movie.+P+I love this movie, it is a must see for anyone who is in the military or is a military family member. It is emotionally charged with issues every military family deals with when the soldier returns from war. Keep a box of tissues handy, I cry everytime I watch it. Eventhough it takes place post WWII, the feelings remain the same for every generation.+dvd
Superb value package+P+If Bette Davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of Hollywood in the Golden Era, she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent. This set, compared to Volume One, which contains obvious Davis hits, covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962. Two favourite Davis films, "The Man Who Came to Dinner" and "Marked Woman" are included.    More detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary:  - "Marked Woman" is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated.  This was the first film Davis made after she walked out of Warner Brothers and was sued for breach of contract.  She lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect. She gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending. - "Jezebel" is the 1938 film for which Davis won her second Oscar, a precursor to "Gone with the Wind" and directed superbly by William Wyler.  The film is a soap opera about a willful Southern girl and would fall into trivia without Davis's subtle performance and Wyler's attention to detail. - "Dark Victory" from 1939 was possibly Davis's favourite role about a Long Island socialite with a brain tumour. The film is a tour de force for Davis who might have won another Oscar if the film had been released in a different year. - "The Man Who Came to Dinner" is an ensemble piece, an excellent version of the 1941 Kaufman and Hart Broadway Hit.  Davis supports Monty Woolley, a character based on Alexander Woolcott, who hilariously dominates the film. - "Old Acquaintance" from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman's picture with Davis starring with rival Miriam Hopkins.  It is a picture which resonated with "woman's issues" in 1943 and was remade in the 80's as "Rich and Famous". - "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is the famous teaming with Joan Crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult (and camp) classic. The film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows.  The extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably, although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about Davis's overanalysed relationship with Joan Crawford. Best of all, the excellent documentary "Stardust: The Bette Davis Story" has been included.  The Collection is great value+dvd
Rattle, Hum & Chill Out+P+I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now.  Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie.  Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the "holy lands" of rock.  If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it.  Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland.  Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written.  By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career.  Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage.  Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride.  It's only rock'n'roll+dvd
Not the best season but still gets the job done+P+Scrubs continues it's trek onward from it's humble beginnings in the third season. The first season revolved around everything from JD coping with being a doctor, to Turk and Carla beginning their relationship, to JD and Elliot's crazy relationship. Season two continued from there and even expanding upon it. JD and Elliot hooked up again. Turk and Carla became even more close. Dr. Cox even gets thrown in the mix a lot more with the storyline of him getting back with Jordan. That brings us to season three. Following up on two tremendous season isn't easy and they, in my opinion, succumb to the pressure somewhat. Of the three seasons released on DVD so far, this season is my least favorite.  Never fear though. Season three still has plenty of laughs, plenty of guest appearances (Michael J. Fox will probably go down as my favorite), and you get to know the entire cast even more. All these things make for a memorable season, but in some cases they seem to have backed themselves into a corner. There's more than a fair share of laughs along the way, be it the janitor becoming a security guard, Cox dealing with his child, Turk and Carla basically becoming one person (funnier than it sounds), Elliot's rekindling flame of season one's Sean, and JD's continued troubles of being a doctor/lover. Everything is funny, just a notch below seasons one and two.  Overall, yes, this could've been better (episode wise, extras are amazing as always), but I'm still happy with what we've been given. The cliffhanger is a good one and I look forward to seeing even more scenarios continued in season four's DVD release+dvd
Old Action Heroes don't die, they just fade away.+N+Instructions: rent Steven Seagall's latest action movie knuckle-fest "Exit Wounds". Insert in DVD player; watch first 15 minutes of movie, remove from DVD player. Return to video store.    If you follow those instructions to the letter, you'll have fun with "Exit Wounds", which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory (Seagall attempts to thwart a brash, brazen assassination attempt).   There's also a great scene---strike that, a Priceless Scene: hipster uber-villain (played convincingly by rapper DMX) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot (ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago, paid for in cash out of a golf bag).  The scene is dope, def, and cool---it's all GOOD, Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way. And that's a shame, really: it's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin, over the course of two hours, to realize that the rest of the movie just can't hold a candle to its opening minutes.   An action movie should be exciting; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President (a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own, and from which 95% of the trailer material was taken), "Exit Wounds" is not exciting.   It's stale. It's rehashed. Honestly, were it not for DMX, the few riffs from the movie's excellent rap soundtrack, and the equipment, I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick. And that's surprising, given that the movie is helmed by "Romeo Must Die" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also did the cinematography for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Devil's Advocate.   The plot, what there is of it, deals with police corruption, and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and doesn't make any sense---but by that time you've stopped caring. You've seen all of this before---done better.  Worst of all, Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero; he's reached that wheezing, shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in "View to a Kill"---except Seagall doesn't have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on. Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs, but the laughs are so feeble, and the jokes so stale, that you're laughing *at* Arnold and Seagall---not with them.   Midway through "Exit Wounds" I was fighting to stay awake, and that's a shame, given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer, hectic energy than any movie I've seen since "Face/Off".   Rent the DVD for that opener if you dare, but if you stay any longer you'll see it's true: Old Action Heroes never die, they just fade away.  JS+dvd
Look out for the Zuni!!!+P+Back in the heyday of Dark Shadows Dan Curtis did some telly movies.  Frankenstein with Robert Foxworth, The Norliss Tapes with Roy Thinnes, The Night Stalker with Darren Mcgavin, Scream of the Wolf with Clint Walker and Peter Graves, then eventually went on to do bigger projects like The Winds of War and War and Remembrance with Robert Mitchum.  During that salad days of the mid 1970s, he did a nifty "novella" style movie called Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black.  He went on to use Black in Burnt Offerings the following year.  It's a three story showcase, displaying the varied talents of Black, but it's in the last one where Curtis breaks out and really does something memorable.    The first novella tale is "Julie".  This tell was never fully fleshed out about a college professor who has dark secrets.  Nice quirky ending keeps this one for being average.  The second is "Millicent and Therese".  After the promise of "Julie", I really expected a bit more from this rather obvious tale.  Is good fun, just nothing special.  Still a fine showcase for Black to show what she can do.  It was just so all totally out there, no twist of the screw to make it more.  "Amelia" The final one is based on Richard Matheson's Prey, and it outstanding.  Once you see these story you will never forget the Zuni warrior that comes to life.  Amelia is totally abused by her possessive and controlling mother.  She tries to break these ties that bind, but she is no match.  She buys a Zuni doll and it comes to life.  No spoiler there.  You can see that by the cover.  It's the story that is amazing.  Black's ending is original and memorable.  This was low budget telly movie remember, so accept the quality  as not motion picture level.  Still a GREAT Halloween movie and tribute to Curtis who died March '' this year+dvd
Role Model?  Far From It+N+Jessica Simpson is a talentless bimbo.  She is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model - a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing Brittany and Christina for showing too much skin.  We all know now that the hypocritical Jessica Simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right.  She is NOT a role model and her songs/tv specials are lower than below average+dvd
Dance On+P+First, let me start off by saying I think the casting choices for this movie were perfect.  I had doubts that the movie would be any good, because I'm not exactly a fan of Jennifer Lopez's acting, but she did a brilliant job playing her part.  The movie had great sensual dance seens, and a substantial, interesting storyline to go with it.  I'm addicted to dance movies, and anyone who says a dance movie with older people in it can't be good is definitely wrong.  Richard Gere was amazing.  This movie rocked+dvd
Jessica is AWESOME!!+P+This is a wonderful DVD of Jess.  It shows an *inside view* of Jess' life on tour plus includes several interviews with her as well as songs.  I learned alot of info from this CD about Jessica that I did not know previously.....and I thought I knew *it all*??!!  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who is a SERIOUS Jessica Simpson fan and wants to learn more about her.  It also gives you an inside *peek* into the Hollywood *biz* and the fast-pace lifestyle Jess lives!!+dvd
Did I miss something here?+N+I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide".  I saw the 1974 production twice.   My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once.     This DVD should have been an excellent performance.  Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible.   Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image.  I assumed it was a really bad recording job.   Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy?+dvd
Game 6: The $500,000 movie - Four strikes, you are out. OUT!+N+Upon the brief trailers and DVD cover that gave me the visuals of this show, I thought I would really enjoy it. It was set 20 years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion (later in the series) the Mets (Led by such greats as Lenny Dykstra and Daryl Strawberry) beating the Red Sox (Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, to name a few) in that world series. The error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports.  That, however, is in the foreground, much like the Yankee's world series was (led by Reggie Jackson's heroic and never ending home run hits) in the movie "Son of Sam" serial killing spree of Sam Berkowitz in NYC in the 1970's.  At first glance, I thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion, all the way down to the end when Bill Buckner misses the easy grounder to first base. What we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives, tie it all together, and have some meaning come out of it. The result is what I should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays: Dull, Boring, spinning wheels that get stuck, continue to spin, and lead nowhere. There is nothing poignant, profound, or purposeful with the script of this movie, and if there is, I guess I was to wrapped up in watching the Red Sox let another one slip away.  First off, we have a decent cast to say the least: Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., and Catherine O'hara (Home Alone fame) are all actors who have shined in the past and though aren't so much of household names anymore, can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits.  The problem is not them. The problem is the script! Michael Keaton is a man about to go through a divorce. His daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman (remember, this is 1986, not 2006) and he's seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes. It doesn't seem to bother him much though, as the character Keaton plays (Nicky Rogan) is a famous playwright in the Big Apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else. The camera is always showing the cabbies ID cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the Middle East. STRIKE ONE: This little display doesn't seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film, and seems not only unnecessary, but also ultimately ANNOYING after about the fourth cab ride. Rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he's not sure how it's going to be perceived by the masses. STRIKE TWO: Despite all the things outside Rogan saying he's supposed to be worried, scared, or bothered, he doesn't really come across that way. If anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion, feeling, or personality.  He is supposed to be nervous because critic David Schwimmer (Downey Jr.) is going to be the major reviewer of his new play. Schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of Syd Barret (see: Pink Floyd founder/drugs/gone crazy supposedly/left band/becomes artistic recluse) in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he's had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery. STRIKE THREE: This entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground, including a standoff with Rogan in Schwimmer's apartment with Rogan's teen daughter half naked on the couch, it just doesn't fly. By this time in the movie I'm saying I don't really care.  I'm going to give them one more chance at bat...STRIKE FOUR!: At one point in the movie, Rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety. Okay I'm thinking there will be some Bernard Goetz (see: Bernard Goetz/weird engineer/NY resident/4 would be robbers on subway/Goetz shoots them/becomes cult icon/hero/crazy dude for self defense and gun ownership) type situation brewing. The gun is fired off in Schwimmer's apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt (thankfully, I mean I didn't REALLY want anyone to get hurt). After that (I'll call a BALL ONE! here) Schwimmer and Rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize: They both are Boston natives, and HUGE Red Sox fans.  Rogan's mistress, who happens to be funding his new play, and Rogan's father, who is in ailing health and Rogan visits now and again, make Guest appearances. There are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned Red Sox bond come into play, but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning. Sure, the fat lady isn't singing yet, but like they said in the special features part of the DVD; The world series wasn't technically over for the Sox in that game, as the loss forced it to game seven in which the Mets ultimately won, but it didn't matter. Every fan knew it was a done deal, despite the hope.  In the end Rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her (nope, this time its actually someone not from the middle east) to go to a bar and watch the game. The actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan, though I still feel bad for Buckner, and all the BOSOX fans, when that ball went through his glove and the Mets scored the winning run as a result.  Special Features: In trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film, I learned that there were basically two ideas (1986 world series & Playwright vs. Critic showdown) that were eventually melded into one. Although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film, its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs. critic storyline is way to loose. It never really comes across strong and again, with the exception of the BOSOX tie between the two men, the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that don't hold up well at all. I understand its an "unconventional film" but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film.  In the end, this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when Buckner missed that ball. It's to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better.  Oh yeah, I gave it an extra "strike", and its still here. Sorry, you are outta here! Game OVER! See you on the "Field of Dreams" someday in rerun land.+dvd
Naughty but clever+N+Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.  Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine+dvd
Criterion misses the boat on this one+N+I'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because Debbie Harry is in it. It is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers' discretion. Is Debbie Harry real or is she just another "Videodrome" hallucination? I definately wouldn't say this is a "fun" movie either...after watching it I felt dirty and sleazy, like I needed to take a long hot shower. Anyway, since this is the big fancy "Criterion Collection" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version+dvd
Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Three +P+DVD good quality however some of the cartoons I do not care for specificall+dvd
Love  love love this movie+P+I have always been a big fan of Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton, I bought the picture when it first came out on vhs. I think I viewed it to many times because the picture and sound quality began to fade, thus I looked all over the country side for the dvd version to no avail, so I decided to order it from Amazon.com only to find it on the shelf at Target a few weeks later but I don't regret my purchase, thanks guys. I'm sure I will enjoy it for many years to come. It's such a funny and dramatic picture+dvd
Nearly as good as the grammy winning CD+P+Wow - can these guys play. Lukather the "childish", noisy one, Carlton the "mentor" with lots of elegance. But please: Remember to buy the duo's Grammy Award winning CD "No substitutions" produced buy Steve Vai and Lukather. The CD is even better than the DVD. The song lists are about identical - and Carlton's solo after EXACTLY 8 min.s on the CD is just... FANTASTIC!!!+dvd
Firefly+P+Joss Whedon does it again! This series combined sci-fi with an old west slant. The characters and storyline developed quickly, but left you wanting more. I'm sorry there was only one season+dvd
"I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!"+P+This movie is freakin' WEIRD! Thankfully, I like weird. For the uninitiated, this is a musical about a man-eating plant (voiced by Levi Stubbs of The Four Tops). It must be seen to be believed. Our hero, Seymour, discovers a never-before-seen plant, naming it Audrey II (after his coworker and love interest, Audrey). Turns out, the plant eats humans, as he learns when it drinks his blood. At first, Seymour befriends the plant, who helps him get around Audrey's boy friend, a sadistic dentist (the song about him and pseudo-S&M scene that result are freakin' hilarious!) Eventually, things get out of hand - the plant's uniqueness earns Seymour much fame, even though nobody is aware of the plant's dangers. When the plant eats Seymour's boss, things get out-of-hand, and the final battle between the two is hilarious also - Levi Stubbs offers his amazing pipes, declaring "I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!" - one of my favorite movie quotes. This movie is a real side-splitter, and must be seen+dvd
Returned it to the store!!+N+This video/DVD lacks the content it claims it has.  It only covers 5 or so letters, and does not focus on the sounds.  It is pain-stakingly boring, lacks excitement and did not keep my 20 month old daughter's attention.  Even the bonus section that is supposed to teach the letters on the DVD version did not appeal to her.  Needless to say, we returned this one to the store.    I recommend Leapster's Letter Factory which has taught my daughter the sounds of the letters within 2 weeks and has a bonus interactive letter game+dvd
DINOSAUR LONGEVITY AND SCIENTIFIC FACT+P+The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
the best movie version+P+I am happy to report that this is not only better than the other movie versions of The Prince and the Pauper, but that it is a very good movie.    The 1937 version (a.k.a. "the Errol Flynn version") is quite good, but the ending was boggled by the introduction of an unnecessary and unhelpful delaying action, which was then made worse by being repeated (!), dispelling the high tension of the climactic end.  The twins who played the lead were very appealing but were made to speak in a very phony (sickeningly sweet) way.  There are also technical limitations, such as the sound quality.  I'd give it 4 stars.    The 1978 version with an all-star cast had much going for it.  The big stars all played their roles well, but the movie was ruined by using a 20 year-old boy to play the 12 year-old Prince.  And he was repellant as well.  Also, the "rollicking" scenes went on a bit too long and too often.  I'd give it 3 stars.    Fortunately (and for a change), the screenwriters learned from these past versions and this version is flawless.  The story rolled smoothly, not too fast, not slow, without repetitions or unnecessary delays or needless complications.  The twins who played the lead were appealing and played their parts well.  All of the cast were good.  The color, the photography, the music, the sound--all good.  The ending was just right.  This version also added a coda in which the Prince of Wales kept his various promises made to the several poor people who had been kind to him.    Bottom line: Don't miss it.  Also, the whole family can enjoy this one.  +dvd
Being There+P+Just a wonderful vehicle for Peter Sellers.  It not only illustrates his comedic abilities, but also the strength of his straight acting.  There is a wonderful cameo from Shirley Maclaine, and the supporting cast are exactly that. This is a heart-warming, yet on deeper consideration quite sad film - 'What if......?', and I rate it highly+dvd
A Sad Mess Filled With Missed Opportunities & Lots Of Potential+N+I give this hack job the extra star for the fact that it had some very creepy visuals a handful of jumpy scares & a good idea for a story. How sad is it though when that kind of potential can't crutch the horrible outcome,wich resides in plot-hole central USA,home of the university of bad acting & laughable endings(UBALE). Oh man! Horror fans! "BOO" could have been an excellent new low-budget horror flick if it had a tighter script with a much better ending & included some half decent actors who actually had a grip on there character's. All & all what we are left with is an all over the place mess with some good visuals & scares. So many missed opportunities & so much potential lost. What a sad waste!  +dvd
Great Workout+P+This is a very fast paced workout.  It took a couple of times through to learn the routine.  Denise doesn't cue all that well.  She's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement.  Most people don't like that about her, but I think she is motivating.    You definitely work all muscle groups and you'll be sweating with this workout.  I'm tired, but invigorated by the end.  I enjoyed this workout a lot+dvd
Uh, like where are the videos +N+I dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv.  The videos were the best part!  I asume its because mtv didn't want to pay royalties to the bands, so they called it the "Mike Judge Collection" and left them out.  Uh, That Sucks+dvd
10.5 on the unrealistic scale+N+One of the supporting actresses said it best in this movie, "Forget what you saw on TV."  The entire disaster is based on, well, make-believe.    And to top it off, it appears the only person in the entire country who figured out what is going on has written scientific books that nobody else believes.  Everybody else are idiots and have absolutely no idea what to do.  In fact, the head of FEMA, who has been placed in charge of overseeing the problems, can't seem to come up with more than one plan.  He draws a complete blank when asked for a contingency plan.  And then there is the entire nuclear warhead thing is just laughable and a complete ripoff of Armagedon.  The only thing missing was Bruce Willis.  The only thing that was promised and delivered was the special effects.  It actually wasn't all that bad for a made-for-TV movie.  Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can come up wtih.  The acting was silly, the dialogue was horrocious, the length was way too long, and the reality wasn't existent.  All in all, I would not recommend this unless you are really into disaster flicks (which my wife is and why I ended up watching it myself). +dvd
Grab the Tissue+P+This is a love story personified.  And I am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day.  This is what LOVE really is.  . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part.  And I do not believe it ends there.  So if you want to know what LOVE really is - watch this movie or read the book.  It is fantastic+dvd
Bridges of Madison County DVD+N+The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault).  I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed.  It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing.  The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open.  But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house.  That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case.  Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you.  The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little+dvd
If you want the real deal go region 2+N+I'm amazed that the US still has to put up with this half baked rush release, If you want the fully realised package with English sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version ISBN B000BY9ALU. OK so it'll probably cost you twice as much and you'll need a multi region player. But for something this good why put up with second best. This is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on, as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused. It continues the theme from GITS 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking. At times it gets a touch pretentious with Batou and Togusa swapping obscure quotations, but it is both beautiful and thought provoking.  Again a split review 5 for the film, 2 for the slipshod DVD release+dvd
Enthusiastic If Not Gay+P+The professional reviewer missed the main point of Jeffrey's dilemma. He's not so afraid of getting AIDS; he's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it. Most people figure a 50% chance of dying before their spouse; but taking on a person with a known, fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate, poignant situation.  Steve Weber is no gayer than George Bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser. This was the first film I saw Michael Weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay. I knew Patrick Stewart isn't, but his performance is dead on.  Overall, a very funny movie with a big, big heart+dvd
My kids loved this+P+I showed excerpts from this series to my ninth-grade science classes and got lots of positive feedback.  My own kids liked it as well.  Lots of good "probable case scenarios."  Will drive creationists crazy. +dvd
"Sometimes truth defies reason."+P+The Meiks brothers had a troubled childhood. Very troubled. Their mother had died after Adam was born, leaving his older brother Fenton to take care of him with the help of their father. The three males seemed to fend well for themselves, not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life. It was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come. But all of that changed one night when Dad (curiously, his name was never revealed in the film, being credited as "Dad Meiks") rushed into the boys' room, flipped on the light, woke them up, and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way. Dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by God himself. The heavenly apparition told him of his new calling: to be a destroyer of demons. According to the angel, the biblical end times had come and there were demons of Hell now walking among mortal man, disguised as humans. Dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon, and thereafter he would receive a list. The list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities, but, just like the demons themselves, were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul. It was now up to this family of three to become warriors of God. The young Adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it. But Fenton was disturbed by these ideas, insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real. Yet surely enough, step by step, it all began becoming a reality. The main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed, with gloves by its side. They came to find out, that the gloves were for Dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house. Because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands, he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were. They weren't humans of course, they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of God that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons. At first Fenton wanted to run away and get help. But as time moved on, trapped within this world of madness and extremism, he began to question his reality as a whole. Could he brake away from this terrible mess he'd been drawn into, or was he destined to become a demon-slayer, just as his father was, and just as his brother would come to be? Years later, as a full-grown adult, he gets a frantic phone call from his brother. Shortly after, he decides to give FBI agent Wesley Doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life. At first Doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the "God's Hand" serial killer case. Yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses, they take a trip to the burial site of the victims, where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus. It turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined.  2001's Frailty is a dark web beautifully spun by it's makers and deserves a look from any and every fan of suspense and horror films. It's a clever, disturbing, thought-provoking piece with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you impressed - if not a bit creeped out! Starring Bill Paxton, Mathew McConaughey, and Powers Booth (among others) you can be assured that the acting really brings out the depth and haunting minds of the characters. And with a great script and crew work, it's no wonder why this is one of the best films in years for fans of the genre. Not to mention several nice extras on the DVD (including deleted scenes, documentaries/featurettes, and commentary by director/actor Bill Paxton). For sure, Frailty is a winner all the way+dvd
Awesome cult horror comedy!+P+In the streets of New York City where the homeless live in a junkyard and on the streets, two bum brothers named Fred (Mike Lackey) and Kevin ( Mark Sferrazza) are living together in a hut of a auto-wreck place thinking that their lives have become crap for them. A liquor store owner however discovers in his store a old box of special liquor called "Vipor" that is 40 years old and sells them for a buck, unfortunately it has a bad side effect on those who drink it would literally melt or explode.  An original, tasteless, and entertaining horror comedy has gained a cult following since it was released in 1987, sure the acting can be bad but the movie has awesome gore, melting and body explosion make-up effects with a dark sense of humor to help the flick. There's also some nudity for those who love nudity, nicely photographed and also star R.L. Ryan ( the actor who played the fat mayor on "The Toxic Avenger") as a boss.  The DVD has sharp picture and nice sound quality as the only extra is the theatrical trailer, this is a must have DVD for fans of horror comedies, gore flicks, Troma movies and Peter Jackson's early works.  Also recommended: "The Toxic Avenger", "C.H.U.D.", "Dead Alive ( a.k.a. Braindead)", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "The Incredible Melting Man", "Day of the Dead", "Re-Animator", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky", "Tetsuo The Iron Man", "The Stuff", "An American Werewolf in London", "Cabin Fever", "Videodrome", "Caligula", "The New York Ripper", "Maniac (1980)", "Land of the Dead", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2", "Shogun Assassin", "Rabid Grannies", "Ichi The Killer", "Tromeo and Juliet", "Terror Firmer", "Ninja Scroll", "Robocop", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "High Tension", "Friday The 13th series", " Freddy Vs.

The novel would be better+N+Harold Ramis's "The Ice Harvest" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires.  All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice.  In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - "Nobody's Fool," for example.  But a dark comedy needs some pep, and "The Ice Harvest" doesn't have it.  A lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.  He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in "High Fidelity" and "Say Anything."  Here, Cusack's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he's made as a leading man, and that's a shame.  Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt.  The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he's enjoyable on-screen, but when he's not there, we miss him.  The bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of "The Ref," for example.  The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits.  Instead, we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke "Fargo" or "A Simple Plan," but doesn't get anywhere close.    There are a few laugh-out-loud moments that I won't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time.  But all in all, the movie is a downer, and when the winners are finally revealed at the end, it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion.    Throughout the movie, I kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves.  Petty crime can be highly enjoyable, but not in "The Ice Harvest." +dvd
Total Electric Borefest+N+I owned the original VHS version...I quickly gave it to a friend of mine, free of charge.  Eric Johnson may be considered a guitar great (I don't get it), but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video. Some people just aren't good teachers, no matter how great a guitarist they are.   As an added bonus, his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video, even during specific examples & demos! Say what?  Finally, the length of the video was way too long (or at least it felt that way. It took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish).  Throw in a mind-numbing finale/lecture about patch cables, cable length, pick gauge, strings, theories on physics and you get Eric Johnson: Total Electric Guitar - Agonizing to watch & absolutely God-awful.   Stick w/ Brian Setzer (THE rockabilly instructional bible), James Burton (Hello.....Elvis' guitarist!), Yngwie J.(THE only instructional video you need for precision shredding), Danny Gatton (1 & 2: encyclopidias of all styles) or B.B. King: Bluesmaster (extremely in-depth analysis/demos of B.B.'s style by B.B.) Instructional videos/DVDs. Even if it's not your style, these are highly informative, educational & entertaining. I highly recommend these+dvd
One of my favorite movies+P+Incredibly well directed, put us into a wonderful world of dreamlike desires, anguishes and hopes. Fellini's movies always talk the language of the unconscious mind+dvd
Not a "Killer back" workout+N+I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas.  The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play.  But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back.  In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form.  A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn.  A good abs and waist workout as well.  There are alot of twisting moves.  The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one.  Michael only performs half of the exercises himself.  He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention.  I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.     He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout.  But its easy to manage without them. +dvd
Good job on a Great Story but the Goliath encounter was awful+P+Excellent story and they followed most of it fairly accurately.  Good job with the repercussions of David's adultery and how it affected his entire household for a long time thereafter.  The dynamics of the sons were well-done with only minor omissions in the plot here and there but not enough to damage the story badly... except in the case of Goliath.  With all the information about the account you'd think they could get one detail right but I'm not sure any aspect of it was accurate.  First of all, they show Goliath no larger than anyone else.  Also, there is no real context of a war and battle here... Goliath is just ambushing Saul's soldier's a couple at a time.  There is no forty days of taunts, David is already here, and Saul is about to bravely charge off to face Goliath (never showing the least fear of Goliath) when David says to let him.  He doesn't even try on Saul's armor (though Saul mentions it while ridiculing David about the impossibility of David fighting).    The only other major issue I recall was the presence of some excessive spirituality.  For example, when Saul is overcome by the Spirit he never prophecies, he just dances rather provocatively (a similar presentation when David dances but it is at least slightly more accurate in David's case).  I'm not counting the Witch of Endor scene in that, since it is supposed to be spiritualistic- as per general suppositions, her spiritualistic nature is extremely freaky and witch-like with her screaming and chanting and so forth [but try to remember all witchcraft is not so blatant]).  Remember these are wars and adultery, etc. and they are true to the Biblical account in that sense so they are not meant for family viewing+dvd
A disappointment in a way...+N+For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon+dvd
No way out+P+A perfect movie. A truthfull face of the world of sales and what happens when your back is against the wall. Jack Lemmon's best performance+dvd
Kill Me Now.+N+Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film.  It's so aggravating.  I want to chew my own leg off half way into it.  I know part of it is everyone is a "talker" of a various sort.  They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell.  I just don't think it works.  Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived.  The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves.  It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.  Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen.+dvd
THE MIRACLE OF ... WHAT?+N+This is my first time in this forum  I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE  AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist.   I choose the first option.   Are you so kind  -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ?  Yours  R+dvd
Terence Hill, Bud Spencer, Lionel Stander in the west.+N+Also known as Trinity Rides Again/ La Collina degli stivali.   The print of this 1969 Italian western film is very poor.  Grainy and greenish sometimes.  Right away you will notice that Terence Hill and Lionel Stander (A Star Is Born [1937], Hart To Hart tv series [1979-84], Hart To Hart tv-movies [1993-96] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else.  Sometimes you hear Stander's real voice.  Stander plays a circus ringmaster.  With his assistance he will help Terence and Bud Spencer take down the bad guys in the west. Difficult film to enjoy without Terence Hill's real voice.  Victor Buono also in the film+dvd
Unfinished+N+The film looks unfinished. The animations are uncompleted and the film struggles to hold a story running.  However; it has some interesting sci-fi features which makes the film worth watching... If you are a sci-fi fan with waaay to much spare time; that is+dvd
emminently skippable+N+Add me to the folks who thought this would continue the storyline and were disappointed. There's really no reason to get this one unless you just want to own them all. All of the footage is cut from older episodes with a few extra bits of dialogue added.   Wish I'd checked for reviews before picking it up.+dvd
South Park:  The Down Years+N+Definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten. Adults beware.  These guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes. I hope Trey and Parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons. Besides the smugness, I am tired of all the voices in South Park sounding all too similar.+dvd
poor quality piece, but...+N+i was extremely disappointed with this dvd, in both content and quality.    i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances.  fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences, be it for a television broadcast or live concert.  the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired.  but... the "bonus" documentary was redeeming.  "half mile a day" is definitely the stronger half of this dvd; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the "bonus" selection.  i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary+dvd
The book is fascinating; the movie fails it.+N+I'm a retired attorney. I enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually. However, this movie simply is a pain to watch, IF one enjoyed the drama of the book. The book "Blood Work" is very detailed and the solution to the "who done it" is very well hidden. I won't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel, read the review by "km southern" dated Oct 19, 2004, that is available below. She is right on. The movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based, it is a poor choice+dvd
Awful, incoherent mess.+N+This movie's only redeeming quality is the visual effects... as an artist, I have to admire their efforts. But other than that, the movie is just unwatchably bad.  There just isn't a coherent plot. The movie jumps from place to place, throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen. Every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering, another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion.  Add in bad acting, awful "humor", and you'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through+dvd
Interesting in that...creepy kind of way. +P+John Hawkes is Richard Swersey, a recently separated shoe salesman and father of two boys, in this story of just a few of life's most basic, yet complicated relationships. Richard struggles with the separation from his wife until he meets Christine, an eccentric artist who doesn't starve only because she chauffeurs the elderly. Richard's sons find love, one conversationally on the internet, and the other physically from the neighborhood girls who want to experiment with him. The movie was written and directed by Miranda July who also starred in the film as Christine.   I thought it was good, but not great. I loved the incorporation of the name of the movie into the theme of the story. I thought that was great. I enjoyed the well-written dialogue. It was certainly an interesting film, just not the most entertaining. Some parts of the movie seemed to move too slowly, though I can appreciate that, to an extent, it was done on purpose (see also: artistically). The movie received some pretty harsh reviews from family and friends, but I am happy I still took the time to see it. I had hoped to catch it in the theater, but was glad to finally see it once and for all on DVD.+dvd
Great Chess Story+P+Probably the only available good chess movie. (There are a bunch on other sports but not on chess) Worth watching if you like chess, atleast once+dvd
Witness the greatest moments in A's history !+P+This DVD is great for any A's fan or just baseball fans in general. This DVD has 4 seperate films you can choose from on the main screen that document that year's world series. These were also made in the year that the series was played. I enjoyed seeing the footage of A's greats like Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue, Terry Steinbach, Mark McGwire, Dave Stewart, and Blinkie McBlinkerson.....errr I mean Jose Canseco+dvd
Cheap Switcheroo...+N+Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the "new" slimline Thinpak.  Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least.  They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style.  SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)??  This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to "head shots" of Simpsons characters.  After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases.  Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price.  Gotta love that marketing plan!  I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school+dvd
I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.+N+I like Marlee Matlin and some of the other DVDs in the Baby Einstein series so was looking forward to this one.  It is unfortunately not that great for teaching sign language (I prefer both "My Baby Can Talk" and "Signing Time").  The worst part of it is how long a child has to wait for the actual content; there is no way to skip the COMMERCIAL for "Disney's Little Einsteins"+dvd
Disney needs to get it together!+N+For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.  Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement+dvd
Just Another Heist Movie+N+&quot;Heist&quot; is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a &quot;who fools who?&quot; picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid+dvd
Sadly Overlooked Action Adventure Comedy+P+Christian Slater's character reminds me of a young Jack Nicholson, who replaces his brother on the Police Force after he is murdered. I was surprised that he didn't become as popular as Tom Cruise after this film was released in 1992, but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career.  I think he's a better actor than most people realize, with much more talent than making below average movies like "Broken Arrow". +dvd
Euuuwww......Creepy!+N+This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!+dvd
Moving and inspiring, not matter what the final verdict was...+P+I've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film.  I don't think anyone can deny the power in Denzel's brilliant performance, but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned, it's been judged harshly for it.  I personally don't know the truth behind this mans conviction, his innocence and his quilt, only he knows, but the portrait painted by this film portrays Rubin `The Hurricane' Carter as a victim of a corrupt system.  To me it's a very moving film, regardless if it's true or not, and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom.  Denzel delivers his finest performance here; a well deserved Oscar nomination, and proves that he is a very talented actor.  I am a fan of Denzel, although I've made my concern very clear (the fact that Denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters), and I feel he shines here.  Despite the constant criticism, I feel this is a must-see film, if not for the emotional, albeit somewhat fictionalized (or assumed is a better word since no one really knows), story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved.  Dan Hedeya does a great job as the crooked (fictional) detective who makes it his life goal to punish Rubin for a crime he committed as a child (a crime that should never have been considered a crime) and Vicellous Reon Shannon does wonderfully as Lesra, the young man who not only fights for Rubin's freedom but helps Rubin to regain the hope and life he once had.  Like I said, very heartwarming and touching, and regardless of whether or not Rubin was guilty or innocent, the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from Lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see+dvd
"Is This A Kissing Story?"+P+I'm a big fan of fantasy films from the 1980s, and after reviewing a couple here on amazon, this particular DVD came up. "Looks a bit girly," I thought, and so did my brother when he came over and spotted it on the coffee table. But for the most part "The Princess Bride", is actually fun for both boys and girls, and for viewers of all ages.  A boy (Fred Savage from "The Wonder Years") is sick in bed, so his Granpa (Peter Falk) comes to visit him. He's brought a book for them to read together called "The Princess Bride", a book that's been in the family for generations, and has always cheered the family up when they're sick. The boy is put off by the name, but decides to humour his grandpa and lets him read. His grandpa tells a tale of a peasant girl, Buttercup, (Robin Wright) who falls deeply in love with a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes), only to be heartbroken when he goes on a trip, apparently killed by pirates on the way. Buttercup vows never to love again, but these words don't stop the prince of Florin from taking her hand in marriage. Before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a Sicilian, then counter-kidnapped by a fear some "dread-pirate". But things are not as they appear, love that was thought to be dead is actually alive, and many an adventure and story are had, in this land full of monstrous eels, giant rats, fire-swamps, giants, six-fingered swordsmen and horrible instruments of torture.  Though there is a little bit of romance and melodrama in the film, it is a fairly light hearted piece. Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun. The score, which is mostly GM-like keyboard tones, by Mark Knopfler adds to the goofiness of things, though it is a tender track when it needs to be. The sets and costumes are pretty nice too, as is the character development. There's a couple of cameo appearances in the film as well, (like Billy Crystal as a "Miracle Worker") so keep an eye out.  Worth a look for fans of fantasy and of romantic comedy. Don't be put off by the title, it's a lot more than (as Fred Savage's character puts it) a "kissing story"+dvd
just ok+N+the show lost it's zip by season 7. the chemistry wasn't the same. the scripts had gotten watered down&you could sense a show just going through the motions on quite a few of these episodes.the show had it's last real peak during Season 4.i still enjoy watching the show though+dvd
Most boring idiotic pointless anime I've ever watched+N+Nothing happens.  Nothing!  You watch for...what 5 to 6 hours to discover the rediculus "blue" is just here to wipe out the earthlings because of overpopulation.  Big Deal!  Anyone who gives this thing a more than two don't know what story telling is all about.  Soon as I can I'm getting rid of this crap.  You don't want to be bored silly by a pointless story that goes nowhere don't get this thing. +dvd
What HD is All About!+P+I purchased an HD-DVD player with this title in mind and it doesnt disappoint. This is by far one of the very best HD-DVD's on the market to date and even tho the brand is somewhat new, that is still saying something as there are a bunch of beautiful releases already. This is without a doubt a reference quality disc both in terms of the picture, Audio and in terms of extras and what the HD format can do that regular DVD's cant.  First the picture and what a picture it is. It is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail. The amount of grain is perfect with no noticable noise & no edge enhancment was visable throught the entire film. The skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate. One of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black. Black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows. The scene where he is spraypainting his batsuit with the black spraypaint has to be seen to be believed. I dont think I have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful. There isnt a single thing I would change with the picture. My hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer, its one of the best I have ever seen.  As for the audio, the Dolby Digital Plus track is amazing but the TrueHD track is where this baby really takes off. if you own the Toshiba A1 you need to update to the 2.0 firmware udate to be able to use the TreHD and its everybit worth updating. The Batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general, very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should. On the TrueHD track it sounded simply stunning. Dialogue was easily heard without sacrificing any of the other sounds and effects. Overall its the best TrueHD track so far and that again is saying something as Training Day had an awsome TrueHD track, it just couldnt beat out the power this soundtrack had.  As for the extras, were presented with all of the extras from the 2 disc special edition plus the HD-DVD exclusive IME track (In-Movie Experience). There were some people who complained that this IME track wasnt as good as some of the others because some of the pauses between speakers were fairly long. I have to 100% disagree with this. When people on the IME track are speaking non stop and the IME track runs non stop you are never really given a chance to get into the movie as all of your attention is focused on the IME screen. With Batman Begins they made it so the IME track was active during the less important and less exciting scenes and inactive during the exciting and important scenes. What this did was allow you to actually get involved with the movie while at the same time get information from the IME track during the more boring and less important parts of the movie. They absolutly did this on purpose and you can tell alot of thought went into when the IME should be active and when it shouldnt. In the end it was unlike anything I have ever experinced before with a commentary track and when the movie was over I had felt like I had not only just seen the IME track but I had also watched the movie. It was awsome and really has me sold on IME. I thought that IME might be kind of gimmicky when Ifirst got into HD-DVD but it couldnt be farther from the truth. IME is the future of commentary tracks and there really is no comparison between IME and the old style of commentary.   So to sum this up, Batmen Begins is a must buy if you own a HD-DVD player. Its one of the best super hero movies ever made and this HD-DVD transfer is the best it has ever looked. Put a big dose of amazing sound and a big dose of IME on top of that and you have what is arguably the best release so far for HD-DVD.   Its releases like this that make me happy I got into HD-DVD right off the bat without worrying about the damned format war. as long as HD-DVD keeps performing at this level, I will be an HD-DVD supporter till the end.

Painful.+N+Half Light (Craig Rosenberg, 2006)  I've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards, and it's brought a somewhat related (if tangentially) point into focus for me: why it is that movies like Darkness, the 2002 Spanish "thriller" with all the suspense of a Pee Wee Herman monologue, and Haute Tension, France's painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror, come over to America and fall flat. Well, I knew the answer, but really, you're all providing me with more evidence. You've never seen a good horror film in your life, have you? Because that's really the only way I can see justifying Darkness, Haute Tension, or Half Light as marginal, much less good, movies.  Demi Moore plays Rachel Carlson, an American author living in Scotland with her husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and their son Thomas (the wonderfully-named Beans el-Balawi, recently in the TV adaptation of Beneath the Skin). Thomas suffers a household accident, which leads to Rachel and Brian splitting up. Rachel's friend Sharon (Coupling's Kate Isitt) finds Sharon a lovely, secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write (and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded, where they're bound to be tormented by guilt?). Rachel meets a number of fine locals, including Angus McCulloch (The Mists of Avalon's Hans Matheson), keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place, with whom she feels an instant attraction. Despite being free of the marriage bond, Rachel's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger...  ...and neither are we. There's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters, but it's never realized. It's probably off looking for the film's suspense, which Rosenberg reminds us we're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clichï¿½ in the entire book. Once you've figured out the movie's big twists (yes, there's more than one, handled with all the delicacy afforded to, say, a road being repaved), which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film, Rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end. There's only one problem-- the movie's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied. (Go look at the film boards in various places. There is one question that crops up over and over again. It relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across.)  It's not often that I say Darkness is better than another horror film. After all, Darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible. But if you have died and gone to Hell, and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity, Darkness should be a no-brainer. Yes, this one's that bad. +dvd
Time goes by so slowly ... or so fast ... or backwards... or forwards+P+The third installment of our favorite wizard has him meeting a new defense of the dark arts teacher ... along with some rather scary gatekeepers as the magical world hunts for Sirius Black ... Harry's godfather who has escaped from the dreaded Azkaban prison. Meanwhile Hermione discovers a way to time travel with a special locket and take more classes. It is definitley getting darker and darker ... but this third in a series sets the tone for Harry's destiny+dvd
This loosely disguised "show" is nothing but a mouthpiece for the liberal agenda of broken marriages, pedophilia, & infidelity!!+N+This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline.  At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.  This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.  By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.  Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.  To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.  In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony.+dvd
Heavenly!!!+P+I've watched this 5 times in the past month by sharing it with everybody. Even my country/western fan son loved it+dvd
WOW, I think it's worth buying!!!+P+I bought this season coupple of days ago, and WOW, is all I haver to say. It seems like the shows are longer, better acting (well some scence), and I like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast.   If you are a Knight Rider fan like mylself, then this should be in your collection!!+dvd
The fFrst World War,Harbinger of a tumultuous century+P+With present day footage masterfully juxtiposed with much,heretofore unseen,period film, this multi-disc history of the Great War breathes life into the first quarter of the twentieth century unlike an i've seen thus far. We are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our twenty-first century lives. The mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes, in riveting detail, the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism. This series is neither dry or pedantic but illumunates facts with which everyone should be acquainted. Perhaps we can avoid a repetition of this debacle+dvd
No Closed Captions!+N+The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions!  If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it.  The box should have contained a clear message:  No Closed Captions!  (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.)    The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price.  If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion.  Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films.  I found the Greenwald film much more convincing+dvd
I wish I could have rated it 0 star+N+I decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it. I watched it with my girlfriend. Bad idea... The sex scenes are bad and very short, and the rest is downright boring. This movie is simply bad, and slow, and generally laughable+dvd
This version is much better+P+I purchased the first version eagerly when it was released. Since then I've purchased the rest of the seasons and was relieved when they started making the slim more compact packaging. I also noticed there were some flaws in the first set of DVD's like no intro music and some other glitches that didn't match the others. The first version has 9 full size DVD boxes and only 4 episodes per DVD. It's like they had to work out the kinks. It took me a long time to decide to purchase the "new" First season because I already paid $95.00 for it the first time, but I am glad I did. They added in a colorized intro section with Ricky singing "I Love Lucy" that I just love. Not to mention it's smaller and matches my collection. If your're trying to decide which First season to buy, this is the one. It has the same great first season eposides and extras, smaller, more episodes per DVD and the price is so right!+dvd
never did get it.+N+sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book,  a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper+dvd
Blech...Horrible!+N+What a disaster!  This movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish.  The animation is ugly, horrible, and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring.  What was Disney thinking?  Oh, I know!  "Let's see if we can eek a little more cash out of Cinderella.  Who cares if we destroy a beloved classic?"  Several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense.  In the first story, the King has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy, sour old curmudgeon.  Suddenly there's a rule about no commoners in the palace?  Uh...isn't there a line in the original about "every eligible maiden in the kingdom?"  The palace was FULL of commoners that night.  The story picks up as the Prince and Cinderella return from their honeymoon, so in the space of a few weeks, the King has completely changed.  I guess they weren't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters.  The other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read.  Avoid this mess of a movie.  The really sad thing is that "ugly, horrible, unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories" pretty much describes any Disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market+dvd
Mrs. Parker Would Be Proud+P+Dorothy Parker was a woman tragically ahead of her time. She wrote with real honesty and wit about what it felt like to be a woman in a man's world, and her acerbic tongue became legendary. Dorothy Parker was also a lonely woman who was profoundly unhappy all her life, failed twice at marriage and suicide, and loved her friend and colleague Robert Benchley all her life, never acting on her desire for him.  "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" does a wonderful job of depicting Dorothy Parker's life on film. It shows Parker young and vibrant in the 1920's, which are filmed in color, and then slowly fading into alcoholism in the 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. The latter sequences are shot in black and white, which is a fascinating way to structure the film. As the color drains from Dorothy's life, it drains from the screen as well. Director Alan Rudolph, who also wrote the screenplay, does a wonderful job of evoking the period of New York and Hollywood in the 20's and 30's.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is an extremely versatile actress, and she excels as Dorothy Parker. She looks, sounds, and acts so much like the real Mrs. Parker, especially in the scenes when she recites some of Parker's most autobiographical poetry. Leigh plays Dorothy as a woman who simply understood life too well, and was never able to be happy. When younger, she tried to be, but as the years roll on, you can see Dorothy slowly giving up, finally allowing herself to be forgotten. In a pivotal scene towards the end of the film, a psychiatrist tells Dorothy that she needs to face her pain more directly. Tears rollong down her face, she replies "Face it more directly? I face it every day. I fall in love with married men, but I do it purpose. I drink too much, but that's because I'm thirsty. I think my version of pain is more fun than yours." Leigh gives a brave, intense performance as Dorothy Parker, and she deserved more recognition for her work than she got.  Campbell Scott is also excellent as Robert Benchley, the fellow writer that Dorothy loved. Benchley was a married man, and the two never became intimate, although they loved each other deeply. "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" is not always an easy film to watch because it depicts a brilliant and vulnerable woman slowly drowning in her own unhappiness, with no hope that things will ever get better. In life, Parker regarded herself a failure as a writer, and died alone and forgotten at the age of 74. Her one wish was to die on a cloudy, rainy day. True to her luck, on the day of her death the sun was shining+dvd
Perfect Platinum Edition and worth collecting to all Bambi fans!+P+When I first saw the cover of this special edition, I anticipated that it would be the best ever. When I received and watched it, I found it was perfect, even better off than my anticipation! It was perfect, glorious, wonderful, splendid, fantastic... Oh, I think it can be described with many, many good words!  When I received this special edition, I was a little disappointed to the surface of the discs, because the pattern on them were not so pretty. But needless to say, the movie is, and will always be classic. However, in this special edition, the movie tableaux became more clear, but, in my opinion, the original tableaux were better, because they gave me very classic feeling. I had watched this movie when I was very, very young, and I had almost forgotten what was it about! But now, this platinum edition reminded me not only the plots of the movie but also some beautiful memories in my childhood! Just as my anticipation, many wonderful things were in disc 2! My favourite parts were Deleted Scenes and The Making of Bambi. Bambi was one of the cutest Disney characters in my opinion, and through these 2 parts, I knew how Bambi was created and something I've never known about Bambi. The part which attracted me most was The Legacy Continues, the trailer of "Bambi-2". I was excited to see this! If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't know "Bambi-2" which was so wonderful would be published! The part which entertained me much was the personality profile game called What's Your Season. Just like the fact, my season is summer, my favourite season! And the animated short named The Old Mill was so beautiful too! There were many interesting and attractive things in this 2-disc special edition, everything in it will entertain you much. It will make you to love this beloved movie more and more! And I think it will make you to wait for "Bambi-2" expectantly+dvd
Very unhappy+N+I have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by DHL Global Mail. This is a ridiculous and unacceptable situation. I will never use Amazon again, I feel cheated+dvd
If only...+P+Wouldn't it be interesting if we could see what would happen if we just made that train, missed that flight, or accepted that invitation, etc.  Some things may happen by chance but are not coincidence.  I love this movie and have always referred to it since seeing it when it first came out. After so many years, I felt it should be in my movie library. Enjoy+dvd
Disappointed by Quality and Images+N+I purchased video for my 14 month old and was really disappointed by this video. First, it claimed to tell the story of Noah's Ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about Noah.  My daughter watched the video half-way though (which is not so bad) but in general, prefers Baby Noah by Baby Einstein and Noah's Ark by Baby Miracle. While the video has a few pretty images, I do not recommend it. Hope my review is helpful. +dvd
How did Platoon miss the cut?+N+One would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many Oliver Stone movies in a row.  But, I see Stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer, unless you count his homage to Fidel Castro.  The only movies worth watching are his early movies, Salvador and Platoon, which for some reason didn't make the cut. Instead, you have the insufferable Born on the Fourth July and his conspiracy theories on the death of JFK, with a whole lot of filler in between+dvd
mind numbingly boring repetition+N+After seeing the first series, I thought (hoped) that intelligence had started to find it's way back to humor. With the second series, I see that I was wrong. Horribly wrong. In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring. If you like to "parrot" characters verbatim, play drinking games by shouting out what's coming next in a scene, or find that you've been attracted to Saturday Night Live post 1979, you might like this. I was acutely disappointed+dvd
Hilarious Example Of How Deadly-Funny Dark Satire Can Be+P+The bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school, overachievers, bored teachers, society, competitive people, politics, and marriages mired in ennui are all about. It's smart, it's incredibly funny, and it gets the most out of a very good cast.   Election, set in the 1990's at a school outside Omaha, tells the story of a frightening human dynamo, a senior who wishes to cap off her near-perfect career in high school by being elected to the student counsel presidency. As played by Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick (whose last name spelled several times in the movie all in capital letters---"FLICK"---looks suggestively like another word) sees the office as the next logical step in her sociopathic upward climb toward a full scholarship to Georgetown. Tracy has a single-mindedness that borders on mental illness, and a ruthlessness powered by a vicious drive that at times seems genuinely scary to behold. This uber-overachiever has been top of the honor roll for years, and has headed a number of extracurricular clubs, from being editor of the school yearbook to...you name it. She has also destroyed the life and reputation of a teacher who grew carelessly fond of her, and before Election is done she does-in another, here played by Matthew Broderick. Broderick's social sciences teacher, Mr. McAllister, senses the destructive force Tracy let loose on post-high school society might become, and he makes it his mission to sabotage her bid to become class president. First McAllister convinces the school's dopey star athlete, played Chris Klein, to oppose Tracy in the election, and later McAllister crosses the line and uses his position as head of the election committee to make certain Tracy loses. The meltdowns that occur to several key characters in Election are at times played off as funny but more than once the makers of this movie were courageous enough to let them be disturbing, particularly the scene where Tracy, believing the outcome of the election has not been in her favor, breaks down emotionally, revealing the insecure, needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior.   Election is comedy at its smartest. The writing is polished, the delivery of these stunningly perfect lines is flawless, and the humor mixes cerebral parody with at times a fun version of crudity. It's one of the best dark comedies of all time+dvd
bidi bidi we have trouble Buck+N+I gave this a 2 star review not because I don't like the series but the way the disks were processed. DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets+dvd
What in the world...+N+Alright, the film has gorgeous landscapes, beautiful costumes and quite talented actors.  However, if the director believed that incorporating pornography in the film would make up for its lack of historical accuracy, she was sadly mistaken.  First of all, Artemisia "was" raped by Agostino Tassi--although she did not bring up a case against him as soon as it happened--and she never fell in love with him.  Agostino Tassi, likewise, was never the loving and caring person portrayed in this film but an opportunistic man who believed himself to be superior to all other artists of his time, and the reason he raped Artemisia was that a virtuous girl would "pay" a lot of money amongst friends, and the one who rid the girl of her virginity would win and ensure that the girl didn't find a suitable husband.  Yes, Artemisia did go to trial, and yes she was tortured, but all the while for her case against Agostino Tassi.  She accused him of rape--even though her father did not support her--and won her case after being tortured and ridiculed for being a "female painter".  I was extremely disappointed in the film and I'm sure that art historians will find it as ridiculous and faulty+dvd
The Rock and  Vaughn stole the show+N+Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.   +dvd
43 years in healthcare.............+P+..........so I do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena.  I have watched them all,  Marcus Welby right on through ER.  Scrubs is the most realistic, albiet tongue-in-cheek representation of our professions.  You cannot take everything seriously,  but,  if you believe an emergency room can function like ER 24/7 and still have people standing,  you're out of touch w/ reality as well+dvd
Love Comes Softly+P+Loved the movie but I thought I was buying both of the movies in DVD and this one came in VHS.  The sequel to LCSoftly came in DVD form but I was disappointed that LCS did not+dvd
Worth one's time+P+The personality of the main character, Dr. House, is a breather from having to be PC all the time and it based on the notion of being brutally honest.  That the main character does not make allowances for diplomacy is based on the notion that he has no time for stupidity.  Therefore some people find House tiring and overly caustic, but it makes for great entertainment.  The medical info is always challenging and I enjoy googling it afterwards.  The series is one of the more intelligent ones on TV and one can actually learn from it+dvd
"I know that you cannot live on hope alone."+P+Harvey Milk was the elected supervisor of District 6 in San Francisco when he was murdered--along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978, by fellow supervisor, Dan White (who later claimed the infamous "Twinkie defense"). The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" firmly places the murder of Milk, a gay politician, into the politically significant context of the times. The crime, the verdict, and the sentence served were all shocking. This film tells the story behind the headlines.   Milk was a stockbroker on the East Coast, when he decided to pull up roots and head for San Francisco. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and quickly earned the name of "Mayor of Castro Street" for his enthusiastic community involvement. His interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office, but when the city's elections ran by district--rather than citywide--Milk became the newly elected supervisor for the Sixth District. Milk's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall.   The film includes photographs, newsreel footage, and many interviews with those who crossed Milk's path in a professional or personal capacity. Milk was passionate about public transportation, rent control, and the rights of seniors and gays. White, on the other hand, found San Francisco's Gay Day "obscene." Eerily, there are several photos of Milk that also include his killer--clean cut, ex-fireman and family man, Supervisor Dan White. The film explores the flavour of the times--San Francisco was becoming a gay Mecca, and there were some people who couldn't adjust to that fact. Senator John Briggs, who called San Francisco "the moral garbage dump of the nation" was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired. Milk fought this ballot tooth and nail, and it failed.   The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" includes two discs. One disc contains the film, and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film's premiere in Castro Street, a Dan White update, 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime, director's commentary, the Academy Awards 1985, and a photo gallery. For those of us who remember the headlines, "The Times of Harvey Milk" is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma+dvd
Fabulous Broadway Nostalgia+P+I was at the '71 Tony Awards, broadcast in March of 1971, and I thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory.  And, then, lo and behold...we get this marvelous record of theater history.  Many of the performances were from the '71 broadcast..Zero Mostel, John Raitt, Robert Preston, Carol Channing, which was the Silver Anniversary of the Tony's, full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater.  I'm so looking forward to the other DVD's of performances that were not included.  If you want to see the legends of Broadway perform their signature songs, then this is the tape for you+dvd
The Real Evil Dead+P+No other movie has ever become such a booming sense of reality to my life than the evil dead movie/s.. Bruce Campbell is one if not my favourite actor and enjoy all his movies.. This edition is great for the commentaries on it and the extra features including Bruce's little doco on fans... a must have for all fans!!!! I am scared they are thinking of remaking this fantastic movie and I just hope Mr. Rami will realize this is a mistake... 'ASH' Rules!!+dvd
Not as good as part 2 but still great+P+What can you say. This film really enthused a new generation of B-movie filmmakers. It's part of my generation and means as much to me as citizen cane meant to you know.....old people+dvd
Dated Home Movie+N+I predicted in 1994 that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan wouldn't stand the test of time. It was all the rage in 1994 and I still can't honestly tell why. With its painful --- and I mean painful --- bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy, it seems to be little more than someone's "artsy" home movie.   I agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive, self-obsessed, women-children.... That was big in the 1990s but I think it's changing. (In fairness to the film, I can also appreciate that GO FISH was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry.)  What makes this film ultimately fail, in my opinion, (aside from the acting) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young, urban lesbian ghetto. Almost all of the characters' issues, views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny, specific demographic.    There are a few crossover fans out there, but I can't imagine too many Midwestern, middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate. As a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out: "Why would I want to go see some grainy, black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives don't remotely resemble my own?"  The normal answer to that question, of course, is: because it's an interesting story with compelling characters. However, in the case of GO FISH, neither applies. There's not much of a story and frankly, you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it.   Watching this film is like seeing someone's 10 year-old home movies --- bad cinema, bad entertainment.  +dvd
The drama of war is played out by the young..+P+This is my favourite movie, and the cinematography and music are amazing.  In addition the various themes of belonging, loss, betrayal, and love, there is the fact that all these characters caught up in the war are so young.  The disfigured Caravaggio, the naive and delightful Hana, the Sikh who defuses bombs... they are all young people who are still adjusting to the fact that life doesn't always give you what you want - less so during times of war.  We even see how young the English Patient is during flashbacks, though he looks older and seems wiser since his experiences of physical and emotional loss.  He knows he's dying, but everyone around him is also aware that they too, could die at any time; that's not something that young people usually think about on a regular basis.  It is a beautiful film.  It is also a deep film that reveals how different people respond to the fact that they could die any day+dvd
Even more stupid acting and writing....+N+a second season of even more bad writing, cliches all over the place, Bell can not act, and Silver is a joke of a Tv and film producer.   Just another example of bad marketing and the TV add guys having too much say in how a show is done+dvd
EDITED!  Don't buy this edition...+N+if you wanted the whole film.  Elizabeth McGovern's (who was Oscar nominated for this) scenes were cut from this edition, in order, I imagine, for it to have a PG rating.  Buy an older VHS for the original film+dvd
Throne of Blood....+P+I was enormously fascinated by the film "The Throne of Blood" we just watched as part of our pre-AP English course in Nagoya International School, Japan. The film adopts the plot of Shakespeare's Macbeth with a Japanese setting. Macbeth is characterized as a Japanese warrior, the head of the 1st fort. After the victory, he sees a spirit (the witch-equivalent) in the forest on his way to the shogun's castle. As he has predicted, he was awarded the prestigious status of the head of the castle.  The king decided to visit his castle one day to organize a plan to kill the Banquo-equivalent character. He is extremely proud of the trust that the king has in order to arrange such an important event, but his wife believes that the king insists on killing him instead. The big gap between his optimism and his wife's pessimism leads him to the road of Tragedy.  I believe the director of the film could easily adopt the setting very similar to that of the original Macbeth, thanks to the similarities in the feudal system of Japan and Scotland. Japan also believed in the existence of spirits and how the nobleman was ranked in status was similar to that of Scotland. Kurosawa would've struggled creating The Throne of Blood if he, for example, adopted dynastic China or the Kingdom of Thailand as the scene instead of Japan.  All of the characters in "The Throne of Blood" successfully and accurately emulated the characters in the Shakespearean version. Although there were some changes in their persona (such as the Lady Macbeth character was a more modest figure than the original), all characters kept their qualities, tendencies and their role.   To people whom read Macbeth in the past, this movie is definitely worth the watch. Viewers can receive the same impression and the excitement of Macbeth with a totally different setting.  Koy+dvd
so many gaps in the story+N+This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story+dvd
big letdown.+N+Where's the screenplay to this? Dad goes over some pretty annoying eye candy of giants midgets and a huge fish without any real alligorical content and that about it folks, trashy staff. The big promise of some sort of father son relationship forming is again apparently absent.  Thumbs down of jessica lange, a great actress I ve see on stage a couple of times who goes completely wasted here (i don't think she mutters anything in excess of a couple of lines frankly) as a cartoon wife character.  Tim's aiming to be the next ed wood possibly with this one, but, and I never thought I d say this, ed wood at least had some workable screenplay.   Just plain trash+dvd
Why are there so many reviews of a product not even released yet?+N+Zero stars, for a product not yet out. (5 for a great series though)While a few of the initial reviews, or should I say PREviews listing episodes, are informative, none of these writings here really do me, or most consumers any good, SINCE THIS ITEM HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED! Amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing, drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality, the ACTUAL episodes released, packaging, possible defects (like the Magnum series & Maiden's last Live DVD, both featured defective sections...) when the product IS released, I will have to wade through 7 (as of Oct 3) B.S. PRE-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying... These PRE'S, are presented by: fans? Industry Sales schmucks? Amazon employees? Who knows, pre-buyer beware...  +dvd
Conservative, silly, embarrassing and 'dumbed-down'+N+I saw this atrocity at an I-max cinema. I wish I hadn't. The whole thing is something of a travesty of the original Fantasia. The musical selection is humdrum and conservative - compared to the original. The imagery and animation is pleasant but unexciting. The guest spots are embarrassing and twee.   If you have an interest in seeing something special done with music and images, check out Christine Schï¿½fer's "One Night. One Life" or Christian Chaudet's DVD of Stravinsky's "Le Rossignol".  Don't bother with this atrocious Neo-Con / Religious Right world vision. In the original we had Stravinsky at his wildest and dinosaurs and in this we have Noah's friggin' Ark and Elgar at his most stodgy and conservative. There is an almost tangible pusillanimousness about this Fantasia 2000 "thing" which I found most distasteful.  Let us hope that this idea stops with this one - or maybe they should hand the whole thing over to someone else to do? Maybe Miyazaki? Or some European directors?  Fantasia 2000 isn't fantastic or much of a fantasy, to tell the truth.+dvd
Rosemary's Baby...in SPAAAAAAACE!+N+Johnny Depp is my wife's favorite actor, so she bought The Astronaut's Wife from a bargain DVD bin when she saw his face on the cover.  The plot's a little garbled, but it goes something like this: Capt. Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes) and Commander Spence Armacost (Johnny Depp) go off on a space mission.  When they come back, they're different.  Some kind of weird sound--it sounds like shrieking static--was beamed into their bodies.  What it is, exactly, we're not sure.  Let's call it "a possessing entity."  This malevolent entity wants to have children.  Twins, to be precise.  So Spence becomes fixated on 1) molesting his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron), and 2) building a spacecraft for two pilots.  And then Jillian finds out she's pregnant!  And soon, Streck dies of a seizure and his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide with a toaster!  And it turns out she was pregnant...WITH TWINS!  Scary stuff, right?   Well, no.  It's not scary.  In fact, the film lingers and drags.  Struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic Sherman Reese (Joe Morton).  Sherman is convinced something is wrong.  He goes about it all the wrong way, of course, babbling on about aliens from outer space, harassing poor Jillian, and basically ensuring that he's a one note character, not an actually developed person.   This movie is a blatant rip-off (or homage, if you think it's good) of Rosemary's Baby.  This explains Theron's pageboy haircut, but doesn't excuse anything else.  The battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer's patience.  Will she escape her husband? Will Jillian abort the children? Does anyone care?  It's hard to care.  For much of the film, we're not entirely convinced that there's anything actually wrong with Spence. He seems genuinely concerned with his wife; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing, this would have made for an interesting twist (maybe she WAS crazy all along!).  But it devolves pretty quickly.  There's lots of sexual symbolism, and not the good kind.  Yes folks, this is the first film I've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with Depp's "Oh" face (fans of Office Space will know what I mean).  Is that symbolism or what?  Finally, Depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason.  It turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it (especially when angry), such that we're not sure if Spence really ever had an accent.  Wouldn't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him?  Yeah, that would have been neat movie.  Rosemary's Baby was very much a product of its time.  The Astronaut's Wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects, but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond.  EVERYONE gets that the Devil is evil incarnate and that you don't want to have his baby.  The Astronaut's Wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad...Jillian's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know.  Fortunately, Depp and Theron would go on to do much better works. Alas, the Astronaut's Wife serves as a reminder that you can't just swap out religion with aliens and assume it will be a great movie+dvd
Fairy tale Mob+N+I have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it wasn't the same movie I have. This movie in no way represents the life of La Cosa Nostra. There are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic. It's present day and the guys are &quot;running numbers&quot;. Hello, ever hear of the Lottery. They start up a &quot;bookie buisness&quot;. Besides calling it a bookie buisness, which is just plain retarded, how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster. Then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him. I guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over. Then again that might have been a good thing. The acting was terrible except for the late Ray Serra and Joe D'Onofrio. Even Joe Viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed Tons of work. Rent the HBO film Gotti if you want to see what it's really like. Just to include Wannabees and William DeMao in the same breath as Goodfellas and the great living legend Robert DeNiro is an insult. Now DeMao is making &quot;Searching for Bobby DeNiro&quot;, he could only wish. The only reason I gave it a star is because I had to, they dont let you give it none+dvd
a lot of effort, little substance.+N+There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie.  A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings.  I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film.  I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema.  A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today.  But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane.  There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon.  Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating.  This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance.+dvd
High expectations that were not met+N+I could not wait to see this movie when I first saw the coming attractions.  I can honestly say that I wasn't totally disappointed but my life isn't any better now that I have seen it.  Only a few laughs here and not many memorable scenes.  Get it if you must but I would not waste too much money for it+dvd
The Break Up is One Irritating Film+N+The Break Up is a an annoying film that presents a couple on the brink of all- out personal warfare over a relationship gone bad. This movie features plenty of yelling, deceitfulness, game playing, and other things that are common when a relationship has reached its final hours.   I can remember when this film was first released and it seemed intriguing. Based on the advertisements for the film, it looked like it would be an entertaining romantic comedy. It fact, it is neither romantic nor funny. There are dashes of humor at the beginning of the film but little else. The movie is mostly serious all the way with Vaughn and Aniston arguing almost non- stop until the very end of the film when they become civil once more.   Vaughn and Aniston were known to be personally involved with each other during the time this movie was being filmed and this fact gave me the impression that the movie would offer great chemistry and passion. But Vaughn and Aniston do not seem right in this movie. They don't seem like a likely couple and many film critics have correctly pointed out that the two were not very good together in this film.   What really bothered me most with this movie is how irritated I felt as I watched! Vaughn and Aniston continuously trade barbs with each other and Vaughn acts impatient and irritating even when he is with friends. Watching the film actually elevated my blood pressure and raised my stress level. I watched it with the hope of viewing a lightened up comedy that would serve as a good after- work stress reliever. Instead, I felt the urge to blow off steam when the movie was finally over. This drama might be the type that some bickering couples can relate to but not only could I not relate, my tolerance for this film continued to decline with each minute. I just wanted it to end to put me out of my misery.   There are a few redeeming qualities with this movie, like the individual performances by the various cast members. But the main problem with the acting is that the performers and performances don't seem to gel. The characters are fine on their own, but they don't have the on- screen chemistry so desperately needed to make this film work. It all ads up to a frustrating film that should be avoided. +dvd
Is ''cringe-worthy'' a word?+N+I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch+dvd
hmm+N+This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO+dvd
A marvelous blend of the "old" and the "new"+P+Besides painting a satisfying portrait of "upwardly mobile profesional black Americans," "Boomerang" is an appealing look at the oft-times amusing and tumultuous struggle between the sexes.  Eddie Murphy, who served as producer, is wonderful as the "player" who gets his comeupance from a female equal, in the well-proportioned form of Robin Givens.  A stellar cast that features legends Eartha Kitt and Geoffrey Holder, then up-and-comers Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and a pre-Oscar Halle Berry, established performers like Lela Rochon, Tisha Campbell, and David Allen Grier, and an over-the-top Grace Jones makes this a classic in the truest sense of the term.  Watch the film with director Reginald Hudlin's commentary.  He provides colorful insight into the pivotal use of New York locations, costuming, casting concerns, the importance of background music, film economics, and unintentional social commentary.  Many times the director's "chat" is dull; that cannot be said for the words of this talented young man.  "Boomerang," like the word implies, is a film that warrants "return" visits.+dvd
Better Than ANY Tarantino Film, Period.+P+That is coming from someone who love anything this director makes, presents, or endorses.  I think this is a very complex and satisfying film.  Using the relatively unfilmed cities of LA, such as Hawthorne, Compton, the REAL Hollywood, it utilizes a more down to earth approach to real world crime.  This isn't about a multimillion dollar heist, and the criminals are likeable and genuinely interesting even if one or two are full of themselves (Namely Ordell and Melanie.)  The film opens with the classic Across 110th Street as sung by Bobby Womack and featuring a strong Pam Grier, walking that moving sidewalk at LAX.  As the opening progresses she ends up possessing a look of worry on her face that shows a VERY strong woman's strength become vulnerablity.  From then on we meet a handful of excentric baddies and law enforcers, that are all likeable, interesting and have at least one or two funny lines (with the exception of the cop who isn't Michael Keaton, who is just a plain jackass cowboy cop)  My favorite part is the friendship/romance between Pam and the subtle and sensational Robert Forster.  Starting with a very special ride home, which bleeds to a bar, and then to Griers Apartment.  All involve rich dialogue and interest shown.  They bond thru body language, their age, and eventually music("The Del----Fonics".) The fact that Forster rushes to the nearest record store for his first Delfonics Tape is just plain cute, and shows he is falling for her music and all.  The Scenes between Grier and Sam Jackson also need recognition.  They are at times funny, terrifying, and very well acted.  There is also Robert DiNiro as an old friend/partner to Jackson, and a few girlfriends of ordell's such as Surfer Girl/PotHead Melanie, Old sex siren Simone, and Super Slow Country Girl Sheronda.  There is just a bunch of rich characters here, and they all give great parts no matter how big or how small...especially Chris Tucker, who's performance as a snitch is equal parts brilliant and hilarious.  This movie just hits a right note for anyone interested in a talky, rich picture.  Tarantino says this is a movie for older people, well at 19, I'm definitely not younger, but this is my favorite of all tarantino films, be it because of the great soundtrack, storyline, performances, direction it makes no difference.  It's my favorite period.  Give it a chance and you'll see what I see...Great Movie+dvd
Ginger Rogers Excels In Romantic Wartime Christmas Story +P+"I'll Be Seeing You", is a wonderful companion piece to that other moving wartime story produced by David O. Selznick in 1944, "Since You Went Away", and it provided Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton with one of their best vehicles during the mid 1940's. Dismissed nowadays as a sugar coated romance that piles on the sentiment I dont see that as a failing at all and instead it provides a touching human story about two injured individuals finding love at an unexpected time in their lives when things are not going well. Selznick of course will be forever remembered and revered for producing grandiose stories such as "Gone With The Wind", however his abilities with smaller scale human dramas about seemingly ordinary people in ordinary situations have I feel never been given enough recognition. "I'll Be Seeing You", which was based on Charles Martin's radio play "Double Furlough", truly proves my point that his way of approaching smaller scale story telling was just as memorable. Here Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton play two very average and identifiable people, one a victim of the world war currently engulfing the world, and the second an unfortunate victim of one action that had serious consequences, situations any individual could find themselves in. What a joy it was to discover that this beautiful little film has finally been made available via DVD after being so hard to track down for so long.  Set during World War Two "I'll Be Seeing You", has Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall a lonely woman who is half way through a prison sentence for a charge of accidental manslaughter who because of her good behaviour is given an eight day leave pass over the Christmas period. Travelling to visit her relations on the train she meets Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotton), and the two strike up a friendship. Zachary has only recently been released from the hospitial as he has been suffering from shell shock and war injuries and the plan is to see if he can speed his recovery by getting out into the world. He implusively follows Mary to her stop and pretends that he is visiting his sister in the same town of Pine Hill. Mary arranges for Zachary to visit her at the home of her aunt and uncle (Tom Tully and Spring Byington), and the pair spend much time together and very quickly fall in love. Romance develops for the two as they spend Christmas Day together and then both attend the YMCA dance on New Years Eve. Both however have the dilemma of having to tell the other of their problems and with Mary having to report back to prison at the end of the holidays time begins to run out. One their last day in Pine Hill Mary's younger cousin Barbara (Shirley Temple), unintentionally discloses to Zachary about Mary's real situation and in his initial shock and anger  he tries to get away from Mary as quickly as possible. He boards the train without really saying goodbye to her and Mary faces the lonely prospect of life back in prison with no one waiting for her. Bidding her family a sad goodbye Mary prepares to continue with her sentence but just as she arrives at the prison gates fate takes a pleasant turn for her for once when  she is greeted by a remorseful Zachary who reaffirms his deep love for her. Zachary states firmly that he truly loves her and that whatever it takes they will be together and that he will wait until she is released from prison so that they can be married.      A touching love story set at Christmas is of course a natural for romantic movie lovers however this effort is much more than just that. Fine story telling combines here with well thought out performances by the cast to create a story that leaves you with something to think about in regard to our needs as individuals. Ginger Rogers especially as the woman out on Christmas leave from prison proves once and for all what a fine dramatic actress she truly was among all her other screen talents. She also has a believable and at times quite poignant screen chemistry with Joseph Cotton as the mentally scarred Sargeant just out of hospital that makes us care about these two essentially lonely and hurt individuals. Long wanting to be recognised for more than just being Fred Astaire's dance partner, here Rogers proves that with a well thought out and modulated performance that shows beautifully all her characters insecurities and fears when she finds herself falling in love with Cotton's character. Joseph Cotton, a Selznick contractee delivers another interesting performance here and makes his Zachary Morgan a very human individual fighting a terrible affliction and then having to learn to deal with his unexpected love for Mary. Supporting performances are first rate all around. A teenage Shirley Temple fresh from her triumph in Selznick's classic "Since You Went Away", delivers another fine performance here full of teenage spunk and vivacity and I always think it a tragedy that her later teenage roles for the most part never matched the quality of her work in productions like 'Since You Went Away", and "I'll Be Seeing You". Spring Byington who had  already worked with Ginger Rogers in the delightful comedy romance "Lucky Partners", in 1940 again combines well with her here as her Aunt and despite the two having very different acting styles and screen personas they have a wonderfully relaxed rapport on screen together. "I'll Be Seeing You", had the usual meticulous attention to detail recreating in the studio exactly what was still happening in the world at that time (1944-45). Like in all war times there is always humour in among the sorrow and this production provides just that, for example in the dress shop scene,and at the YMCA New Years Eve Ball, and these are randomly situated between the more serious goings on throughout the film's running time. Of course the drama here is what makes "I'll Be Seeing You", such a standout and is vividly represented in scenes such as Mary's terrible recollection to Barbara of the incident that put her in jail, through to Zachary's ongoing efforts to curb his mental sufferings resulting from his active duties. Director William Dieterle keeps the pace of the story moving and we see a growing inner confidence developing in both Mary and Zachary that sees them overcome their fears and lack of trust in others to follow their hearts in their feelings for each other.   Tender romances about ordinary people who are not perfect are seldom seen nowadays but the strength of "I'll Be Seeing You", rests in its ability to make two such ordinary people infinitely interesting and people who we care about. I've always enjoyed the great talents of both Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton and the two make most believable lovers here. The charming Christmas setting taking place during the dark war years is guarenteed to tug at the heart strings of any romantic movie lover and it never fails to move me with its simple message of love and respect for others no matter what their affliction or failings are. Take a romantic journey back soon to a simple war time Hollywood love story to see how effectively it could be portrayed on screen in Selznick Productions, "I'll Be Seeing You" .        +dvd
gobbledygook & self-righteousness & pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie+N+there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek+dvd
Boring+N+This movie was so boring and slow moving that we turned it off after 45 minutes. Not recommended as it was too boring+dvd
How to make a bad dvd of a good concert+N+AOL music allows you to download the entire concert for free, which is FAR better than this dvd.  This is NOT a dvd of the Las Vegas concert; it is a dozen music videos, all of which were created from the concert footage.  The director has chopped-and-diced this concert beyond enjoyment.  The sound is not in true surround sound, and the MTV-style quick-cuts and wacky angles are so annoying as to make the video unwatchable. +dvd
the producers were drunk when they made this movie+N+Most off the scientific facts are wrong. The earth's center is as big as Mars!!!!!! Come on!!!!!! Maybe as big as Moon. Under the Earth's ground is liquid magma. Its liquid because off the pressure, and its not possible to under it. The Producers obviously forget about food supplies, and oxygen. The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing+dvd
Favorite Workout+P+I have to say this is my favorite of all of Leslie's workouts. Yes, I agree with the other person who said that Mary Kay is annoying, however, I feel the best when I am done with this video. I like the variety of it all+dvd
poor transfer,paging criterion+N+Since we know there is another version of "Burn" out there,i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.You can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan,poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.Brando told larry king it was his favorite film;not if he saw this package+dvd
The cell phone is the main character+N+The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it?   After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?  Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it+dvd
Syri-Sucka...+N+This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage+dvd
Old-Fashioned Sci-Fi Movie At Its Best+P+I sound like an old man when I say that there are movies back in the day that are better than the slickest modern production, even when the movies outdate ME.  Maybe because today's filmmakers are so much in love with CGI effects that they feel they can replace little, unimportant things like plot, storyline and character development.  That's why I've steadfastly refused to see Spielberg's version of this classic; I don't want anything to tarnish my memory of what I consider, as a kid growing up and today, one of the best sci-fi films ever made.  Folks hold up "Forbidden Planet" as the quintiscencial science fiction film of all time, and while I'd never quibble with other people's opinion, I believe this movie gives that one a serious run for its money.  First of all, for its relatively short running time, we are given everything that I mentioned earlier, and it doesn't feel rushed.  Purists complain that there were too many changes to the source material, but period films are period films, at least according to the thought of that time, and sci-fi is sci-fi.  To stage a '50s film adaptation of H.G. Wells ACTUALLY IN Victorian England would've been a bit much for the audience seeing it in a cinema.  The changes, once you get settled into the story, are really minor, and actually help add to the enjoyment of the movie.  And they do add breadth to "War Of The Worlds," for we see glimpses of how the rest of the world is faring with the Martian Invasion.  Other countries get their collective butts kicked, and we see it happen live.  We see the failure of a purely military solution to a lifeform that has superior technology and not the least bit of concern for the other beings already on their new home.  Is it a metaphor for the "Red Menace" mentality of the time?  A little bit, but there's also a hint that, for all the power the U.S. Armed Forces has, simple military solutions aren't going to cut it.  In its way, this movie is more progressive in "political" tone than others of its time or type.  Finally, we have the special effects, which actually hold up well to the effects of today.  Yep, digital transfers, done well, allow us to see the wires and supports holding up spaceships, and somehow that alien arm just seems....cheezy, when compared to what's possible with today's techniques and budgets, but they knew how to use what they had.  More importantly, they knew what to show and what not to show.  The aliens themselves were troublesome and balky, not to mention they had the habit of falling apart when moved too much, so we were left with mostly our imagination as the filmmakers used shadow, music, and brief glimpses of the Martians' technology, bodies, and hands to create the horror they wanted us to feel.  Their techniques worked then, and they still work today.  So, what can be said of a movie that's really "timeless?"  Compare some of Hollywood's most lavish productions in recent years to a movie made when special effects REALLY had to be slaved over, and "War Of The Worlds" tops out every single time+dvd
Wonderful film but poor DVD quality+N+I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [...+dvd
The Perfect Storm+P+It's freakin" awesome.  It was perfect from the start all the way to the end.  I was just amazedddd by how it was able to keep me on the edge of the chair the whole time.  Just amazing. and I highly recommend you to watch this movie+dvd
Dust Off Your Bong For This One!+N+Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!+dvd
Footloosin' good time!+P+I don't think that in real life a pastor can actually outlaw dancing in a town but it makes a decent story. Great highlights in the film are when Kevin Bacon taught Chris Penn's character how to dance(lets hear it for the boy!), the fight scene when Bacon and Penn beat up the corny tough guys,and of course the great dancing during the prom which closed the film+dvd
Nice for an out of shape ex-dancer+P+I had quite a bit of dance training as a child and teen, but haven't really danced for 20 years. Also, I'm a complete beginner at hip-hop, but wanted to learn a little just for fun. And it's not like I can't walk around the block, but I'd say I'm a low level of cardio fitness. So this video is absolutely perfect for me right now. I did have to rewind a couple times on my first viewing, and I didn't quite get all the arm and head moves down the first time. But I'm sure in a few sessions I'll be doing the moves with some attitude. It's probably going to get a little boring after a while, but I'll try and extend the fun period by mixing it up with other videos and activities. At some point it is probably going to get too easy to be a good workout, but that will be a while.   She doesn't really break down the individual motions for you technique-wise, but they are pretty easy to pick up on. The instructor is a lot of fun, too.   The only way this could be better is if there were several different workouts on the disc, or maybe options to extend the combination longer. You're not getting a ton of content for your money. But I'm happy with the purchase -- because I just wanted something not too intense and fun, for rainy days and to mix up my workout.   One more thing - I consider some of the stretches questionable and dicey at best. I would never, for instance, use my hand to pull my neck into a stretch like she shows. Be careful with these and modify them if you need to. I substitute different stretches as needed+dvd
I secede+N+"Philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up, 'What's that?'" - Ludwig Wittgenstein  Imagine spending an hour and a half with a teenage version of The Sphynx from "Mystery Men," but without Mr. Furious as a foil. Instead, there's the somewhat compassionate, somewhat opportunistic Pearl Madison, played by Don Cheadle. Sometimes I wasn't sure if Cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted, or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen.  The film is similar to "Mystery Men" in a way, though; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew, and a cast of some of my favorite actors (including Kevin Spacey -- also one of the film's prodcuers) and put them in one of the most frustrating films I've ever sat through.  I guess I'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey, disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors. I wouldn't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany, but it doesn't. When the credits rolled, the only thing I was thinking about was a guy who'd stabbed his girlfriend's retarded brother, and writer/director Matthew Hoge asking, "What's that?" I may as well have watched "Elephant" again.  If exploring suburban angst is your thing, you might like this film. There are better cooked stories out there, though. I watched Larry Clark's "Ken Park" afterward, which was like "The United States of Leland" in a less wealthy neighborhood. Both films were depressing, but I felt so gross after I watched "Ken Park" I promptly returned it to the video store, showered and cleaned my whole apartment. At least I was shocked into action. "The United States of Leland" just had me crawling back into bed.  The soundtrack is okay. The score is by Sunny Day Real Estate's Jeremy Enigk. Jena Malone shoots up heroin to the Pixies, and there's a Dot Allison song I like in the credits that I'd forgotten about. No CD was released.+dvd
Can't wait for the next release! +P+I grew up watching this and just love watching the show now as an adult!  I really love that these came out on DVD and wonder when season 4 is coming out? Hurry!  :)  It's nice to have a show that's clean, interesting, has intelligent characters, and entertaining at the same time!  Woo hoo+dvd
Murder, She Wrote: Season Three+P+It took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" - The Complete Third Season. And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher.   Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent "Syriana" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine ("The Poseidon Adventure") and Martin Balsam ("Psycho"), "Friends" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, "Brady Bunch" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and "Naked Gun" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart ("Titanic"), G.W. Bailey ("Police Academy"), Tess Harper ("Tender Mercies"), Jessica Walter ("Arrested Development"), Hayley Mills ("The Parent Trap"), Bill Macy ("Maude"), Genie Francis ("General Hospital"), Dinah Manoff ("Empty Nest"), and Harry Morgan ("M*A*S*H"). Three stars from the "Star Trek" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original "Star Trek" series), LeVar Burton ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and Kate Mulgrew ("Star Trek: Voyager"). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom "Happy Days", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled "Unfinished Business", which reunited her with "Happy Days" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of "Murder, She Wrote" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on "Murder, She Wrote" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their "Magnum P.I." roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of "Magnum P.I." (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of "Murder, She Wrote" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of "Magnum P.I." is featured as a bonus on season three of "Murder, She Wrote".   The "Magnum P.I."/"Murder, She Wrote" cross-over episodes (titled "Novel Connection" and "Magnum on Ice") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: "Death Stalks the Big Top" parts 1 and 2, "Unfinished Business", "Obituary For A Dead Anchor", "The Corpse Flew First Class", "Crossed Up", "Simon Says, Color Me Dead", "No Laughing Murder", "No Accounting For Murder", and "Murder, She Spoke".   "Murder, She Wrote" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual. I'm sure the fun will continue with season four!  +dvd
Lousy movie+N+I saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also. I was very wrong. The movie is awfu+dvd
Pedigree vs. Filigree.  Filigree wins.+N+Period dramas are, by definition, delicate commodities: they're balanced on that, ahem, "razor's edge" between high brow and just plain fussiness.  I think "Howard's End" is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and English lace.  Milliners, set designers and Helena Bonham Carter's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one+dvd
Good intentions but...+N+A prestigious scientist (Scharwzenegger) is embraced by artificial insemination testing by himself a new pharmacological device.  In spite of the existence of several funny humor blows, it predominates along the picture coarse humor, signed by a permissive and excessively didactic vision of the sex. To be true, there is a potent allegation respect the familiar institution and the motherhood virtue. The fact is that a good chance was wasted about regain the magic of those classic comedies directed by Wilder or Hawks.   But anyway, let' s make an imagination exercise; Mel Brooks directing, with a six hands script written by Robin Williams, Billy Cristal and Danny de Vito would have been a major successful premise.    But all comparisons sound hateful, perhaps. Don `t you?      +dvd
Verry Funny+P+Their research threatened when they fail to nab a grant, two fertility doctors, Alex Hesse (Arnold Schwarzenneger) and Larry Arbogast (Danny DeVito), test their theory and implant Hesse with an embryo. They'd initially planned to terminate the pregnancy after the first 3 months, but Mr. Mom-to-be soon decides to go the whole 9 months ... morning sickness, stretch marks and all. Plus, Hesse is smitten with a fellow scientist (Emma Thompson)+dvd
A poignant and captivating tale+P+Beanie huge fan of all of the three main actors, this ensemble and the writers and directors will everyone who worked on the film made this film a must-see event.  An incredible depiction placed in the Civil War this beautiful tale of love and war, friendship and agony, joy and loss captivate every one of your senses.   The love story between Inman played by Jude Law and Ada played by Nicole Kidman is romantic, poetic and heart wrenching.  Showing what happens to each character separately serves this movie well.  The narration of the letterwriting brings you deeper into the story.  The ending will surprise you+dvd
Exhilerating!+P+I've been doing this workout for several months, and it's still challenging! But everytime I do it, I feel invigorated and strong! Basic kickboxing moves are repeated and built upon, and the instructors' explicit descriptions ensure that each move is done properly and effectively. And her accent is pretty cool!  Legs/Butt, Arms/Shoulders, Cardio/Aerobics, and Abs are all covered... the perfect well-rounded workout! Highly recommneded!+dvd
Deeply Moving+P+I recommend this anime to everyone (as long as you can handle scenes of violence directed at children).  I'm not one of those emotional types of people, but Now and Then is so profound that it even moved me.  The animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is the best I've ever heard (Note, my anime collection is small, so you may wish to take the last statement with a grain of salt).  I was unsure when I purchased this, but after watching it, I am glad that I did.  I do have some minor issues with the ending.  At the end of each episode, which is how it is divided, is a preview of sorts for the next episode.  To me, the preview before the final episode was a bit misleading.  However, this issue is rather minute, and does not warrant a 4 star rating.  Edit: It appears my DVD player skipped at least half of the final episode.  Ignore the comments regarding the final episode+dvd
Classic+P+This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it or heard of it, buy it now+dvd
This is not Alexander+N+Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him.  We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his "true" character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture.  No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves.       Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of Alexander.  From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the more scholarly Robin Lane Fox's "Alexander the Great" there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have.  Certainly the life of Alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film.       For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the "Battle of Chaeronea" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie.  Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer.         Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but "give me a break".  This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him "The Great".         Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless.  And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct.  And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guess work at that.  Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was intrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace.  While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted.  Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros.  He was also allowed to refered to as a "man" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a "man".       At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field.  It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving.        The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander.  A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better.  And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in "Road Runner" cartoons.  One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie:  On his march back "home", he encountered the "Mallians", a fierce and warring nation.  An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving.  Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up.  Three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him.  The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements.  The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked.  He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians.  The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there.  That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore.       Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military stratagey and tactics, a philosopher, muscian, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the "grand tradition".  Maybe Peter Jackson should make a  movie about Alexander.  I'm sure he could get it "right".                       +dvd
A worthy addition to your fitness collection+P+This DVD will get you sweating in a hurry. I really like the interval training  in the Fat Eliminator segment. Alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly, which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser! Minna is excellent at cueing and I like her demeanor. The only thing I really don't like about it (and why it is not a 5-star video for me) is all of the jumping. It is definitely NOT low-impact. If you have knee problems, find another video!+dvd
I Don't Get It+N+There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however.  I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.  Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.  This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there).   It certainly couldn't be because it's funny.  The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.    That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.    That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.  That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.  You get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat.  Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.  If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'.  Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh.  Sincerely,  Bill Cosb+dvd
Great dvd collection+P+It's excellent dvd series to add to your collection . Jimmy walker(JJ) & (Florida)Ester Rolle+dvd
Phenomenal+P+The acting is superb and the dedication to recreating the era is phenomenal. I loved the music even more after I saw the 3rd "extras" DVD and found out about all what went into making it authentic.  And, finally actors who look like the Jewish people of the times! Henry Ian Cusick is simply amazing and real and heartfelt as Jesus.  I've never seen a better rendition.  The main Pharisee was excellent as well.  If you didn't know this movie was a word for word portrayal of the bible you wouldn't think anything was strange about it. It simply comes off as a world class major motion picture. And then after you do know, you are so glad that they did it that way.  I do have to disagree with one point of a reviewer that it "made no apologies" in portraying that the Romans and the Jews put Jesus to death.  I thought it was quite clear that God the Father sent Him to the cross and Jesus accepted that role.  The Romans and the Jews were simply instruments of God and that comes across loud and clear.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  You will get a lot out of it each time you watch it and you will watch it over and over.  The interviews on the "behind the scenes" with the scholars and actors, etc. was excellent.   Make sure you get the 3 CD set to see all the extras+dvd
Where to begin?+N+The numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews.   Political correctness and post Cold War jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie. Some of the historic elements (like Stalin's "not one step back" order, etc) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes, creating an anachronistic mess. Unfortunately, there aren't many Soviet perspective films on Stalingrad to choose from.  Would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that's not from the "usual" U.S. or German WWII perspective. Would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines+dvd
Please let it be the Final+N+Final Destination 3 is hopefully the final installment to this series. They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their "get out of death " free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it? Oh well, anyway, watch this if you have some free time, and if you liked the first two, its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series.+dvd
2025+N+I don't think I'm going to be around in 2025 to give an accurate evaluation .I'f I'm still here I hope I still remember who neil young is, and I'm still rocking in the free world +dvd
A REAL SPECIAL EDITION !!!+P+How many times have you seen  the "special edition" label in a DVD cover? Many times i`m sure, but that could mean anything. From new remastered picture and new digital audio to boring meanenless interviews, but what  about REAL extras? Like deleted scenes, outtakes, i mean real material that realy interest the viewer, and in this cult film's case, THE FANS!  Because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism, we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on! And this special edition brings you all that and more. Not only typical extra  written material, like filmographies and bios, here you can find all the audiovisuals that weren`t used, tv trailers, movie trailers, commercials, interviews, and enough deleted scenes and outtakes to make a whole new movie of its own! I mean everything! fake interviews, presentations on tv shows, video clips, goofing-around trailers, a crazy audio commentary by the "band" during the film, you name it... Even the main page is commented by spinal tap!!!! In conclusion, A REAL DEAL, don`t miss this edition. It`s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material. Amazing realy. Of course the digital and audio could have been better, but the movie is so entertainning that you can pass that+dvd
Really pretty dull for such a button-pushing topic +N+I wasn't impressed by this film.   First of all, I could never "buy" that Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen were a brother and sister.  Nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related.  Nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship.  They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems, because that's how the relationship came across.   Personally, outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry.  Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (like her character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.) The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen's AIDS-stricken boss.  Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film:  he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously suffering from AIDS, and this very fact intimidates the guy he's gone to meet.  The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically...it's a scene that crackles with his anger & pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally.    But aside from that wake-up call, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he's been used by his "sister" to inflate her sense of self-importance, I was long gone, with my head nodding.    Much ado about nothing, frankly.  One star for the soundtrack; one star for the performances of Alan Rickman (what little he has to work with, he shines) and Karl Johnson.  Die-hard Clive Owen fans such as myself; eeeh, pass on this.       +dvd
Wholesome, weird, and dull+N+This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz+dvd
good intentions, plodding drama+N+**1/2  If "North Country" didn't say that it was set in 1989, you'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters, which can only be classified as "Neanderthal" (though that might be an insult to Neanderthals).  And, indeed, you would be right NOT to believe it, for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975, a full decade and a half before the time of the movie.   The drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the Clarence Thomas Senate hearings of 1991 - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie.  It's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that doesn't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie.  With Charlize Theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama, "North Country" tells the true but highly fictionalized story of Lois Jensen (here referred to as Josie Aimes), a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern Minnesota steel mine, only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment.  Here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make Henry Higgins look like Alan Alda in comparison.  When she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there, Aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant, the unenlightened townsfolk, or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs.  Eventually, she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine (in 1988, actually, a full three years before the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill spectacle), resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country.  There is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one, but "North Country" feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world (yes, I realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be, but that still doesn`t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie).  Moreover, "North Country" can't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues.  As a result, the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme, with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero, villain and victim molds with very little shading in between.   Despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story, the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing doesn't have the look and feel of a Lifetime original movie, just with higher priced stars in its cast (Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sissy Spacek, and Richard Jenkins, the dead father from "Six Feet Under").  And while the acting is decent, the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters.  Perhaps it's just that after movies like  "Norma Rae," "Silkwood," and "Erin Brockovich," which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised, "North Country" comes up a day late and a dollar short in the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar department.  +dvd
To the person who said this is not a classic........+P+Now, this movie may not have been known well when it came out in 1985, but, it's popularity grew as much as it has been shown on tv (Countless times).  Now, let's say that John Hughes produced this film;  I bet you that it would have been much better known if it had his name on it; Thus, at the time that this movie came out, John Hughes had some big hits under his belt (I.E. Sixteen Candles, & The Breakfast club to name a couple). If it had Molly Ringwald as the lead actress, then it would have been a bigger hit.  Joyce Hyser, however, wasn't/ isn't a VERY well known (If known) actress.  So, alot of people really didn't pay much attention to this movie.  I mean, what really big hit movies or starring roles did Ms. Hyser have really?  This and a few others were her ONLY starring roles. From what i've seen of her movies besides this one and another, she mostly had small parts.  Like, Does anyone remember seeing Ms. Hyser in the 80's classic "Valley Girl"(Starring Nicholas Cage)?  The ONLY scene she was in was at the prom at the end asking "Where are the cups?", and, that was it.        True, this movie may not be "Fantastic", but, it was ALOT better then some of those cheesy 80's movies that came out around the same time.  I personally think this movie was well-acted, and, cute for it's time.  It's honestly underrated, but, by it showing on HBO, and, Comedy Central ALOT it's popularity grew.  Hence, why they FINALLY released it on Dvd.  It may not be a known "classic", like, "Pretty In Pink", "Sixteen Candles", "The Breakfast Club", and "St. Elmoes Fire", but, it's a classic in it's own right.   I think if better known at the time, people wouldn't of slepted on this classic.       Joyce hyser was wonderful in this role.  And, I think it's honestly her best, and, I am glad it's finally being appreciated after 21 years!  I am soo glad they talked about it on vh1's "I Love The 80's 3-D" last year.        +dvd
Funny Actor is Funny Doctor+P+Patch Admas is a real doctor who make people laugh. He use ballons, a pool with pasta and angel costum for dyingman. Is so funny!

He build special hospital for free+dvd
CSI is the show to watch!+P+I was absolutely, hopelessly hooked on CSI from the first time I watched it.  I started with Season 1 (never saw it on t.v., just started watching the DVDs) and am now on Season Three.  This has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the CSIs is amazing, the story lines are fresh, and it has quickly become my favorite drama (with 24 being a VERY close second).  Only one thing about the other reviews -- yes, Nick's character is gorgeous, but how about that Warrick?  He's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous, but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face, body -- everything.  Grissom is also attractive because he's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything.  Sara has a great voice, and well I could say something great about all of the character's physical qualities, but the most important thing is that the show is captivating, innovative, and fresh.  Season after season, you're drawn into each and every story line.  I love CSI and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years+dvd
Ouitstanding Movie+P+Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo+dvd
An Intruiging Plot, With A good Message+P+Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible.  The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice.  However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this. +dvd
Beware the Fog...literally.+N+"The Fog" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of "what might have been." In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's "The Keep", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good.   Stripped to the bone, "The Fog" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the "terrible secret", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay.   As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped "The Fog" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like "The Keep", "The Fog" never gets any better; unlike "The Keep" it actually gets worse.   On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.  First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.  Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Gag.  Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.  The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.  As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.+dvd
Better Off with Seasons 1-3+N+Without a doubt the season had some pivotal moments. But too few and far between and without a clear story arc for Sydney. The return of Ms. Lena Olin gave it a shot in the arm, but too little too late. Dull villains and dispensing with the cliffhangers were major mistakes that effectively rendered the show toothless. A relentless snorefest considering the brilliance of previous seasons+dvd
Inspiring and artistic - Peacefull and magnificent+P+at LAST !  one film with no fearfull scenes -  (to be entertained doesnt mean someone needs to be frightened.. )  no nightmares ,...!  AT LAST no unnecessary stupid killing.   innocent JUST LIKE A KIDS HEART.   beautifull images original imagination,.... INSPIRING !  SO artistic...  all that critic others wrote, just has to do with technical stuff.   kids dont see a film criticizing it - they watch it with their feeling, and this film is full of love , piece, honesty and respect, hurt and loss.. about feelings.   SO NATURAL....not overplayed! .    I dont want steril films that just keep my eye busy ..   and I really dont think this film is in any way threatening to democratic beleifs... !!! I would say it gives kids the sense of authority...like their parents authority.   I liked that the bad charakters werent over-the-top bad - they were just like people in reality are. they werent unnaturaly "absolute" bad guys and good guys.   kids need to learn these things. that there arent just bad guys and just good guys.  they need to see that good guys can do bad things and bad guys arent always totally bad guys but can be good also..    I LOVED Dinotopia and am gratefull that I had a chance to see it. will see the other movies with dinotopia too..  +dvd
Nice boxset but the packaging! Ugh!+P+I won't go on about the contents of this nice boxset as it has all been addressed already, but I thought I should add that upon receiving my shipment today I was dismayed to find all 3 discs rolling around free from their hubs!  This poor packaging virtually guarantees damage to the DVDs...If it wasn't limited I would demand a replacement, but I'm not sending mine back and hope they still have one to replace it.  The replacement would more than likely have the same loose DVD problem anyway.  Boxset 4 stars, packaging (disc protection rated only) 0 stars.  Disappointed+dvd
Magical and sparkling duo.+P+The Harts, Max and Freeway made this one of the best series from the past.The chemistry between Wagner and Powers exploded on the screen.A modern day version of The Thin Man series of yester year, with William Powell and Merna Loy.They solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get untangeled.Not without the help of Max, who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with Shirley Temple. Can not wait for the third season dvd+dvd
Funny funny funny+P+He is simply the funniest human on the planet at this time.  I have, literally, laughed so hard at times I thought I might have a heart attack.+dvd
The Office Does Not Dissappoint!+P+The BBC's version of the Office is a refreshing, intelligent depiction of today's business environment. Laced with sarcasm and gags that are so astounding they defy comprehension, it is worth suspening disbelief for optimal enjoyment! David Brent's portrayal of the idiot boss is genius. And his supporting characters - namely Gareth and Tim, are wonderful. After working in a corporation for many years, I could identify with many of the issues that arose and wish that I was able to respond in the ways that these characters respond. One takeaway, which I consider a serious one, is that honesty is underrated. Brent repeatedly puts his foot in his mouth for the things he says and many times, it's embarrassing to watch. But the beauty of Brent is his honesty and it makes his obnoctiousness tolerable. He tells it like it his, albiet distorted, but you always know where he stands (or is trying to stand!). Two thumbs way up for this box set which cleverly combined sharp wit with doses of reality. Loved the ending too+dvd
this one deserves a big fat zero+N+this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?!  you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far+dvd
These are the worst ever!+N+My son loves "real life" trucks and big machines, so I thought these would be fun for him to watch. They are not, in fact they don't even hold his attention. Dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids. Just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on Dave. I have since bought the I Love CAT Machines series and they are fantastic+dvd
Where's the funny part?+N+I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.+dvd
kholuj i stavlennik imperializma+P+This is not a film of Realism, but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of Russian culture would understand (Russian or non)--not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment, societal coldness, or irrational revenge, which it is on the surface.  But if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for $3 on Netflix and it ruined your evening then I would suggest that you stick with The Stroll ( Progulka ) or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern Russia.  Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but        sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience.  Most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself.  No one blames you for that, and I really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway, unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography.      Sometimes movies do fail to make a point, but this is not one of them in my view.   Basically, if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble.  Trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first.  Do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a Tarkovsky fan.  I would say that Tarkovsky is an influence on Zvyagintsev, but Zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do.        Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises.  This is not a digital camera, you know.  You have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy.    Amazon reviews are at you disposal.  Make your decision.  Rent it and then buy it...or do not.                 Why discourage others who have not had the chance to  view it themselves?  Do not give into Big brother.  We are a democracy and we are strong. Think and evolve.                          +dvd
Ironic humor+P+This film can be interpreted any number of ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy. Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite skill+dvd
action packed and very entertaining movie+P+The great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.The plot is easy to follow and all is the action and I think JJ abrams did a great job as director.This dvd is worth looking+dvd
Winkler was the good part+N+If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development".  Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans.  Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves".  A movie for history's circular file+dvd
The Brat Pack and those enormous granny panties+N+This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.   +dvd
Fact is stranger than Fiction+N+I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.+dvd
Poor History and a screenplay over-dramatic+N+I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it+dvd
I love the O.C.+P+At first: When I bought the first season of the OC i did not know it. But then I watched the first episode and I loved it. All the Characters play so realistic. Each episode is different. Sometimes it's funny but is also often serious. After I watched all episodes    I felt really sad, because I wanted to know how it goes on. But know the second season is out so I have more than 40 hours OC to watch.   Of Course there are Extras in the box like interviews and something like that. And the quality of the discs is also great.   I have never bought better DVDs than this. The OC is the best you can buy on DVD. And one of the best points is the very great price because you get almost 20 hours.  +dvd
Amazing combat sequences+P+Given that no special effects were used and that the film took two years to complete.... the aerial combat sequences are fantastic.  The plot-lines are trivial, but universal.  I think that the horrors of a seemingly endless war in Europe are well presented.  This quite an enjoyable film, particularly if you are conversant with Howard Hughs dedication to get it made+dvd
30 year-old...going on 40+P+Perhaps Kurosawa's most darkly comic, "fun" movie.  Based very loosely on a 1929 Dashiell Hammett (author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man) novel entitled, Red Harvest, Yojimbo employs many of the same conventions.  Namely, the nameless protagonist who finds himself in the supremely corrupt town, and, warned to leave, stays on to punish the guilty.  Mainly for his own cynical amusement.    The Yojimbo character is the worldly anti-hero, and the only truly self-aware person in the entire movie.  He sees power-hunger, avarice, and cowardice for what they are and knows all too well how to manipulate the two warring factions into destroying each other.  He is a ronin, a masterless samurai.  Literally translated, it means "wave-man" or one who has been cast adrift on the waves.  No master to serve but his own need to eat, his own whim, and no devices beyond his sword and resourcefulness.    It is easy to discount the Yojimbo character as completely cynical, as a man loyal to none, who kills for the mere implementation of a plan, or for profit.  But for as skewed his morality may be, I cannot agree.  The Yojimbo character invariably throughout the course of the film makes moral choices, but denies all sentimentality in making them and claims (though probably falsely) other reasons for his actions: he frees the woman kept prisoner by the sake brewer and helps her escape with her family (giving them the money given him by one of his yakuza bosses);  he spares the life of the foolish farm-boy who ran away to be a gambler only to cry for his mother at his first brush with death;  and upon hearing the news that the inn-keeper (his only ally up to this point) has been imprisoned, he nearly rushes off to face down the dangerous and gunslinging Tatsuya Nakadai and co., armed with only a small knife.    It is as if he views "normal" people differently.  As if the samurai and yakuza are classes of people, like himself, who have accepted this violent way of life.  That, having made that choice, anything that comes their way--including death or dismemberment--should not be a surprise or thought twice about.  Toshiro Mifune's character may kill an evil man for amusement or for his own end, but he would not harm or rob an innocent man or debauch an innocent woman.  He may be "a hungry dog, following the smell of blood", but it is not the blood of honest people.    In The Dain Curse, another of Dashiell Hammett's books about the character from Red Harvest (known in several books and two dozen short stories as only "the Continental Op"--an operative for the Continental Detective Agency), the nameless man is told, smilingly, by the book's heroine that he is a monster...but a nice one, and good to have around when things are dark.  I think that very much sums up the Yojimbo character as well, and also about how the character sees himself.  Some critic in a review I read wrote that Tarantino does not make movies about violence so much as he makes movies about violent people, and their lives and thoughts and beliefs.  I would say that Yojimbo and its excellent, hilarious, and insightful sequel Sanjuro certainly fall into that category.    I think that Yojimbo is often written off by pseudo-intellectuals as Kurosawa's foray into "popcorn cinema", but I couldn't disagree more.  I believe that this favorite movie of mine was Kurosawa's expression of the philosophy of Action, of Confrontation, of a 1960s jaded-but-not-corrupted Good versus Evil.    Also, I would like to add, it has one of the BEST musical hero's themes in all of cinema+dvd
Not many better+P+He is not a new comedian; right now he is the Man! What a range with clean or dirty jokes/stories. Mr. Harvey is one of the best out there.. OH, this DVD...Great+dvd
This movie is a clunker+N+Wasted talent.  None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying.  Some funny stuff.  Craig Ferguson can do better.  Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte.  Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters+dvd
hey, did any of you dudes catch that they ripped off the plot from clueless?+N+this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade, with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic.  fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of WHY i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind, but it was a mess.+dvd
Fails to come to a boil+N+Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel.  Lumi Cavazos is a likeable Tita,struggling with her forbidden passion for Pedro.She's a sympathetic character&conveys her pain with her eyes.For a talented actress,I wonder what has become of her since.  Marco Leonardi is not as sympathetic as Pedro.He comes across as a cheating scoundrel,causing pain for both his wife&his forbidden lover.One wonders why Tita loves him so much,except that it's forbidden.Marco Leonardi is,however,being true to the book.He uses Tita for his own pleasure;instead of bravely marrying her,he is a coward in marrying her sister&cheating on her.  The movie renders less magical,or powerful,the scenes in the book.Instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti Western.One expects to see John Wayne riding to Tita's rescue.  The magical scenes are hardly convincing,even for their time.The movie does have an excellent soundtrack.It's far inferior to the delectable,sensual novel+dvd
Cheetah Girls +P+I love this movie i watched  a lot and i cant wait to get the Cheetah Girls 2 movie in Nov or Dec they  my favorite movie and i  all the girls in it they did they parts well+dvd
A merciful two star rating; Look for future Arena Football Def. Coor. Stan Davis as 1 child actor & funny bit about Cheap Trick+N+Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake+dvd
A misstep to be missed+N+Unfortunately, this freshman effort from writer/director Maria Maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism.   Littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances, "Two Girls in Love" is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment.   For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, "My Summer of Love" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- "But I'm A Cheerleader" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, "Better Than Chocolate" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality.   The only incredible thing about "Two Girls in Love" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale+dvd
Brat Pack+P+I just have to ask how the other reviews can comment on how sloppy the package is when it isn't even released yet. They haven't seen it?  The package is very cool, it is a notebook 3 ring binder with 3 protective sleeves for the discs and 1 for the music CD. This is a great package for those who grew up with the brat pack era.  I know what the packaging looks like because I work for the company who made them+dvd
Robben Ford In Europe, Again!+P+Well I am very surprized, frankly, that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet, so I will!  This DVD was released in May 2005 and is the first real taste of Robben Ford live since his excellent live set in Baden-Baden Germany in the 1990s as part of the "Ohne Filter-Musik Pur" series-and they are all great! In this Paris set in 2001 Robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer, super bassist (check his solo in "Help the Poor") and, for the first time, keyboards. I can't praise this performance enough. Robben exhibits his style masterfully, without a lot of show, and demonstrates how he has successfully combined Jazz (especially Jazz Sax) with Chicago Electric Blues.  Ford started around the Bay Area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the "Charles Ford Band" (named for his Dad) during the end of the Blues Power revival of the 1ate 1960s. He got to play with Charlie Mussellwhite and then Miles Davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops. I love the part in the interview (a great bonus feature!) where he said Miles liked him when he played his own stuff, his own way...not what Miles had originally thought he'd play.  Well this DVD is well produced, has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent, as you would expect from the Inaukstik people! The opening track "Prison Of Love" one of Fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance. It's a cool Jazz-Blues. The top selection of the DVD is "Help The Poor" from his most famous and acclaimed recording "Talk To Your Daughter". This version is great the the solos are as good as you'll ever hear from anyone! I always thought this and "Born Under A Bad Sign" were Ford's greatest songs ever! "Chevrolet" is a remake of a Donovan song "Hey Gyp"(Ford is a master of re-doing old tunes, especially blues, in a new groove and extending them!) This song was done by the Animals as well in the late 1960s. It is great!  "Start It Up" is a Ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster, which he plays through most of this set-that's also unusual. His version of Mike McDonald's "Nothing To Nobody" is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure. The minor key blues offering "Moonchild Blues" is perhaps the second greatest tune on the DVD, it sounds very close to the Howlin' Wolf classic "Who's Been Talking"! You just want to keep on playing it!  I highly recommend this DVD. It is the best new Blues inspired DVD of 2005 and a great addition to anyone's collection. If you only get one Robben Ford DVD, this is it! Great product and interesting bonus interview+dvd
rent, don't buy+N+I rented this thinking it was an Audrey Tautou flick, but it isn't.  She's front-and-center on the cover line-up, but she's only in a few scenes.  That isn't the real reason why I think that this movie is so-so.  There really isn't much in this movie that I haven't seen done elsewhere.  I kept thinking that I've seen other movies do this or that better.  Then again, I've seen a lot of foreign and independant films, so I've gotten a bit picky at times. Nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one.  It's a mediocre flick, I don't know why it got rave reviews.  I remember seeing the DVD in a sale bin at a discount store for $5 but I thought it would be a waste, because seeing it once was enough and I don't feel like I'll ever need to see it again+dvd
Waste of time+N+I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe. +dvd
Did You All Miss the Boat?+N+After viewing the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao I must agree with the March 10th, 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid "B" film.  When I was growing up I spent many hours in movie theaters watching Fantasy and Sci-Fi films.  George Pal movies were always among my favorites and still are.  To make statements that the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao was George Pal's greatest film is unfounded.  Have these people ever watched the Time Machine or  War of the Worlds?   If we are talking about great Fantasy or Sci-Fi movies, which George Pal should be remembered for, then you don't get much better than these two.  The only credit to this film is the scene where Dr. Lao shows the town's people the movie clips of the Roman city being destroyed by a vocanic eruption.  The eruption scenes are taken from another George Pal classic fantasty film, Atlantis the Lost Continent.  Now there is a great film to entertain the children.  The only problem with Atlantis the Lost Continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on DVD.  For those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past, drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market+dvd
Could be one of the best...+P+I sat front row for this show in Vegas, you even see me about 5 times during the comedy central version of the show. Dane even gave me a high 5 (that missed barely) and was thankfully cut...lol.   I can tell you the CC version had ALOT cut out, and was still VERY funny. I am really looking forward to seeing if the added material is the really rauchy HILARIOUS stuff. Sean Rouse was just as funny if not better than Dane... but it was VERY racy... I'd definitely buy if that stuff was back in... probably will anyways to remember my first appearance on Comedy Central too!  You'll love it either way, but man I hope they decided to show the whole sets of each guy+dvd
Fun, fast and challenging (if all done together) :->+P+This is a great workout as a whole (or more than one segment at least).  Michelle Dozois (Shape dvd's) is energetic and enthusiastic without going overboard.  She is motivating and cues very well.  The five segments are Slow and Steady Burn, Carb Killer, Power Blast, Interval Burn and Metabolism Booster.  The thing I like about this is that you can customise your own workout or do them in order.  There's great music to also keep you motivated and give you a good workout routine.  The only problem is that you really should do a minimum of two workouts in a row or you won't get as much benefit as possible.  One segment is fine on it's own if you are topping up from another routine you do.  But overall, I think everyone will like this because it's great if you are short on time and because you can mix it up, it doesn't get boring.  I love it+dvd
Hugh Laurie is the best actor on television - he has no equal+P+House is the best show on television. There's never been a medical show like this - ever, and I've seen just about all of them. And to have someone of Hugh Laurie's caliber and immense talent is such a great treat for viewers. There is nothing this man can't do. Brilliant and genius are overused words, but in his case, they more than apply. His background in so many British comedies prepared him well for the role of House, but what's so amazing is how he can go from making you laugh one minute, to playing pain and drama like nobody's business. The DVD's are so clear and sharp, and those mesmerizing blue eyes of his are just mind boggling! When the light hits them a certain way, you cannot look at anything or anyone else in the scene. Hugh, if you're reading this I know you hate hearing it, but you are brilliant and sexy as hell!!!! The best show on television, bar none+dvd
The Governator shows his soft side+P+This movie gets spoofed in JibJab's short film "Ah-nold for Governor" in which the Governator cites the movie as evidence of his gubernatorial political qualifications.  Hey, it's a lot more convincing than John Kerry's.  Especially since this movie is so irresistible.  You just have to see the scene in which John Kimble reads the kids a poem about clouds.  (Incidentally, it's Spring Morning" from A.A. Milne's book, "When We Were Very Young.") Schwarzenegger displays a Richard Belzer kind of tenderness.  Then he will turn around and beat the living daylights out of the abusive father in the film ("He fell down.  You all say the same thing.")  Kimble's relationship with Grace is moving and convincing and his camaraderie with his female partner Phoebe is evocative of Detectives Benson and Stabler in "Law & Order: SVU".  I love the scene in which he makes up an entire background (something cops are used to doing) and Phoebe pretends to have an Austrian accent (she's almost more convincing than Ah-nold.)  The childrens' loyalty and response to Kimble is a joy to see.  Schwarzenegger's work with children and his natural charisma make this fish-out-of-water story work.  Anyone who's ever taught children will empathize with Kimble's disastrous first day.  There are great villains in this piece too, including a mother-in-law from hell.  My favorite lines...  Phoebe: You're not so tough without your car, are you?  Detective John Kimble: There *is* no bathroom.  Joseph: Boys have a penis, girls have a vagina! Detective John Kimble: Thanks for the tip.  Tina & Rina: Our mom says our dad is a real sex machine.  Joseph: My dad's a gynecologist. He looks at vaginas all day long.  Detective John Kimble: I Have a headache. Lowell: It might be a tumor. Detective John Kimble: It's not a tumor!  Miss Schlowski: What did it feel like to hit that S.O.B.? Detective John Kimble: It felt great. (I love how the principal then starts practicing her right hook once Kimble leaves her office.  You don't want to mess with this woman anyway, right hook or no.)  Detective John Kimble: Just don't throw up on me. Phoebe: Nah, it's OK, I'm not gonna throw up on you. But I am gonna kiss you!  Detective John Kimble: I really appreciate your honesty. You happen to know someone that is not better than me? Dominic: I don't know that many people.  Detective John Kimble: They're 6-year-old kids. How much trouble can they be? Phoebe: On second thought, take the gun.  Crisp's mother is buying a heap of pediatric medication Cullen Crisp: The boy's not sick. Eleanor Crisp: Doesn't hurt to take precautions. Cullen Crisp: Mother, you are going to make him sick. You stuffed all this crap down my throat for years, and there was nothing wrong with me! Eleanor Crisp: That's why there was nothing wrong with you. Cullen Crisp: Now, how can you argue with that?  Great comedy.+dvd
Unbox Sucks+N+It tells me 'no device to download to'.  Amazon, debug your product before you take people's money!! You are acting like Microsoft.  There is no way to report this to Amazon. Does anybody there care anymore?+dvd
Awful+N+The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about+dvd
It's about time!+P+Finally, in this day of PC pablum, someone tells the REAL history of the Confederate soldier! You'll learn little-known facts about the major players, including General Lee of course, but more importantly, this set focuses heavily on the average man in the ranks and why he chose to fight. Daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used. The real reasons and motivations for fighting are explored and what life was like after the war when men had to go home in defeat to often-devastated homes. Highly recommend! It's a must for serious students of the war and anyone who wants an authentic look at the period+dvd
It's ok.+N+I only bought this one for the song by Jerry Orbach.  The first 2 DVDs were better+dvd
John Tucker lives???+N+Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as "Bring it on", "Clueless", "Mean Girls" and, especially the superior "Heathers".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, "John Tucker Must Die" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. "JTMD" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. "Heathers" = 5 stars. "Mean Girls" = 4 stars. "Bring it on" = 4 stars. "Clueless" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that "John Tucker Must Die" doesnt have.. +dvd
Another teen movie, by adults, that hates kids.+N+Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - "John Tucker Must Die," like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: "Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs." That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year.   But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous "Laguna Beach" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. "JTMD" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of.  Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher.  Is this a satire, as "JTMD" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what "JTMD" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven.  Instead we have a fourth, "smart" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, "Taming of the Shrew" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid!  We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable.   Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about "Islamofascists," these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be. +dvd
Sturges at His Best+P+Years ago, in the days before cable, there were six or seven television stations in Chicago.  Only a few of them had programming late at night.  There weren't channels to flip between; when you found a movie you liked, you actually watched it.  One weekend night, I came home late and found my sister watching the late-late show on WGN.  "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it. A good Sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park. And this movie is as wild a ride as any Sturges movie.  I have seen this movie a number of times over the last 30 years and each time I am almost doubling over with laughter.  I can't wait to get it on DVD.  For a few years in the 1940s Preston Sturges was a brilliant shinning star.  As far as I am concerned, he never shone brighter than he did in this "Miracle."+dvd
ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS WATCHING MICHAEL JACKSON DRY-HUMP HOWDY DOODY+N+I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (...+dvd
Pathetic+N+Can't remember when I've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this.   A has-been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer, down on his luck.  The writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property, and hides his car trying to escape a Finance Co. The  threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine.   In one early scene they have a funeral, casket and all, for a monkey.  Yuk.    Gloria Swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script, though she despises movies that "talk".   She waves her hands about, and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene. She falls for the screen writer, William Holden, and won't let him out of her sight.  The film was made in 1950, and Swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50, not exacty over the hill (if we look at many of today's movie stars.)   But she's treated in the film as though she much, much older.  I thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so, but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film.  My heavens, at 50 she could still be in movies, and from the amount of money she apparently had, didn't need to be living in such a dark, creepy house.  Film didn't make sense.     Sorry I bought it.  It was ridiculous.     +dvd

The novelty's worn off, and it's left as a former shell of itself+N+On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent.+dvd
pretty good+P+This is a very basic video showing you what you need for a basic sensual dance. I was expecting a little more and the porn at the end was a lil surprising and unneccessary. Overall though it does show you a basic dance that you can build from+dvd
I felt like a beginner!+P+I had been working out on a stability for about 6 months and I thought this would be a change of pace for me and figured being a "beginner" workout I wouldn't have a problem. Boy was I wrong! I felt like a true beginner as I worked through the routine and was wobbling all over. Regardless, I still "felt" the results of the workout.  It took me several repetitions to start to control myself on the ball and feel like I was actually mastering the moves. This routine now has a permenant place in my exercise rotation and I love all that I'm able to do. Don't be scared away. Stick to it and you'll love the way it makes you feel and the results you'll get+dvd
Worthy of the wealth it garnered, and the awards...+P+I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912. I've been a Titanic buff for 50 years now, and read most of the books. However, last weekend I went to a museum to see "Artifacts of the Titanic", a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down, things once connected to the White Star Line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater. It was incredibly moving and sad. Connected with the exhibit was an IMAX showing of James Cameron's "Ghosts of the Abyss." The "Titanic" director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release, and in 2001 he rented a Russian ship, two submersible submarines, and two robotic cameras, and went down to the wreck himself, taking along actor Bill Paxton from the movie. The resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent. If you get a chance to see it, or the salvaged items, don't pass it up. Meanwhile, the movie works. So have most of the earlier versions, and so have most of the books, because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes. The fictional parts of Cameron's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster, in my view. Seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again, on a big screen.+dvd

Lousy DVD from Hart Sharp Video+N+This review refers to the uncut DVD version. Like the other reviewers here, I loved this movie. The movie I would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress Juliette Marquis (from Ukraine no less). The image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video. I can undertand and accept that. This DVD however is a lousy Pan and Scan version. Some movies can be Pan and Scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future TV transfers in mind. But this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and didn't make room for transfer to fullscreen TV. It is intensely frustrating to watch this damned DVD. You watch noses talking to half faces, half faces talking to ears, heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly. I am furious at the studio a__holes at Hart Sharp Video who sanctioned this Pan and Scan monstrosity. And they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen. To add insult to injury, they show pictures on the back cover and the insert, of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the Pan and Scan cropped crap. Hart Sharp Video goes straight to my list of Never Buy From Again. By all means see this movie - at the theater. Or wait till a more responsible company releases a new DVD edition+dvd
Another disappointing Marvel movie+N+Who's idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?  Chris Evans's portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm.  Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies?  They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters.  This movie was somewhat good, but it didn't feel all that great.  So far, this movie is just another of Marvel's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher.  I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel's chracters go back into hiding.  Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic.  Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie+dvd
Yuck!+N+This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck+dvd
Ramtha Who???+N+You know it's interesting, when you open the Ramtha web site of the "School of Wisdom", one finds a high school  essay in NeoPlatonic Metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats, however when you hit the link that says who is Ramtha, you get a "this information is not available" message, kinda makes you go, HHMMMMMMM????!!!   now don't get me wrong folks, Edgar Cayce and the author of a Course in Miracles might have tapped into something, but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative, it kind of reminds me of the lines in the Revenge of the Sith movie that Palpatine gave to Anakin to turn him to the dark side!!!!!  You know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik, you know esteemed Jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the Sith; or even Tolkien's Saruman,  hey folks get Christopher Lee's opinion of the DVD before you fork over your hard earned bucks, and uh...do a search on this Ramtha spirit, er channeled, er thingy!!! Live Long and Prosper!!+dvd
Awww...+P+This movie is incredible. It has a great way of deminstating how judgemental people that shouldn't be judgemental are. This movie catches your heart and you get wrapped up in it. 5 STARS for sure. Its was an incredible movi+dvd
Awesome. A must have for anime comedy fans+P+Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard "The magnificent world". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon).   Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers).  Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile?   Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond "Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star"? no, ofcourse not.   yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel "alternative world" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart.  For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend "Niea under 7" and "His and Her Circumstances".   animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4  Total= 4.4 Star+dvd
Kylie Minogue Showgirl DVD+P+Another great concert put out by Kylie. She covers a little bit of everything from her career. The only complaint I may have is that there was a spot where the concert drug. Too bad that the fans in the U.S. have been deprived by her talent all these years. I wish that she would put out a DVD with all of her videos, Something like the Ultimate Kylie she released last year. I hope she keeps it going for years to come+dvd
The nastiness against the epic innocence!+P+A haunting portrait which reflects the anguish universe of the childhood, its fears, disillusions and hopes. The finding of a wild child under the ground, will become the dramatic premise to confront two visions and fortunately opposite ways of living.  A honest script. Suggestive dialogues, admirable photography and enrapturing shot angles.       +dvd
Good but German version from Amazon.de is better.....than UK SE+N+Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide.....+dvd
Buckethead Has It All!+P+This is an amazing DVD! Buckethead covers the entire spectrum! He covers everything from science fiction, horror, zombies, classical art, pop art, funk, jazz, rock, alternative, progressive, etc. He is definately the Frank Zappa of the new century. His guitar playing is incredible and his compositions are mind boggling. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I have seen so far (I am only through the first disc). But the navigation was no problem and extremely interesting. I loved the announcers voice! I was immediately smiling and sometimes laughing outloud! I just love his take on things. Just the video for the Wheels of Torment is worth the price of the DVD. An amazing video. How did they take the classical painting of hell and disect it and animate it and throw in images of Buckethead playing guitar - or was it a mandolin? I also loved the Ballad of Buckethead with Les Claypool - He's alive, He's half dead, Folks just call him Buckethead! Great! The Dental Commander was interesting animation and the Bootsy Collins - Funky Express Card was so damned funny I couldn't stop laughing. As well as the with the clips of the japanese monsters invading Tokyo. I also loved hearing his early demos for Guitar Player. Absolutely amazing guitar and composition. I really recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the guitar work of Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Mike Keneally, Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew, John Petrucci, etc. This guy is in the same league and then some. A very important guitar hero and composer. This DVD is worth ten times the cost. Don't miss it+dvd
Absolute excellence+P+Throne of Blood is a masterpiece by one of the world's greatest film makers at the height of his powers.   Only Kurosawa could take the essence of Shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force. Yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of Noh (a stagy traditional Japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized). A seeming contradiction, dynamism and static-ness yet Kurosawa masters both in the same medium.  As usual; acting, writing, cinematography, sound, direction and production are all pitch perfect.   In this second Shakespearian based film by Kurosawa, focus is on the interplay of fate,  free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together. On a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword. In short what goes around comes around. What comes around for Toshiro Mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow, perfect direction by Kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events (pun intended...see the movie you'll understand).  Bonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of Donald Richie. Few people are more knowledgeable about film and Japanese film then he. The commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself.   As usual Criterion presents its film in pristine condition. Some may complain that Criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer. You cannot go wrong. One Kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy, punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price, really quite a deal if you look at it that way.+dvd
What a pity!+N+I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair.+dvd
Bland, predictable and cliche...+N+There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.    Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart, oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all.  In fact, that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark side to any of the characters.  They're all basically harmless Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son.  There are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to him.  There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't want to hurt the feelings of your host.    The ending also relies on another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable.  This film might've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death, instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse, narcissism.  One wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him.    A more accurate title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll, might be: "The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old Man." +dvd
Very disappointed and frustrated+N+Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.   To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.   I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun+dvd
Unbelievable, but enjoyable+P+Yep, it's another romantic comedy ... with a twist.   Enter an account exec who, thru an accident w/ a hairdryer at home can hear women's thoughts.   This is a pure bunk, pure enjoyment film .. and Mel Gibson addresses it with style. While the film may not win any big awards, it's great fun to watch again and again. And I'm not one who's big on romance comedies.   Want to grin and chuckle thru the evening? Give this one a look. Suitable for the whole family, but it's likely that kids under 12 will find it boring.   recommended.  ~ P +dvd
CRUEL EXAMPLE OF CULTURAL IMPERIALISM AT ITS WORST: WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS+N+I too was mesmerized by this documentary, as an educator and student of child psychology, etc. THen I heard the running commentary, especially the remarks of the cameraman, and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is: using despised children for selfish purposes=prostitution.  THe cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b#tch (his words) and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls. The inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise. Often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm, as Mr. Oscar Wilde noted.  This despicable film takes kids, uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman, divides families and friendships, exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition, like Liza Dolittle, without hope of going either back or forward. The pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling+dvd
Had Promise, but Failed to Deliver.+N+I have to agree with the other reviewers. "Legend of the Rangers" looked promising but ultimately didn't deliver.  The sets and effects are excellent and the actinng's not bad. And of course it was great seeing Andreas Katsulas reprise his role as Narn ambassador, now citizen, G'Kar, however these three elements couldn't save the film. The mysterious alien race threatening the Liandra's crew were too much like the Shadows of the series.   If you're a die-hard B-5 fan you'll want this film, but if you're looking for an introduction to B-5 go with the season box sets.   All-in-all not JMS' best. Which is sad because it had promise+dvd
left a bad taste+N+I searched for reviews of this movie before I saw it, and didn't find any. People I talked to had not seen it, but had heard it was good. So I finally sat down and watched it. The acting was top notch. It was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships. One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits.  On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women. Kathy Bates' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a "don't push me" type. While much of this was funny, this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground. In spite of this I enjoyed the first part of the movie. That is until the surprise ending. While this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler, the ending involved unwitting cannibalism. This made me sick, and I felt sick a long time after watching it. Had I known how sour the ending would be, I never would have watched this movie+dvd
Signs, the movie+P+Good quality film.  Amazon kept me informed of shipment.  Good servic+dvd
Heartburn  or  Men..beware ! Most women only want to breed !+N+This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant &quot;homemaker&quot;. If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too+dvd
War and Rembrance+P+"War and Remberance" is a is the conclusion to Herman Wouk's "Winds of War". The characters we follow in this series are ficitional though the setting of pre-world two and the carnage of the actual war is real. The story is true to life in every aspect. The actors in the story are excellent! The story of the Henry's, the Jastrow's is heartbreaking. The concentration camp settings are so real,one is not likely to forget the personal side war of Hitler. This story makes you ask how did one person, Hitler, who indeed was mad, "weild so much power?" This series is well worth the watching.  +dvd
We love Brainy Baby at our house. +P+I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.    And the toys.......he LOVES them.  "Hello, Brainy Baby!"  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.    We love Brainy Baby at our house. +dvd
Excellent learning tool+P+Wow, what an excellent DVD! Since the first time we put it on for our 20 months old daughter, she has been hooked to it. This is an excellent DVD for kids starting from 6 months. Lots and lots of color and classical music keep the kid busy constantly. The combination of colors, objects and music greatly enhances their ability to think and relate to everyday things. I highly recommend this to all parents. My wife found out about this while searching for Baby Einstein DVD.+dvd
Gag me with a spoon!!!+N+I found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent.  It should be rated X.  I didn't know "Johnny" could stoop so low.  It made me want to barf!!+dvd
Classic - Peyton Place+P+If you liked Peyton Place, you will love this movie.  Jeff Chandler does a great job portraying "the publisher" of Allison's book as well as her lover for the moment.  This also has a variety of things happening in Peyton Place that you will find interesting+dvd
Let There Be peace On Earth+P+This powerful and thought evoking film depicts an actual incident which took place on Christmas Eve, 1914.  The film juxtaposes the great beauty of Christ's birth with the unspeakable human tragedy of war.    The events chronicled in this film took place on the killing fields of France where The French and Scottish armies were entrenched across from the German army.  Here these powerful armies slaughtered each other for four years never giving up more than 25 miles of teritory either way.  On this special Christmas eve, the first of the Great War, these armies saw a chance to stop the killing to celebrate the birth of the prince of peace.  As the soldiers emerged from their trenches, littered with human filth and rotting corpses, one can not help but sense an immediate rebirth.  In doing so, they recognized their common humanity and fulfilled the promise of Christ's birth which is "Let There Be Peace on Earth".  The film is wonderfully acted and the attention to detail is spectacular.  The most moving scene of this film is when the Scottish priest celebrates mass in latin (as was done back then) to the Sottish, French and German soldiers.  While all speak their own language they were able to experience a spritual moment in the common language of the Catholic mass.  This simple act of mass reminds the viewer of the good that comes when human beings focus on the commonalities that bind us and not the differences that tend to destroy us.  I highly remommend this wonderful film to anyone who believes in the inherent promise of humanity and the power of good versus evil. +dvd
Violent, thought provoking, and disturbing all in one.+P+Gantz is a very violent anime that aired on Japanese television only after SERIOUS editing. Gantz follows the story of Kei, a young student who somehow finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. His long-lost friend, Kato, shows up in the subway where Kei is also waiting for a train, just in time to see a homeless man fall onto the tracks below. Being the kind soul that Kato is, he runs to the man's aid, and after spotting Kei on the platform, calls for his help as well. Peer pressure wins and Kei too joins the struggle. After saving the man, they are stuck on the tracks as a passing train comes barreling down the tracks at them. In a battle of legs versus wheels, it is obvious who wins, and the oncoming train almost instantly decapitates Kei and Kato.  At the very brink of death, Kei's last thoughts are "why me?" which eventually leads to "this is the way it's gotta be," as he see himself falling to the ground below. At the last possible instant, the machine known only as Gantz rescues Kei and Kato and places them in a room with other "survivors." A countdown shows up on the large black globe known as Gantz, and the game begins. Kill or be killed...the once hunted has become the hunter, and Kei and Kato find themselves surrounded by bloodthirsty monsters that would love nothing more than to make them their next meal.   The bloodshed is enormous, the bodies are piling up, and behind it all is Gantz. While stuck in a purgatory state, Kei and Kato realize that they are neither truly alive nor truly dead. Live through the game and you are free to go, until the next round begins. Fail at the game, and you will face a fate worse than death.  Filled with LOTS of internal monologues on the part of Kei, Gantz is a series that allows for incredible character development. In the space between heaven and hell, Kei must fight his own demons as well as those that he is battling against. Loyalty and hormones come into question, and the battles continue as more "survivors" enter the mix.  Cursing and nudity are littered everywhere in this series, but it does nothing to take away from its quality. Gantz is definitely not something for the kiddies, but it is a great series for the anime junkie in all of us. Season two was recently released, so let the games continue...+dvd
"You're going down Burnhead" ???+N+I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.   Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....   In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.   The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series). Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...   In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  No masterpiece here... 2 Stars+dvd
Fun and entertaining+P+I cannot help but laugh every time I see people bashing each other over a movie. Disliking a certain film is one thing. But for somebody to go out of their way and flagrantly insult a total stranger over their enjoyment of a particular film they happened to hate is unnecessary and immature. Amazon should police these reviews a bit more seriously.  "Critters" is a fond and harmless throwback to the sort of monster movie so prevalent in the mid-1950s sci-fi boom. I cannot so easily classify the plot as straight-up horror, because it really isn't. This is more of a hodgepodge. You get a smattering of horror, comedy, and science fiction all rolled up within a singular and satisfying package. I caught this in a theater with my father twenty years ago, and it has always remained a guilty pleasure of mine. None of the special effects are overdone, the writing is suitable, and I found most of the cast agreeable and entertaining.  I have found over the years that many of us tend to take our movies way too seriously. In the end, I could really care less that "Critters" doesn't follow the rules of reality. Because, when I pay to see movies like this, reality is something I want to escape from.+dvd
I agree with "Brodyman", a Gremlins wannabe.....+N+A very cheap quick ripoff of a commercial success of Gremlins. The kid below me is to stupid to know what good films are. Take the pacifier out of your mouth and change your diapers, Mommas boy+dvd
This documentary was a bit weak+P+9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government. If people do not believe me, go read and study that day like it was your babay and you'll find the truth. I was a bit skeptical at first as well. Now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in. This isn't the UNited States of America, this is the beginning of a NEw World Order. Don't believe me, we'll probably never know, because we'll be spoonfed our news on the war in Iraq by the Corporate Media that controls and censors what we see and DON'T SEE! Don't think so? You, along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in Iraq by watching CNN (Censored News Network), or Fauxnews. It pains me that people still don't realize that there is no fight for democracy in Iraq. Its a fight for Imperial Ambitions, we need Iraq for Oil, and to set up a puppet government so it doesn't scare Israel, our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of "radical muslim fundamentalists." No one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself, instead of relying on "experts" who "know" what is going on. I thought we were intelligent people, us Americans? Most of you can't even figure out wat the problem really is. Its our corrupt government+dvd
Complete waste of time!+N+The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a "Forrest Gump" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.   The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).   Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era.....+dvd
Well Worth the Wait+P+The conflicting reviews on this one made me stop and think, but I decided to purchase it anyway, and I am glad that I did.  For those who are puzzled or disappointed by the absence of Gibson guitars, Marshall amps, etc., I would recommend that they watch the interview segments on Disc 2, in which Bruce explains that they had originally tried the Gibson/Marshall setup, but that it simply did not work.  It would be well to consider that Cream had not played together for 37 years, so that it was rather like forming a new band; however, this set affirms that all the elements are still in place, and the band delivers solid performances throughout.  There are some persons who contend that Baker and Bruce were broke and desperate, and somehow convinced Clapton to play with them to bail them out.  However, in the interview segments, both Clapton and Baker confirm that it was Clapton's idea, with Baker stating that he "wasn't very keen on doing it" initially, until Clapton coaxed him into it.  Bruce looks terribly frail, and is seated during some parts of the show; however, his bass and vocal work are superb.  Clapton, who has aged well, shows that he has lost none of the fire and flair of the old days, and the 68-year-old Baker displays a level of skill and stamina rarely seen in drummers half his age.  While it is true that these performances are somewhat different from the originals, the updated renditions are amazingly good; after all, improvisation was always one of the factors which set Cream apart from other bands.  In an era when phony, hybrid versions of 60's-era bands seem to be everywhere, it is refreshing to see all the original members of one of the most influential bands of all time put aside their differences, re-form, and deliver quality performances of some of the greatest songs ever written.  Having viewed this set several times since buying it, I feel that it would have been a bargain at twice the price.  Thanks and kudos to Ginger, Jack, and Eric - long live the Cream+dvd
Deep and moving+P+Remains of the Day requires the viewer to be observant.  Anthony Hopkins takes on the challenge of playing a man who is emotionally repressed and self-effacing, a butler who has complete, blind faith in his master and thinks only to serve him.  Hopkins is such a gifted actor that he can slip into the role seamlessly while still suggesting - so long as you watch closely - private emotions in this restrained and stilted figure.  These emotions are often not fully understood by his character or dealt with properly, but Hopkins puts them there - they might be revealed in a gesture of the hand, a jaw unhinging slightly, eyes lingering more than is strictly necessary.  Hopkins is simply fascinating to watch.  He plays the butler Stevens, who in the years leading up to WWII serves Lord Darlington in a grand English country house.  Stevens is loyal to his master; he never questions him, never eavesdrops on his conversations, and assumes that his master has a great and complete understanding of the word.  Lord Darlington, however, turns out to be a Nazi appeaser; he wishes to play it safe and make a deal with Germany rather than go to war.  He holds a gathering of like-minded noblemen and high officials in his house, where only one American politician, Lewis (Christopher Reeve), contradicts him and his policies of appeasement.  When Darlington asks Stevens to remove two housemaids who are Jewish refugees, Stevens does so with some confusion but without argument.  After all, his master understands more than he.  He has to attend to the guests at the gathering, deal with his elderly father, an underbutler, who is growing too old for his duties, and handle the housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who has no problem contradicting Stevens and disturbing what little private time he sets aside each day for himself.  Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton with honesty, intelligence, and vitality.  The conversations between Kenton and Stevens often seem to be in some kind of code - on the surface they speak of housekeeping matters, or perhaps that sentimental book that Stevens reads in private and attempts to conceal...  but matters of greater urgency are touched upon.  Stevens is affected by Kenton, but seems immoveable as stone; he has sacrificed too much of himself to his service, and he is couched in duty and routine.  He can easily see if a single spoon is missing from the dinner table, but cannot put words to his emotions, such as they are.  Would it ever be possible for him to change? Just as Darlington's loyalties were grossly misplaced and repented too late, perhaps Stevens will also find himself only with regrets.  Remains of the Day is a fine, moving, nuanced picture, with rich performances.   +dvd
certain shade of green+P+this is a great dvd for any fan.  the middle of the show sometimes seems slow, but the 10+ minute version of vitamin is worth the price alone.  the extra cd that comes with the dvd is also good for anyone who doesnt have some of the songs in their collection already.  "Follow" is a great song and hopefully their new cd this summer will have more songs like it+dvd
Shaggy Dog+N+This movie was very disturbing to me,I did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in cages.The frog with the dog head bothered me.I don't  recommend this movie for small  children as they would take it too serious. There were some funny parts and Tim Allen played a very good role. I am an animal lover and I don't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie. Now I know why this movie never came to my local theatre+dvd
A Two-hour Unfunny Comedy+N+Don't get me wrong.  I love Bill Murray and I'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he's deserved.  But these Wes Anderson "comedies" are just lame.  RUSHMORE started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story (it felt like two-hours even if it wasn't).  And now THE LIFE AQUATIC.  All of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts.  I don't think there's been a good comedy since A FISH CALLED WANDA in 1988 (although parts of THE BIG LEBOWSKI are hilarious) so I don't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies.  Most stink.  Maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy.  That might explain the glowing reviews here.  Although Anderson's films are competently made, they feel stuffy and pretentious.  Humorless.  I chuckled once per hour.  Not a good average.  I don't think this movie ever makes up its mind.  And I'm so sick of Owen Wilson that I wish Hollywood would give him a paid vacation.  Does he have to be in every single movie ever made+dvd
I suppose...+P+that "Blackout" is being held for the season 5 release so all of the Johnny Depp die-hards will by it.  Nice marketing strategy.  21 Jumpstreet has always been one of my favorites+dvd
A fascinating dramatic series...+P+Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...  ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history...   The ER (Season 2) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere "Welcome Back, Carter!" in which Carter arrives late for his new position in the ER while Mark gets comfortable in his new position among the senior staff. Meanwhile, the ER tries to patch up the victims of a rival gang war, and new medical school students arrive in the ER for their rotations... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include "Hell and High Water" in which Doug happens upon a young boy trapped in a drain pipe rapidly filling with water, and "A Shift in the Night" in which Mark is forced to carry the load of the ER by himself when Doug is out with whiplash and Susan is out on business...  Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 2) DVD:  Episode 27 (Welcome Back, Carter!) Episode 28 (Summer Run)  Episode 29 (Do One, Teach One, Kill One)  Episode 30 (What Life?)  Episode 31 (And Baby Makes Two)  Episode 32 (Days Like This)  Episode 33 (Hell and High Water)  Episode 34 (The Secret Sharer)  Episode 35 (Home)  Episode 36 (A Miracle Happens Here)  Episode 37 (Dead of Winter)  Episode 38 (True Lies)  Episode 39 (It's Not Easy Being Greene)  Episode 40 (The Right Thing)  Episode 41 (Baby Shower)  Episode 42 (The Healers)  Episode 43 (The Match Game)  Episode 44 (A Shift in the Night)  Episode 45 (Fire in the Belly)  Episode 46 (Fevers of Unknown Origin)  Episode 47 (Take These Broken Wings)  Episode 48 (John Carter, M.D.)   The DVD Repor+dvd
I'm 3/4ths the DVD I used to be.... sing it, baby!+P+I've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments. Now, in retrospect, it all seems sadly obvious.  Just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs... and CHARGE THE SAME PRICE! [sound of metallic breathing] DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE!!!  On the positive side, I guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the "Complex" variety and thus considerably advance the Laughing Man storyline.  Don't get me wrong.  This is a great chapter of Stand Alone Complex, highlighted by a scene in which the Laughing Man pulls someone's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire. If there's a weak part of this installment, it's the sequence with the "Armored Suit", which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first GITS film, just as the "Testation" episode had done several installments back. The armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect. By the end of this installment, almost the entire shape and design of the Laughing Man plot seems clear.  It is interesting to learn from the special features that the Murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material+dvd
i never get tired of this one....+P+i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back.  it was on cable the other day.  it still keeps me glued to the set.  bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work.  too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience+dvd
Depp and Walken in real-time suspense+P+Johnny Depp's character is coerced into in assassination plot by a corrupt government agent played by Christopher Walken.  I like this movie. I think some of it is a little far fetched, but I like that it tries to tell the story in real time. It helps put you in the situation and adds to the suspense. And the situation is a tough one to get out of, with seemingly omniscient antagonists that deny his every attempt to free his captive daughter through means other than complying with their criminal demands. I think what appeals to me most is he's alone against the world and your right there with him. He's an ordinary guy put in an extroardinary situation, and the audience is taken along for the ride as he struggles to find a way+dvd
Not Another Teeny Bopper Movie+P+This movie surprised me.  I expected something like She's All That, one of the better teen movies (to me)...or maybe something less than that.  But this movie was not what I expected.  It was fresh and funny!  It made references to John Cougar Mellancamp and the storyline was unusual, absurb, and it worked.  Good comedy.  Not on my top ten list, but worth a viewing, in my book+dvd
Help+N+A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio.  The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out.  What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her...  This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game.  We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it.  We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon.  Thank you. Aussie Girls +dvd
Eh+N+Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity+dvd
The Devil Bores Read-a and Moviego-a+N+I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted. +dvd
Quite Possibly The Best PPV Ever Put On+P+When I heard that ECW was coming back full-blown and in its entirety I knew I had to review the best ECW show ever put on, and without a doubt one of the best PPV's put on under WWE's name  Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho - One of the best openers I have ever seen, these two just mesh so well, and that's mader completely obvious when you watch this the two dropkick spots are great but the ending makes you feel like you've been cheated 8/10  Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri - Excellent way to follow up the opener there are spots galore in this m atch with the top one obviously being Crazy's balcony moonsault this match has a lot of run-in's but that doesn't hurt it that much 7/10  Psicosis vs. Rey Mysterio - I'm kind of in the middle on this match, as its nowhere near as good as some of the stuff they have put on before it is still a solid bout with a great legdrop spot Rey picks it up with the help of the 619 (boo) 6/10  Sabu vs. Rhyno - This starts right after RVD's heart-felt promo, this was a little bit of a let-down although Sabu can't be expected to do everything anymore, kinda feels slow and dragged-on even though it is only 7 minutes and that's never good, great finish 5/10  Eddie Guerrerro vs. Chris Benoit - Technical masterpiece, with both men using great ring psychology, only complaint is that just when it kicks into high gear it ends but that's one complaint over one great match 8/10  Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - WOW, is the only word that comes to mind when viewing this match, that and OUCH, it is just a spot-fest but what a brilliant spot-fest it is where the action never lets up for a second, withouty a doubt MOTN 10/10  Dudleyz vs. Sandman & Tommy Dreamer - this had to be on the card, although it is not my cup of tea, it is still a very good match, the teaming of Sandy and Dreamer works like a charm and creates some funny moments 6/10  All this action is capped off by the trashing of Eric Bischoff, so I do not know how it could have gotten any better, great climax to a great nigh+dvd
No Soldiers, No War+P+This is a great movie that won Best Picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic. Oliver Stone directs his first movie about Vietnam (the second was "Born on the Fourth of July", another great movie) telling his own experience about going to war. From the very beginning we can see everything about the military that they don't show when they recruiting (the ugly and painful true about the war). And the movie goes on an on until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts, doing drugs, killing randomly, even killing each other. This is waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. The movie is obviously rated R for violence, and there are some very tough scenes that make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill -among others- a mentally retarded (and of course harmless) young guy, and a woman. Then they set the village on fire, rape some women, and get away with it. The whole cast is excellent, specially Dafoe, who in my opinion nails his character. And the DVD comes with an excellent and terrific documentary called "Tour of the Inferno" (about 30 minutes long) about the film with Stone, Dafoe, Depp, etc. talking about the movie. There is also a commentary by Stone and a captain in there. This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully. Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch. A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us. Everybody should ask themselves: war ... is it worth it? What for ... +dvd
Extremely Watchable+P+I had my doubts, but it turns out this film experience can't be denied.  It's formulaic, but also wiggy and raw and simply engrossing.  Damn funny as well.  The acting and dramatic elements are consistently strong, and there's no denying that Terrence Howard is an immensely talented and nuanced actor.   +dvd
Say What....?+N+....the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is....Reservior Dogs. This has great actors in it...I enjoyed seeing, f'instance, Dame Dunaway...but, she, Sinise, Dillon, Mantegna, and perpetual co-lister Faison had a poor dialog to work with. Imagine if QT had written it. Or, my favorite tough guy screenwriter, David Mamet. Fortunately though, Spacey will have something to build on develop a director's repertoire..+dvd
Worth it just for Mickey's Christmas Carol+P+I would gladly pay the same price for just Mickey's Christmas Carol on the dvd.  But, the other films are also special in their own right.  Good classic Disney stuff here+dvd
I wish I could give this movie a 6 rating, it's the best theatrical biography I have ever seen!+P+I loved everything about this movie.  It captured the spirit of Gandhi's life, had a well developed plot, great characters, beautiful scenery, wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama.  It didn't sensationalize Gandhi, his life, his impact on the world or rely on a lot of hollywood gimmicks for its strong visceral impact.  This is the best theatrical biography I have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time.  It is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably.  In short, it is a masterpiece+dvd
It sucks, badly+N+Really, the whole movie sucks.  Let's start from the top, the plot.  Now, as you probably know, the plot has nothing to do with the game, at all.  In fact, the only thing remotely close they have is the name, and the BFG.  The plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day, you know the drill.  Nothing horribly bad, except for it doesn't follow the game at all.  However, this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on Earth, and now Mars.  Really.  First, we have the Kid, who is horrible at everything, he talks while he's supposed to be stealthy, he gets high on mission, etc.  Yes, it's his mission, but I thought this was an elite military team, not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training.  And Portman, not only is a moron, but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he's saying.    Now, as for genres.  For a horror movie, it's not scary at all, not even a little suspense (though I kinda wanted the characters to die, so I guess that lost the suspense to me).  For an action movie, well, simply put, there's little to know action, until the very end.  And yes, there's a first person shooter sequence towards the end, but don;t be fooled, that is a gimmick and nothing more.    Without spoiling anything,I'm just gonna say that the ending is incredibly generic.  All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money. +dvd
LOTR+P+I loved these movies, and watched the extended versions but preferred to purchase these ones because, i didnt read the books, so its just the movies for me, i think the extended version and extras are for book fans. Its A little weird that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS doesnt have Spanish Subtitles but the other two did... i dont know why... but good collection, great story, good performances, amazing music, incredible scenes...+dvd
5 stars are not enough+P+OMG - This DVD is fantastic! Disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is. Lots of extras - some better than others. The time spent re-mastering everything was time well spent. The effort that went into this tour is mind boggling. A lot of times I just put it on and play it as background music - it even works as a 'Pink Floyd Greatest Hits' soundtrack.   Sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends (e.g. Les Claypool DVD) but everyone I have played this DVD for wants their own copy.  If you are a Pink Floyd fan - get it! You will not be disappointed.  +dvd
fake "Dog Whisperer" - studious ignorance+N+Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain+dvd
Meek Machine+N+From the people who brought you "50 First Dates" comes this synthetic remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds-Robert Aldrich crowdpleaser. Instead of a hard-edged prison population, we get caricatures and stereotypes. Adam Sandler is far more convincing as Happy Gilmore than Paul "The Wrecking" Crewe. Though a brilliant stand-up comedian, Chris Rock has yet to find his cinematic niche. The only bright spots are Reynolds (in the Michael Conrad role) and Courteney Cox+dvd
Don't waste your money+N+This workout (or should I call it that) is composed of pieces of all different workouts put together.  There is no class, no instructor, forget about cueing, no rhythm - it's horrible.  The abs part is even worse.  A kindergartener can do it.  5 day abs?  Yeah right.  I'm an advanced exerciser and this workout is a nightmare.  Trust me - DO NOT waste your money+dvd
PLEASE MAKE IT END!!!+N+There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this "movie" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more? The plot, the "humor," the dialogues, and the music are way beyond "below average." There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film! As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words... School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad...  Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk.  You have been warned!+dvd
Absolutely awful!+N+Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene "coming of age" wannabes.  It has been done much better in "Johns" and in Showtime's "Queer As Folk."   Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment.   Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief.  This movie has nothing to recommend it.  No stars is my rating.  But, thanks, Amazon, for finding me a buyer of my DVD copy through my Marketplace selling account+dvd
BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION!!!!!+P+Ghost Whisperer was the only show last season that I set aside time to watch each week.  I thoroughly enjoyed each episode and can't wait to own the first season. Andrea's death was so very sad.  I hope she'll be back for the occasional guest appearance, or should we say "ghost" appearance.  Looking forward to each and every episode of the new season+dvd
legendary story brilliantly told+P+the fable of Robin Hood is masterfully translated to the big screen. this 1938 version, of which there were myriad renditions, is deemed the absolute quintessential version. Errol Flynn is terrific as the outlaw Saxon. Olivia de Havilland delivers an equally stellar performance as the Lady Marian. filmed in georgeous early technicolor, this is a must for anyone's film library.  as for the DVD, the picture is flawless and absolutley gorgeous in technicolor and the sound is excellent too. get this one!!+dvd
Hard people to like.+N+The film has its amusing and even touching points, but not very many. The big problem with RH is that neither Ford or Benning are sympathetic characters. Henry is just the kind of self-important, ego-bloated, smug, arrogant, cold-blooded corporate ass that's helped step on working people for real, so it's really hard to feel anything for him, shot or not. He's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him, and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is, if you think about it, appalling. And his wife is, in a way, even worse; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides. She goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up, and doesn't become "normal" ntil much later. Only their daughter has any heart at all. Maybe a better ending would've been Henry's not making it, Bening going nuts from losing her stuff, and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should've been from day one. Barely watchable. +dvd
Kids just love animals+P+This video is a natural for a child.  My daughter loves to watch the animals and has learned to recognize a variety of creatures from this DVD alone.  I was thrilled to see they were limited to standard barnyard animals, and I love the upbeat music and the charming scenes!  It always holds my daughter's attention and is great for soothing her from a bad mood, and also for thrilling her when she is already happy+dvd
Amazon.com likes to take my money+N+this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave+dvd
I didn't like it...+N+For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.  This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.   Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.   Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).   I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.  The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.   Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.   Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?)+dvd
What a Letdown!+N+I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better+dvd
A movie they would never make today!+P+This is a great film. But, sadly, it would never be made today. I mean, try to imagine a film in which a 15 or 16 year of character has an abortion and it is taken as just another plot point. (Compare this to Crowe's Singles which brought back the oh so convienent miscarriage, like something out of a 1940's movie.) Also, imagine a film begin made today which invests so much time in developing its characters. Yep, you can't. So enjoy it for what it is, a window on a lost world.+dvd
Cheap Sopranos rip off falls way short+N+I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.  It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.  The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.  Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.  This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.    Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.    +dvd
Surrealistically Bizzare+P+Though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody (Dawn of the Dead, An American Werewolf in London are examples), the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative. Just like Re-Animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre, Evil Dead 2 takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer/Scary Movie cash cows. For those who liked the "tree" sequence in the first Evil Dead movie, imagine it being magnified over and over again. Using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion, Evil Dead 2 is still wildly imaginative.  A person tries to fight off their own severed hand. Visions appear from nowhere. The first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving. If you don't like slasher films (believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any Friday the 13th film, take your pick) or if you're one of those old blue haired types ranting about "video nasties" then stay away. However, if you want a good, gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then Evil Dead 2 is for you. For real film fanatics, one might note (though on a far more intellectual level)the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist(s) of the film can also be found (albeit much more arty and far less gorey) in the films of Jan Svankmeyer. As for the casual horror buff, Evil Dead II is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with Rob Zombie's "The Devil's Rejects". Leave the lights on+dvd
FANDANGO?+P+This DVD had me in tears laughing! This is a hill-air-ee-us program!! If your a fan of subversive humor, you will not be able to stop watching this!!! Cant wait for season 3+dvd
seven decisions to a sucessful life+P+This the best life altering experience I have ever had.  To not buy this would be a severe mistake.  Buy it, listen to it, change your life forever+dvd
The worst subtitles awards goes to...+N+I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd.  This is a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd.   Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class.  The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit.  Alas, I was not; this was for real.  Such a shame+dvd
Entertaining and Smart+P+"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a remake of an older film I've never seen and stars the former James Bond, Pierce Brosnan as the title character. This is the perfect role for Brosnan, because he's better suited as a smart and sophisticated millionaire than an action hero. The movie is smart, plausible, entertaining, and the performances are very suave. As I said, Brosnan plays Thomas Crown; a millionaire who's life really isn't very fun...So, Crown decides to steal a painting from a museum that's worth 100 Million dollars. Crown, however, is not stealing the painting for what it's worth but merely for the excitement of doing it. The actual theft of the painting is really entertaining and pretty damned plausible. After he steals the painting, the cops begin investigating as well as an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), who's willing to do anything to find this painting. One thing Crown longs for (as it's explained in his therapy sessions) is a female equal to himself and Catherine has enough determination and smarts to fill that. Well, eventually Crown and Catherine begin an affair (and I must say, that for a woman in her forties Russo looks incredible) that appears to be only about sex. Neither one of them are entirely sure if they can trust one another. Comedian Denis Leary ('Rescue Me' & 'Jesus' Son') plays Michael, a detective working on the case along with Catherine. But, Brosnan and Russo really light up the screen. They play the characters better than anybody I could think of and they actually have charisma on screen, which makes it all the more better. This movie isn't a masterpiece but it is entertaining and exciting and worth watching.  GRADE: A-+dvd
Wonderful+P+I absolutely love this movie. Hanks and Ryan have so much chemistry together and the story is so adorable. I have watched this movie so many times and love it more every time!+dvd
This Star Does Not Shine+N+So-So story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother.  Like that old Dickie Roberts movie, it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars, but does not do a good job of it.  Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, where are you when we need you?   +dvd
One Last Dance+N+I am sorry but I was unable to watch this product as it is not for Australian viewing which I did not realise or understand at the time.  I have received a full refund for these goods but I would have rather been able to watch them.  Thank you for your help and I wish I could have done your review - Iren+dvd
Bridget!+P+I love this movie. Bridget has a way of embarrassing me and I am not even there with her! If you are a fan of "Pride and Prejudice" you will love this updated virgin on it. I laugh, I cried, and I am so happy I bought this DVD. The Special Features are true to fashion and can be more funny the the film. Well done, Brid! Well Done+dvd
BALKAN BULLCRAP+N+Let's be up straight and honest.  There is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie.  Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series.  Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga.  Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!!+dvd
What relationships and romance ought to be...+P+This version of Jane Austen's Persuasion is an excellent example of the subtlety and warmth that is missing from modern, so-called romances. Anne and Wentworth are the two sane people surrounded by a range of wacky characters trying to distract them from what's really important. My husband and I are big fans of Jane Austen and this movie is one of our favorites, second only to the A&E five-hour version of Pride and Prejudice+dvd
rating of this movie+N+This movie was not Bill Murray's  best. I would not recommend it to anyone+dvd
True story+P+Its kind of hard to base your opinion on this movie because its real life, there are a whole lot of kids in the world exactly like this, so if you like to see the life of kids in the real world i would watch this movie. Of course not every kid acts like tha+dvd
Sheer fun+P+This is just a delight.  There is sadness, but it is handled beautifully and believably.  The voices are so well suited to the animation.  On the second disk do not miss "Sid on Sid" that is hilarious. There is plenty of ice age information for those who are interested, for the rest of us this is just fu+dvd
What?+N+I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys.  Real life isn't like that.  I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up.  But this is the worst movie I have ever seen. +dvd
I'll be there... but not for long+N+There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut "I'll Be There" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.  Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.  The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.  "I'll Be There" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because "I'll Be There" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.  With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills.   The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.  Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. "I'll Be There," but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can+dvd
watch you talking about willis?+N+The story of the Strokes is the story of wealth and privilege, and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like Lou Reed and VU riffs.  This was made without RCA, and so lacks strokes music.    The band apparently wanted nothing to do with it, it is practically DIY, with no interviews.  This just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project.  Their 2nd album sucked anyway+dvd
Well done!+P+Perhaps it was too long ago for anyone to have memories that could correct innaccuracies but few movies of the first world war seem to get it right.   This one captures the American experience in that war like few others have.   Drama and action together bring out a story of depth, courage, tolerance, and forbearance in the crucible of adversity. I watch it again and again.  Hard to believe it was made for TV and not a major picture.  Still one of the great war-stories to capture the American public.   +dvd
Typical Wackness+N+how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess.  the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts  of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts.  the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well.+dvd
Good Package+P+Has all the Harry potters with their respective added materials, much cheaper than buying individually. +dvd
Another Gay HIV+ Demon Infects Another Innocent Wife (YAWN)+N+Intensely homophobic, heterosexist, and hateful, this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the 1980s. It was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men, blaming antisocial "AIDS carriers" for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies. It was a time when the public blamed AIDS on lust-driven, irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands. The film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of HIV. It reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with HIV can be neatly separated into the categories of "deserving" or "undeserving" - immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row. Twenty years ago, perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic. We did not know then that HIV was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic. Today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about HIV and HIV+ people. Most importantly, HIV is no longer a death sentence to Americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early. As someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for HIV infection every year, I would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment+dvd
(2.5 Stars) His Best in Years But Still Needs Something More+N+The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents.  Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years.  But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life.  Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China.  And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2').  And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room.  [TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently.  'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases.  Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos.  These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.'  So how good is this film?  It depends on your expectaions.  'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious.  My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.'  But it's just my idea.  The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed.  The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing.  (Case in point.  You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.)  But  most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall.  I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story.  Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director.  (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb   says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!)  As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America.  Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back.  I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.'  'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.         +dvd
did they misbehave?+P+loved this movie~ rather refreshing to see 4 filmakers work on one film using tim roth as the bellhop who was just fabulous~ chapter 3 certainly threw me off guard :) its a keeper in the collection dark humor comedy+dvd
Love it; Great beginner yoga DVD+P+When I decided to try yoga this was the first DVD that I purchased.  It is fantastic.  I have since bought another 3 of Ravi & Ana's DVDs, and several done by other people.  The other choices do not come anywhere near the standard and style of Ravi & Ana.  Thank you to them for making my discovery of yoga a true pleasure+dvd
Best one so far+P+So far this is the best of the Ana Brett and Ravi Singh DVDs that we tried.  Best production quality+dvd
Not good...+N+Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..+dvd
One of John Wayne's Best Performances+P+This post-war made film (1951) about WWII is rather retrospective and honest in its telling of the tale. Wayne is very good here in an uncomplicated role. Mixing, submarines, lurking enemy, and old flings or ex-flings with a lot of macho dialogue (without preaching) along the way, this film does not fail to entertain. George Waggner's direction give a lot of freedom to get his story across.  +dvd
When things go wrong and one is in harm's way.+P+This is a chilly saga of an American sub captain plagued by failure-prone weapons and an ocean full of Japanese to fight.  They find the reason the torpedoes didn't work and put back to sea, this time, to take good care of the nasty business at hand. One scene that brings the cost of war home is that the Thunderfish loaned another sub a movie, &quot;Washington Slept Here.&quot;  Sometime later, they find wreckage of an American sub, and the movie tells them who is at the bottom of the ocean. The Thunderfish strikes back at the sub that got their friends, showing how dangerous it was out there and what courage it took to fight this war. The climax scene shows them in a Japanese-controlled harbor, with a waiting task force.  They fire their new and deadly torpedoes, and radio back to Cincpac about the taskforce and its location.  They run for cover, and barely survive massive retaliation: the outcome is in doubt until the last, as it was for many other submariners. A moving, poignant, and bittersweet tale that stresses the fact that nothing ever comes for free, even in war+dvd
The Shopping Mall is filled with flesh-eating zombies.+P+With the success of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), a must-see for every horror movie buff, George A. Romero, 11 years later, in 1979, made a sequel, DAWN OF THE DEAD (1979) in living color (and dead too).  This time, he could really be bloody and gruesome.   Francine (Gaylen Ross), and three military men Peter (Ken Foree), Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Stephen (David Emge) go to the Oxford Development Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania to kill hundreds of living dead zombies.  Even zombies like J.C. Penny's.   This movie was written, directed and edited by George A. Romero. He also appears in the technical booth with a scarf around him.   All 130 stores cooperated for the filming.   Tom Savini is "Pasquale Buba".  He is also credited for make-up, cosmetic special effects and stuntman.  He also appears in From Dusk 'Til Dawn (1996) and the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004).   Shown in widescreen.  Many extras. Audio commentary with George A. Romero and his wife Chris and Tom Savini.   Best Line: "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth".  said by Ken Foree (as "Peter").  Easter Egg #1:  Click "Audio Set up", Push down to play. Push right button to resume to main menu and to...you made the zombie turn black.  Press "Enter". Tom savini discusses practical jokes.  Easter Egg #2: Click "Extras". Push right button or down button 8 times until zombie turns black. Chris Romero discusses how she met her future husband, George A. Romero.  Followed by DAY OF THE DEAD (1985)             LAND OF THE DEAD (2005)             DIARY OF THE DEAD (2007)  In 1990, George Romero returned to make his classic film with a new cast and in living color, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990), directed by Tom Savini, starring Tony Todd.   In 2004, Director Zack Snyder came out with a remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004).   So in 2005, Romero himself made a new sequel, LAND OF THE DEAD (2005).   Director Steve Miner will do a remake of DAY OF THE DEAD (1985). It is set for release in 2007.   George A. Romero wrote and will direct a new sequel, "DIARY OF THE DEAD" to also be released in 2007. +dvd
One of the worst movies I have ever seen.+N+This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end.  I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted+dvd
An Absolutely Gorgeous Movie+P+Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers+dvd
Charming and filled with fun and laughter+P+In a world filled with headlines on war and hate, you and your family will enjoy these timeless classics that enthralls people of all ages (including men!). The beautiful poetic Anne captures our imagination and we can see a piece of ourselves in her with every step through her life journeys. Use these beautifully inspiring books to bring your family closer together and grab the attention of your children inspiring them to read other literature. This is a must read for anyone of any age!+dvd
The Best in the Breed+P+When is comes to teacher/student dramas there isn't one better than 'Mr. Holland's Opus' for the main reason that it's believable.  Most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers, teachers that can do no wrong.  Here, we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome isn't always the best.  He's a man who knows how to do one thing, and that one thing he does so well, but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one's he loves the most.  Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss in a career best) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills.  His wife (Glenne Headley) is supportive, yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change.  Their relationship is tried as Glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who can't share his love of music is killing him.  Glenn is a very flawed man, but he has a very big heart and that's why this film works so well.  When Glenn starts to fall in love with a student you don't hate him as much as you feel bad for him.  He's far from a bad man, he's just a man.  This is truly one of the most touching, inspirational and blessed movies I've ever seen.  It's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time I watch it.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast and a very true to life feel to the script and to the performances you feel as though you know these people, and by the end of the film you'll want to.  As ispirational as 2001's 'A Beautiful Mind' this film stands tall as one of the best films ever made+dvd
A great addition to any workout+P+Both volumes provide a great addition to any cardio workout. What I like the most is it that you can choose which part of your body you want to focus on and go right to that section. It provides three approaches to each movement, easy, regular,and challening. These CD's should last several years at least. A great buy!+dvd
The Long Long Trailer+P+The service related to this purchase was very good.  I had no issues in regards to the delivery and the quality is acceptabl+dvd
"Is this funny still?  Yet?  I honestly can't tell..."+N+Seasons One, Two, Three:  "Go Man, Go!"  Season Four: the one to forego.  Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning ("People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things."), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare "Mister Mr. Show" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find "Season Four" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package.    Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life,  says that Four was the season when "well-crafted" sketches were "in", "absurdity for absurdity's sake" was "out".  No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers.  Translation:  they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner).   Enticing as the term is, "well-crafted" here seems to mean "warmed over SNL type stuff", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is "funny" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl.   Overall, MS4's concepts  become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy.  I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior?  (ex-cel-si-or   (n.)   Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)).     This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours.  One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of "Monster Parties" (as documented in novelty songs such as "Halloween Shindig", "Dracula's Pajama Party" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar.  Original, bent premise anchored by yet another  simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance.  For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny.  Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass. +dvd
Blinds are like regulars, now.+P+THIS IS THE ONE! The other DVD collections for seasons 1, 2 & 3 were pretty funny (OK...some of the funniest stuff of all time, especially "Druggachusetts," and "The Chip on the Shoulder Club") but THE FOURTH SEASON WAS WHEN IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. It doesn't get any better than the episode called "Show Me Your Weenis!"  The first time I saw this, in 1998 when it first aired, I realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent, over-the-top American comedy.  Surreal, sharp, better than any British zaniness, and full of bizarre ideas like "furniture for the blind" that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices; and the all-time greatest, "Wyckyd Scepter," which must be seen to be believed.  Bob and Dave, you are SO naked! Better than Monty Python ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SO-CALLED "COMEDY" SERIES I CAN THINK OF.  IF YOU GET ONLY ONE OF THE MR. SHOW DVD SETS, GET THIS ONE.  +dvd
Awfully...*yawn*+N+(Yup...it's that DC hating teen on her dad's account)  Although GG is possibly one my favorite television series, I was disappointed with this one.   Possibly NO character development, except maybe Lorelai.   Jared Padalecki's annoyingly routine guest spots as married/in-denial/sleazball chump cheater Dean Forrester gets on my last nerve. I could smack Rory for sleeping with him, and ruining his fated marriage.  Meanwhile, Lorelai becomes almost ditzy. Her relationship with Jason Stiles gets quite boring. She's totally oblivious to Luke's obvious infatuation with her.   Emily and Richard's seperation is the best part...watching them bicker is funny.  The end kiss with Luke/Lorelai is the best part.  Otherwise...don't get it+dvd
One Amazing Night+P+I was very fortunate to have been a volunteer at the Musicares Person of the Year Tribute to James Taylor on February 6, 2006. It was a spectacular evening filled with great music and a wonderful feeling. I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I am very much looking forward to it. If you're a fan, this is a must have. Stars performed James' music and talked about what his music and life's work has meant to each of them. I loved Sting's sweet and funny story about evaluating his own musical career prospects after seeing James play for the first time.  Performers and set list included:  Sweet Baby James - Paul Simon Shower the People - Dixie Chicks Secret of Life - India.Arie You Can Close Your Eyes - Sting Everybody Gets the Blues - Taj Mahal and Dr. John Country Road - Keith Urban  Millworker - Bruce Springsteen You've got a Friend - Carole King (and James) Copperline, Shed a Little Light, Fire and Rain - James  Sheryl Crow and Bonnie Raitt also performed, but I can't quite recall what.  I'm sure you'll also get to see James interacting with his wife Caroline and two small sons who were there. They seem like a nice family. I had the chance to talk to them briefly and James is as kind and caring as you would imagine him to be.  I loved this special evening and am grateful to have played a small part in it.   +dvd
Gave me a new perspective on things as they are+P+This was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all.  It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.  If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish.  Thank you Mr. Gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen+dvd
tyler perry goes to jail+P+tyler perry is just plan funny. i have all his tapes now. this is not as good as diary of a mad black women, but is still definely worth seeing. my whole family loves them and watches them over and over. they medias family reunion is very funny. i will continue to collection all the tapes he puts out!! and the fact that he is a christian is even better. great comedy, and that is usually not my choice of dvd, but this is great humor. c+dvd
As Good as Season One--With More Twists--No Spoilers in This Review+P+My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV.  After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it.  However, it did not disappoint.  It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets.  Season Two finds the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'The Others'.  There are additional characters.  I won't say where they come from, but be prepared for a shock.  Each LOST character carries personal baggage, has what might be called a tragic flaw, and in Season  Two, these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some.  Also, some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad.  The writing and acting are outstanding.  It never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on LOST is not spoken.  The characters give 80% of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking, or their body language, even such little things as a raised eyebrow.  This minimalist dialog requires great acting, and the LOST cast is one of the best.  They certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers.  There are more twists and turns on Season Two than Season One, which had to spend more time on character development.  Be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from Season One in more detail, or from the angle of another person, and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes--some where you think the character is dreaming, but isn't, and some where you think the characters are acting, but are dreaming.  Great color, sound, location, scripting, acting, suspense.  Highly recommended.  Five stars+dvd
Garbage for all seasons!!+N+This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile+dvd
The War is Over but the Battle Lives On (WWE vs TNA)!+P+The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews.  I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD.  They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW.  I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info.  Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection.  I just wish they added more matches and interviews.  TNA better watch themselves.   +dvd
Family Dissolution, Lust for Power, Madness ...+P+The story line is superb ... the scenery is stunning and gorgeous, vast mountains and green valleys, walled castles and fortresses. Hidetora, the aging warlord, holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside. He announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons. Only one son, the youngest, dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting, he predicts the same after the transfer of power. He believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy. The youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord. Hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons. He has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half, which they easily do. He gives them in succession, three arrows bundled together, representing the unity of the family, none can break the bundle. This is Hidetora's example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified. He envisions the House of Ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during Hidetora's own reign of power. In his anger, Hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes ... Yet Subarua, the youngest, holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass.  Hidetora visits Taro's castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to Taro's wife, Sue'. They are forced to move out. Hidetora discovers after the transfer of power, he is no longer respected. Sue' married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war, a war in which her parents were murdered. She harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother, Jiro. Hidetora's court jester creates a mocking song about Taro being like a gourd, spinning this way and spinning that way, implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it. At a family gathering Taro hears the song and is outraged ... In a surprise move, Hidetora and his guards leave to visit Jiro. Hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either, not at all what he expected. He left abruptly ...  The treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them. As predicted by Subaru, the younger brother, war is inevitable. Local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie, which brother to support. Hidetora goes into hiding. Eventually he goes mad. His only guard and caregiver, the jester, does not leave his side. This film contains very strong battle scenes. The desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers. Loosely based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this Japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur. The costumes and scenery are fabulous. In the film, there are tender moments between the jester and Hidetora. There are moving scenes where Jiro's wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage ... The producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion. At some point, Hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled.  The ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer. The film is amazing! Erika Borsos (erikab93+dvd
Bad Quality DVD+N+The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that's what you'll get when you buy this.  I say this because I've used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD:  Skin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up.  Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall's uniform (you'll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue.  Then look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green.  Evidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish.  As he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they're filled with blue.  At 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It's purple. That is not black.  On top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall's eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black.  I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release.  I plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, "proper" quality.  'Nuff said+dvd
Definitive portrayal of generation X (for what that's worth)+N+Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.   +dvd
Brilliant Actings, Predictable Story!+N+I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy+dvd
I wish I could have seen it!+N+I was unable to view my DVD of Ballet Russes since the message on the screen said - not available in this area - or something like that. I have sent 3 Emails to Amazon to tell them I was unable to view it, and despite the fact they promise replies to Emails within 24 hours, I have heard nothing. So I am not happy at all. I will let you know how good the DVD is when you send me a copy I can view+dvd
Phenomenal! The best intro to Tai Chi and 'Internal Arts'+P+"A fantastic four-hour DVD full of exercises, Qigong, meditation, and a short Yang style Tai Chi sequence done to the left and the right. It has simple to follow along to 20 minute, 40 minute or 60 minute Workouts, and a long, brilliant Instructional section with very detailed guidance through every movement, from basic to advanced.  I followed along to the 20 minute version sitting down at first, and have worked up to the 40 minute standing. This program helps you to regain strength and overall health."  A Viewe+dvd
One of the best!!+P+I love this movie.  For those who love romance, fantasy, knighthood, gallantry, and all that, this is your thing.  One reason I love it is that Don Quixote must have read (!) the saying, "When you tell a man he is brave, you are helping him to become so."  The Don, this mad-man, sees nothing but the beautiful and pure in the whore Aldonza, and despite her violent rejection of his view of her and the name "Dulcinea" that he gives her, she eventually realizes HIS purity of mind and begins to think maybe there is something worthwhile in her after all.  Thus, she becomes, slowly, as he envisions her.  That to me is thrilling.  And, I heartily disagree with those reviewers who object to the voices of Peter O'Toole (dubbed) and Sophia Loren.  Sure, they aren't the best, but taking the Don's for instance;  if his voice had been any better, it would have been 'way out of character for the "Knight of the Woeful Countenance."  And a Shirley Jones voice would not have been convincing for the whore Aldonza, to my way of thinking.  To me, they were both perfect for their parts.  Cummon, let's be realistic!  If you want perfect voices, watch "Carousel" etc.  This movie is inspirational, touching, exciting, and one I watch many times, getting a thrill out of it each time.  Am ordering the DVD with captions, as I don't want to miss ONE word!+dvd
DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO BREAKDANCE!!!+N+You Got Served was a horrible misrepresentation of what the b-boy scene is actually like and this instructional video pushes that misrepresentation even further. If you want to learn to breakdance buy the Breakdance step-by-step dvd released by bboy.org or any of the films in the Breakvision series+dvd
Kind of loses steam very quickly+N+Even though it's used by a lot of reviewers, I have to use it too. The opening scene has John Travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how Hollywood creates **** lately. He mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end, then later in the film he talks about Harry Houdini and misdirection. Oddly, this film was produced by Joel Silver, who I can list as a creator, or at least a deliverer, of said Hollywood ****. There's only 3 reasons really to watch this film, none of which have anything to do with the story, which shows you just how the film is.  Stan is a talented hacker who's been down on his luck since being released from jail. Dead end job, unkempt trailer and denied rights to see his daughter. Well, an opportunity comes when a woman, Ginger, offers him money to meet with a man. That man, Gabriel, is incredibly wealthy and will pay him 10 million dollars to create a computer virus that'll net him near 10 billion dollars. Of course, it doesn't help that the feds are after both of them  Those 3 reasons? Well, the first is an incredibly awesome looking shot where we get a 180 slow motion pan (it is NOT a full 360) after an explosion goes off and we see it's aftermath. While the full version of the X-Men Last Stand shot found in the special features looks better, this is just as great. The other is at the end where a helicopter flies a bus all over the city and smacking into buildings while the 3rd is of course a nude sunbathing Halle Berry which apparently she was paid a handsome sum of money for each breast shown. However, that's kind of where the good parts end.  The biggest problem is that it's an action movie based on the lowest common denominator. It's super-stylized and sleek and has some pretty big sequences but that's it. Some action films like Die Hard inexplicably hold up on repeated viewings. Here, after the first watch, you've probably experienced all you're going to see. They add in the daughter subplot which isn't as developed as it should be but it did resonate with me. The film does have its fan but it's hard for me to like something so....plastic.  Should you buy it? I doubt it, unless you want a show-off disc for your home theatre, something that other films do infinitely better+dvd
An observation of the taboo... with depth.+P+Let's be honest. Sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives, yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly. This movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way. Whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not, this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about, and it does it in a way that is quite frankly, non-sensational and non-gratuitous. And you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get' and enjoy this movie, for it goes much deeper. This is a excellent character study.  The film is quite erotic, although very little actual sex is shown. It's power is in the anticipation and what is NOT said. It's about NEED. As several other reviewers have brought out here, there's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex. The beauty of the film is in it's subtlety and the depth of the characters, which the director takes time to develop.  Both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story, which really is a story about 'complements'. It's about finding that balance in the energy between two people. There is a silent, powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles. The viewer can really just 'sense' this dynamic building throughout the film.  There is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes. There is so much that is unspoken, yet if you pay attention, you know what is going on. I think it's great film-making. In an age when we are innundated with quick, flash images every other second, sensational sex and violence for it's own sake, and a total LACK of character development, I find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters, and Secretary does that superbly.  I also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental, open honesty. After all, in the end, its a LOVE story. A story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation. And really, isn't that what any successful relationship is really about? The look in Lee's face in the last frame of the movie says it all.+dvd
Ferris Bueller's Day off +P+Perfect movie for everyone. No matter how many times I watch the movie it is always funny. Whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good. +dvd
Fade To Black...+P+Karen Black (Burnt Offerings) burned herself into my memory w/ this 1975 TV anthology! For 30 years I remembered the Zuni fetish doll in the AMELIA segment, unable to recall much about the first two stories. Well, I just watched TOT again tonight, and I liked all three tales. While AMELIA is still my favorite, I found both JULIE and MILLICENT AND THERESE to be creepy and fun. Karen Black is a chameleon, changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress, then terrified victim, and finally into savage huntress, all in under 80 minutes! Dan Curtis (Night Stalker, Night Strangler) allows Ms. Black to  show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable, while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed! This is one of those rare TV horror masterpieces that the 70s churned out. Like DUEL, NIGHT STALKER, THE DEAD DON'T DIE, etc., TRILOGY OF TERROR made it's mark. I'm glad to see it back on DVD...   +dvd

Princess Mononoke+P+I have seen Princess Mononoke on T.V., and it rocks! It's just awesome like all the other movies that japanese guy makes+dvd
a true love brings maturity+P+Beautiful. When the movie begins, the young lead character is a selfish, self-absorbed, lazy young man. He is looking for the quickest way to make money with the least effort...and like many of his peers, has an intense dislike for the refugee father and "son" who come to work with the company he is employed with. I mean, this fellow is just awful. He's so obnoxious, you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he'd fall off of the building.  And then he does. He finds out, by accident, that the "son" is really a young woman. And he is immediately drawn to her. Suddenly, instead of being the tormentor he is the protector, of her physically and of her secret.  When events transpire that lead him to search for her(well, I can't give EVERYTHING away, now can I?), we get to see the maturation process in action. Caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family.  Iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call "happy endings". Those are rare and not sought after. But there are endings that aren't horrid, just sort of sad, in a good way. It's hard to explain, but this film supplies an excellent example. In Iran, princes don't rescue the princesses, they usually get mangled by the dragon, but it's never a dull ride(and in this case he doesn't actually get mangled...).+dvd
Did I miss something here?+N+I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide".  I saw the 1974 production twice.   My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once.     This DVD should have been an excellent performance.  Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible.   Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image.  I assumed it was a really bad recording job.   Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy?+dvd
What a horrible Butcher Job of a Masterpiece!!!!!+N+So there I was......browsing through Amazon.com and on "the page I made" up pops, guess what? Triumph of the Nerds on DVD. Seeing this, I was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when BAM! I read one of the reviews......   Still a great show, but the Ambrose edition is not complete!, October 28, 2004   Reviewer:    Sean Breazeal (Mt. Pleasant, UT USA)  I immediately checked with Bob, and Yes, sure enough, several minutes had been cut from the original US release for "space" requirements. In his defense, Bob had no input on this. Were it me? I'd be hopping mad.  Instead of the publisher, Ambrose, using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes, extended version, and extras, they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing.  Bob Cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does. Had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what I'm sure was hours of extra content Bob had to cut, I'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it. Having purchased 3 copies of the boxed video set (1 lost to a fire, 1 lost to a non-returning friend) there would have been NO hesitation to this. In fact, I'd have watched it straight through on receipt.  What a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake Ambrose has made. FIX IT!!!!  Don't walk, RUN from this edition. I know it's Old school, but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version. You'll thank me later+dvd
The darker side of comedy+P+BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types.  And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive.  The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue.  One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male.  The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing.  A lovely film full of surprises+dvd
Can We Be Proud That We Are American's For Once+N+The film Why We Fight, I believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize America. I felt that the movie, only told one side of the argument, and that side was clearly not pro-America. The film portrays the United States as a power hungry nation, which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world. The film constantly criticizes the decisions of America leaders to engage into foreign combat. The film however, does not present an alternative solution. It fails to take into consideration that America may be acting out of self defense. The film constantly criticizes America for engaging in combat throughout the world. What I have to say to the director of this film is: Is it not alright to defend your nation, after terrorist drive planes into two buildings, killing 3,000 people? Is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots, who are looking to destroy your way of life? Is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the Middle East, by toppling a murderous dictator? When I see these questions, I have to answer no to all of them. I feel that if America feels threatened, it should not have to seek permission to defend itself. President Bush put it properly I feel when he stated "After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers," and "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." This film can criticize America and label it as a bully nation, but these terrorist must be brought to justice. President Eisenhower once said, "Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin." As the most powerful nation in the world, it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world. It is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as Americans, sometimes take for granted. Since when, has it become wrong to defend your nation. Why must America be criticized for engaging in conflict, when it feels threatened? Is it not the job of the President of the United States to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent? Does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack America again, if they are given the chance? We can never let our guard down. Freedom does not come free. On September 11, 2001 we saw firsthand how evil, those who want to destroy us can be. You can not negotiate with these types of people. The only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force. On the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks, President Bush stated that "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended." Indeed freedom was and is being defended, and I see nothing wrong with that. Words are not enough to protect our nation. President Theodore Roosevelt said, "Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind," and our great action, will be to defend this great nation. In the words of President Hoover, "Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity," and it is America's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. Remember: "Words without actions are the assassins of idealism." Herbert Hoove+dvd
Hard to keep up with+N+I would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people.  The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often.  It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult.  I couldn't imagine how kids could.  The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync.  I would recommend "Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun+dvd
Had to Turn It Off+N+I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved "The RM".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it+dvd
Great chick flick+P+This was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I decided to buy it for a girls night out. It went over very well.  I even watched it with my husband, who found it very entertaining. Extra features on the DVD are interesting, but don't add a whole lot to the film itself+dvd
Heartbreaking+P+I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen+dvd
Great DVD for aspiring cheerleaders.+P+I am a former cheerleader and cheerleading coach and really enjoy this DVD.  I bought it for my young daughter and loaned it out to some of my cheerleaders when coaching.  It teaches the basics:  the motions and what they're called, some cheers and chants, and one really fun dance routine.  It also goes a little bit into what it means to be a cheerleader for your school and what will be expected of you and the code of conduct that you'll be expected to follow.  It does NOT go into jumps or stunting at all.  The stunting is definitely something cheerleaders don't want to learn from a DVD, but I was disappointed that they didn't teach any jumps.  Another reviewer somewhere else, a former cheerleader, gave this DVD low marks because she expected to get a good workout from it and relive the good-old-days.  Let me just point out to everyone, this is an instructional DVD for beginners.  It's not a workout DVD and it's not for cheerleaders that already have a lot of cheer experience.  Also, the organization that put this DVD together is the UCA, one of the biggest cheer-instruction organizations out there.  They've been conducting cheer clinics all over the country for many years.  Other cheer organizations do some motions differently or have different names for them.  There is no right or wrong way, but aspiring cheerleaders should know this in case they make it on a squad coached by someone trained by one of the other groups.  Always follow your coach's instructions and don't challenge him or her with these differences.  One more word of advice for aspiring cheerleaders:  unless you live in a very rural, small town with a small student population and are sure there won't be much competition at try-outs, TAKE GYMNASTIC CLASSES.  Cheerleading has become very athletic and competitive.  To increase your chances in the more populated areas, you will need tumbling skills.  Dance classes - especially hip-hop - wouldn't hurt either.  Yoga - to increase balance and flexability - would help a lot, too.    Good luck+dvd
An Interesting Misfire+N+Lord knows the media is a worthy target for social commentary. However, it is also an easy one, and has been often targeted in the past. Thus the central problem with "Mad City," Costa-Gavras' updating of Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole." The film spends nearly two hours denouncing the media---namely print and television news---for a variety of social ills, for not all of which it can so easily be blamed. And those things it can be blamed for, we kind of already knew.  Nonetheless, an excellent cast works hard to bring off this story of reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman), who `lucks into' an exclusive when a disgruntled, laid-off security guard (John Travolta) takes his former employer and a group of kids hostage in a museum while Brackett just happens to be in the bathroom. Travolta is to be commended for taking on a part that is not particularly sympathetic, in the form of a character that is not very bright. He and Hoffman carry the film as far as it can go, but by the end you are likely to feel that you're being hit over the head with the simplistic central message, such that the tragic coda loses impact. It's not a bad film, and with these talents it can't help but have its moments, but overall it's a bit of a missed shot+dvd
fun for me - not for others?+P+This movie was made for anyone who ever went to summer camp. It takes all the ridiculous things that happen and exaggerate them about 6842673 times.  I personally enjoyed it thoroughly, but for those of you who DON'T spend 6 weeks out of your summer at camp, it might not be as appealing+dvd
review of a very funny video+P+I had seen this video some while past and was looking to let a fried enjoy this humor,the video is super funny and quite well directed for such a different type of entertainment,this is a must see for all of billy bob lovers,get lost in the country for a couple of hours.  This movie will entertain all Medical Marijuana advacates as well as show the value of the statement [legalize and tax it ] hope you like it as much as myself and a few chosen friends at a gathering of like minded peopl+dvd
National  Treasure+P+This is a very enteraining movie and really enjoyed all of the intrigue that it had and the good ending+dvd
Well Made Movie+P+I first watched Friday on VH1 and on Comedy Central, both however were edited, the DVD allowed me to see more of the Movie, I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie+dvd
Disappointed- +N+I bought this video for my 2 1/2 year old because he is very interested in the alphabet.  The dvd was a huge disappointment because it didn't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words, etc.  Not suitable for my son's age, boring and short.  They sing a 60 second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked.  Not a good buy+dvd
I wish I could go lower than this. +N+This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny.+dvd
Not to be mean But there's a true absence of a development+N+Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series+dvd
Sorry I bought this+N+This DVD is very cheesy and I am sorry I bought it.+dvd
Enough twists to keep you entertained+P+While not on the level of "The Interpreter" in terms of plot depth and character development, "Cellular" delivers what it says it will: a fast paced, tense thriller that will please most people. The plot is complex enough to keep the watcher guessing what exactly will happen and not bore the audience. There are a number of tense scenes that add to the overall suspense and thrill of the movie. If you're in the mood for a fast paced thriller this will not disapoint you.+dvd
Great Set A Must Buy for Fans+P+Excellent even more than the average DVD films success! with miles of bonus content and footage. Plus commentary and bonus features for children and the family to enjoy for all ages. If i was to give a chritsmas gift this would be one to remember+dvd
W.T.F?+N+This movie does not make sense. And it's not weird in the style of David Lynch, it's just complete crap. I thought Willie Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was the worst/stupidest fil ever until i saw this. Do not buy this. It is not a family movie, and it is not funny or entertaining+dvd
Chick Flick Hell+N+*Warning: Spoiler* I cannot believe people, excuse me, some women are giving this movie four and five stars.  Interesting premise,and it could have been a good, believeable movie-- but it was sooo syrupy. If this is what it's like to be in love, please somebody shoot me(note: I've been in real love for 27 years now.) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end. Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a "good movie"? I felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over. Wouldn't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out? That, at least, would have made the movie more intriquing, believeable and redeeming. If ever a movie was made to force tears, this is it.  This movie stinks and I don't mind telling you so--and it's not just because I'm a man either. Imo, there's not much difference between this movie and a stupid, blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it's the elixir of heaven. Same coin, different sides.   The movie should be given a "one"--no a "negative one" just for the stupid ending, but other redeeming factors make it a "two." Still not worth seeing--i.e., unless you're into infuriating yourself.  **  Note: Even my wife and daughter--both chick-flick connousiours--hate this movie.I haven't checked yet, but I think my dogs do too.**    Another note: These two good actors needed a better movie. See Ryan in the superb "Courage Under Fire", or the Jim Morrison movie, or "When Harry Met Sally"--which I don't categorize as a "chick flick" but as a good romantic comedy,i.e., not contrived+dvd
Spielbergs' worst?+N+Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite "Always" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style+dvd
a valuable documentary+P+To me, this film is worth owning, not just renting to see once. One only wishes it could be updated continually, especially to include 2005's Brokeback Mountain. However, it has so many gems that I recommend it for gathering so much history together+dvd
The funnyiest satir ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+If you love sick ghetto humor this is your show. It's like an mixture of Southpark, Family guy, Stand up comedys (like Eddy Murphys Raw etc) see it and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+dvd
Perhaps the Most Overrated Film Ever+N+I've seen this several times over the years and still can't make sense of why it's such a favorite. The acting is subpar, the drama cheesy and in my opinion as an active duty sailor, fails quite miserably to capture the true spirit of being in the Navy. To think that lunatic Tom Cruise practically built a career off of this garbage...sigh..+dvd
very stagnant+N+I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies+dvd
Lackluster and sometimes inaccurate+N+NOVA isn't what it used to be.  The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people+dvd
Top notch entertainment+P+I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a "blockbuster" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a "blockbuster". But it's also a damn good story, as  mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous "You can't handle the truth...." line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either+dvd
so bad it scared me out of eating+N+i watched troll 2 on showtime beyond(showtime's horror/sci-fi movie channel) and like the movie itself is SO bad it's laughable!  i mean the part where joshua screams out "your a genius big sister" nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing  the movie takes place in a small town where EVERYONE is a vegan  and like the religous people there have a phobia towards those who eat meat and they are "unpure" if they eat it which ironically saves johusa in the movie by eating a double decker sandwich with meat  the goblins in this movie ARE creepy esspeically the one with the bolding eyes EEK!  anyway thoughout the flim joshua is looking at pictures of CREEPY looking trolls which is ironic considering it's golibins   anyway in the movie the only way for the golibins to eat is for someone to eat something so they could eat them!  i'm not a child but that still is a scary thought!  after watching this movie i didn't look at green and red the same way again nor could i eat much   only watch this movie if you are looking for a  laugh+dvd
Back to the future... of impossible romance?+N+If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie+dvd
Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?+N+OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics+dvd
Definitely not one of Arnold's best...+N+Eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot. This movie possibly will be owned by many, but remembered by few. James Caan was the only talent that Eraser has to offer. Sorry guys, my wife bought it, I watched it, gave it away and divorced her+dvd
"Can Anyone Play?"+P+First off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie.  When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, "Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?" She looks so sweet and hot that it's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later.  However she pulls ift off pretty well.  In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well.  I couldn't understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing.  I give it 5 stars because it's both fun and funny, and of course very hot at times.  Well worth a look...+dvd
absolutely amazing+P+The most amazing portrayal of the Anne Frank story that I have ever seen. Keep a box (or two) of tissues with you and prepare to cry buckets of tears+dvd
A landmark film!   +P+This surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms, the double moral, the frivolity, epidemical visions, unresolved gilts, an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of Rabelais or Moliere.  One of the freest films in any age and a milestone reference picture. Another sublime artistic feat of Federico Fellini; these dilemmas, far from being diminishing, have been growing up, what it proves its magisterial precognition and penetrating sights in the social body.         A must see! +dvd
One of the Best!!+P+This was the third Anime series i had ever seen.  The first was Cowboy Bebop, then Outlaw Star.   With that in mind, realize that i saw this entire series on ONE sunday afternoon-night. This was the first "giant robot" series i had ever seen.    I was VERRRRRRRRRRRRY dissapointed with the ending and have not seen the movies yet, but i still really enjoyed the show.  This series offers emotional reaction that i had not felt from any other show or movie in years...  This collection at such a low price is an absolute value, my only advice is to skip most of the 5th or 6th? disc and watch the directors versions of the last 4 or 5 episodes on the last disc instead+dvd
A great leadership movie+P+As an Active Duty Air Force Officer, this has to be by far the best leadership movie ever for newly commissioned Officers and NCO's. +dvd
25 Words or Less+P+Engaging Characters, Interesting Plots, Decent Writing/Translating, Fabulous Animation, Great Music (opening song is in russian, english, and latin).  And Tachikomas!  There!  20 Words!  You don't have to be a fanatic (or "otaku" as we otaku like to say) about this stuff to like it.  A word about the Tachikomas: they are tank robots the size of a VW bug and designed like spiders, and they are definately with the "Good Guys".  They can even shoot "silk" and cling to the sides of buildings.  And they sound (and frequently act) like children.  You would never think of saying a robot that looks like a spider was *cute*, but the Tachis'll win you over+dvd
PLEASE STOP THE CRYING ALREADY :- (.........+P+I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone's movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-) +dvd
Excellent Technicality+P+I heard many mixed opinions about this DVD but I'm glad that I finally decided to buy one for myself. Lang Lang's fingers are like flying upon the piano. His facial expression may seem distracting but I take it nothing more than an artist's expression of his own enjoyment in the music.  Great music! not to be missed.  I do hope to see more of his DVDs coming.+dvd
Good but flawed Spielberg+P+"Munich" is not one of Steven Spielberg's best films,but it is still worth watching due mainly to a brilliant cast.Eric Bana,Geoffrey Rush, and Daniel Craig are especially outstanding.The film also has an  impressive physical production and a haunting John Williams score. But there are problems.For one thing,it's too long.That seems to be  a problem many directors have today.Why do all of today's big movies have to run nearly three hours?Spielberg could have cut half an hour,and the film would have been much better.But the biggest problem is that Spielberg,Kushner,and Roth have really stacked the deck for Israel here. The story is entirely one-sided.There is an excellent scene where the Arab and Israeli agents confront each other,and the three filmmakers would have been wise to pursue that angle.Instead,no explanation is given to the Arabs'side or to WHY they seized the athletes in the first place.The result is a decidedly unbalalnced story.And the ending is ambiguous.Still, "Munich" is an ambitious film worth watching+dvd
i so loved this movie so much!+P+This movie is so comforting to me. Its sweet, funny and def. gives you a message. No matter how green the grass may seem (A  man that has a lot on his plate: Kevin Bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman) it's not always. moral of the story is you need to go with your heart. He realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his "single self" I absolutely love this movie.  love the music, love the actors, love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby. too funny! :) +dvd
Collateral+N+It's amazing just how quickly I decided this movie really sucks. A music video without the music! For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for. +dvd
A disappointment in a way...+N+For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon+dvd

HuH?+N+This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it left me just feeling sad that I spent money to buy it.  The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable.. well, I should have seen it coming. However, there are a couple of funny moments.  That's why I give this movie one star+dvd
THE MIRACLE OF ... WHAT?+N+This is my first time in this forum  I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE  AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist.   I choose the first option.   Are you so kind  -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ?  Yours  R+dvd
don't be &quot;con&quot; vinced into watching this+N+To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars+dvd
low tech, high intrigue jackal+P+old fashioned political/spy thriller from the cold war era. head and shoulders above bruce willis '90s re-make without the over the top violence and weaponry. somewhat dated, but characters are well defined and beleivable and the single shot rifle disguised as a crutch, i want one!. this jackal is cold-blodded, ruthless and real+dvd
An interesting look at the Broadway wet dream+P+This musical is about wanting to get out of the life you live.  In the case of Shirley Maclaine's character, it's about her finally trying to stop compromising on her ideals of love and quit her hypocritical( hypocritical considering her remarks about truly believing in love) job as a dancehall hostess.  In addition to conversely demonstrating the shallow nature of the Broadway musical dream and how even love can seem insincere on a grand lofty scale, they also inject these ideas with quirky humor which distracts from just how insipid these characters would seem if played straight.  The funny thing about this film is that it is both a satire and completely honest in it's depiction of life.  It also contains excellent choreography and music whose flash demonstrates the appeal of such things.  Depicting all of these differing and seemingly contradictory thoughts makes the viewer not know how they feel about the whole thing.  Personally, after the film was over I was left with the callow sense of whimsy and was amazed at how willing I was to be entertained by this.  Apparently the stage version has a different ending so I hope that at some point I'll be able to see it+dvd
Pretty, but vacant.+N+Immortel (ad vitam) (Enki Bilal, 2004)  While I was not overly impressed with Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy on the page, I figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride, and with Bilal himself at the helm, I had high hopes for it. Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes.  The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The "sets," though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted.  The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen  in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough.  The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion.  In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone. +dvd
abouut the movie lionheart.......+P+The story basically talks about Van Damme running away from army work to hekp his brother's family to overcome financially after his bother was killed by some 'gansters' or something. He earn his income throught some underground fighting which he later give to his brother's wife(if I've not forgotten the story). They are good numbers of action fighting scenes which I could say is a remarkable effort put into this movie/film. The only problem is that this movie/film is using indication of knife which is rather unsuitable for kids (that type of thing, the 'bear' issue or this..chinese) to watch. A very good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film.....Enjoy....

Hilarious+P+This movie is HILARIOUS. It is Jennifer Aniston's best movie to date. She normally bombs in every movie IMO, but here is the perfect role for her. Ben stiller is SO funny as Ruben. The bathroom scene had me in tears I laughed so hard+dvd
Rule of Law determines whether a Soldier is a barbarous or civilized+P+Defense argued, "Law does not exist in the Confederate prison.  Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law", "these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive", "only rebel law applies in the prison".   Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, "we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics.  What about us?"  Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft.    The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging.  The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized.  Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft;  however, once intolerance levels are hit,  a violent revolution transpires.  The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial.  However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders.   The "Great Escape" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville.  The story line had a ton of similarities.    Andersonville has a fair share of violence.   At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead.   Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops.  Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer.  Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime.  Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting.  Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie.  The characters were passionate, compelling, and captivating.+dvd
Superb documentary+P+What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void.   The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it.  Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened  economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.+dvd
Love Triangle - Civil War Style+P+Just who will hot New York fashion designer Melanie Carmichael (aka Melanie Smooter) choose? Her heart is torn like a north and south divide between first husband Jake in Alabama and fiance Andrew, the JFK-like son of Manhattan's mayor who plans to groom her son to Presidental status. After Andrew proposes Melanie must rush through a divorce with Jake only to find that after 7 years of running away, she is still a Southern Belle at heart.  Melanie's torn heart is like a civil war clash as her accent changes back and forth to reflect her inner turnoil and personality identity confusion. Just who is she? She wonders as her marriage preparations are underway. Is she the chick New York fashion designer who creates clothes that are picked up my high-end retail stores all over the country? Is she the Manhattan socialite who has nabbed the most elibible bachelor in town? Or is she a southern belle confederate sweetheart still in love with her first love? Is she really truly just Melanie Smooter Perry who inspired Jake to make something of himself when she left after a miscarrage?  The only way to know is to watch her walk down the aisle a second time+dvd
About man's goodness in the face of adversity+P+Kurosawa's magnificent homage to the poor and suffering in the world. Set in a rural health clinic in the 1800s, Toshiro Mifune plays the kindly but dictatorial head doctor, and Yuzo Kayama is a young, selfish, and self-centered intern who comes reluctantly to the clinic and learns humility. Through magnificent acting and superior direction, the movie captures the heart-rending trials and tribulations of these peasant people.   Three "stories" predominate: a totally selfless man's death-bed cenfession about his wife and his loyalty to her; a 12-year-old girl's learning that there are good people in the world; and a 7-year-old boy's family who takes poison rather than starve any longer. There is a haunting scene where women are "calling back" the life of a boy from a well, according to a folk belief. At three hours the movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's fair to say we don't lose interest for a minute. Kurosawa called this "a monument to the goodness in man." Indeed. Definitely worth a watch+dvd
no title+P+Kingsley surely deserved another best supporting actor Oscar, and Fishburne was wonderful as always.  A really super flic.  Zallian scripted the terrific "Awakenings" with Robert De Niro+dvd
interesting, thought provoking film+P+The previews for this film caught my attention, so I rented it as soon as it came out. It was a very interesting and thought provoking film. How would three people with different languages and different cultures interact, especially if two of them are enemies? This film explores that question. The performances were outstanding, and the film was beautifully and artisticly done. Much of it was very funny, as the audience is let in on both what WAS being said and what was THOUGHT to be being said. One example of this is Ivan being called Gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling Veiko to get lost. Even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating. While this film is rated PG-13, parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it (I wouldn't). This is because of some issues of religion and morality (to say more would give to many plot spoilers).+dvd
It happened and is " Still Happening"+P+The truth hurts. While it hurts, it is also much harder to swallow. These are issues that require consumption by everyone+dvd
Such a sad way to end the series...+N+I fell in love with the Anne of Green Gables series when someone loaned us the first movie.  I immediately went out and bought the books and found the 2nd movie that Sullivan made.  The first two movies were outstanding and did an excellent job of telling Montgomery's story of Anne.  Like many other fans of Anne, I anxiously awaited the third movie, hoping to see the marriage of Anne and Gilbert and the beginning of their married life and the starting of their family.  There is wonderful drama in the books of this period of their lives.  I thought, too, that a final movie would be very successful if it dealt with the wartime drama situated around Anne & Gilbert's oldest daughter, Rilla.  What Sullivan presented, however, after two wonderful movies, was not only a desecration of Montgomery's writings, but also just a bad movie.  If you have recently discovered Anne of Green Gables and love these tremendous stories, I strongly recommend that you buy the first two movies.  By staying close to the text, Sullivan managed to deliver two incredible movies, and Meegan Follows is simply incredible.    Based upon Sullivan's commentary's in the movies, however, we should consider ourselves lucky he got these movies right, because he really doesn't seem to "get" what makes Montgomery's stories so wonderful.  This is even more apparent with the 3rd movie, which I can only guess Sullivan put out there to try and make some extra money.  First of all, it has nothing to do with Montgomery's actual stories.  Sullivan should have kept to directing and left story telling to Montgomery.  Second, the movie is just bad.  It was a couple of hours that, unfortunately, I'll never get back again.  As other reviewers have commented, I own the first two movies and love to watch them with my family.  They are *perfect* family movies with incredible stories and superb acting.  The last movie shouldn't even be considered part of the story.  It's bad.  Don't waste any money on it+dvd
'70s Noir+P+This is a relatively unknown film noir from the mid '70s, starring Gene Hackman as a former football player turned private eye who is obsessed by a chess game from the '20s, where one of the players missed a forced mate, and lost instead. He's hired by a wealthy former hollywood starlet to track down her daughter, which takes him to some of the seedier parts of the Florida Keys you'll ever see on film.  As is common in other noirs, just about everyone in this film is corrupt, even including Hackman's character himself, to a certain point. As noted by another reviewer, this movie will remind many of 'Chinatown'. In the end, just about everyone loses.  I have a copy of this on VHS, and I bought the DVD for the widescreen. I was impressed by the image quality of the DVD -- it's a little grainy, but overall, quite high quality. I don't think anyone's going to be very disappointed by the transfer, considering it's a mid '70s film. The only extras are some trailers, and a sort of short documentary on the director.  Hackman is terrific in this, as he is in most of his other films. He can play genial one moment, and a moment later play cynical and tough. It's too bad he didn't get another opportunity at another role like this. Unfortunately, they don't really make films like this anymore+dvd
Horrible+N+Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful+dvd
Cheap Switcheroo...+N+Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the "new" slimline Thinpak.  Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least.  They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style.  SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)??  This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to "head shots" of Simpsons characters.  After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases.  Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price.  Gotta love that marketing plan!  I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school+dvd
WISH WISH WISH never bought this DVD+N+I tried the abs workout and because it's twisting you in a weird way, I injured my tail bone. That was in February of 2004. Since then, to this day I have pain (similar to arthritis) in my tailbone that gets aggravated from various activities, so I have to really watch out. I have better days and worse days. Once it does get aggravated, I'm doomed for weeks till it calms down. It's so annoying since I'm only 31 and it hurts right now even when I'm walking (I feel like I'm 71)  I wish I had never come across this DVD!!!+dvd
Buy the Original Cast (1953) Instead+N+IMHO, none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, etc.  These shows are all about the music - if the music doesn't make it, the whole production isn't worth two cents. +dvd
Great Popcorn flick+P+This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing. Kevin Spacey is perfect in this movie, and Benicio Del Torro and Gabriel Bryne do well in it too. The plot seems to be nothing out of the ordinary action/hiest/shoot-em-up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today's movie theaters, but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one. All great movies should have great endings, and this one does+dvd
Don't waste your money+N+Unless your almost dead this DVD is just too easy and is not really Yoga. I have an old Rodney Yee VHS 20 minute tape that was great for a quickie and thought this was the same in DVD. It is not+dvd
The Plots have no equal+P+My mother turned me on to this and it has been fun..  A pleasure to watch, not only for the Monk's character (worth the price alone), but for the ingenious plots. Check the Airport episode for a Woody Allen, in an stopped elevator, with a life insurance agent (Season 2: maid episode, season 3: 2yr old boy episode). Do yourself a favor and escape into a fun plotted twist of puzzlements, laughter, and of course: fitting the last pieces into a place with the Ahhh!! of satisfaction. Note some episodes better than others+dvd
a beautiful, moving cinematic masterpiece +P+One of the most recent additions to my film collection is Vï¿½ctor Erice's Espï¿½ritu de la colmena (The spirit of the Beehive), made in 1973 in Spain.  Franco's dictatorship was in its waning years - but the censorship the Generalissimo had fostered still remained in effect - many directors of the day had to fight to have their films shown.  If they portrayed anything that had to do with the Spanish Civil War - especially showing the Resistance in a favorable light - they had to do it metaphorically.  Some films were cut to ribbons by the censors, some were delayed almost indefinitely - and some never saw the light of day (or the dark of a cinema, if you like).  Erice's first feature is set in 1940, and shows a Spain still reeling from the pain of the civil war.  Set in a small village on the Castilian plain, the film speaks volumes about both the physical and psychological damage done by the conflict.  The village is seen to be quite run down - the family at the center of the story lives in relative comfort in a large old manor house, but it, too, is in a state of neglect and disrepair.  While quite spacious compared to the homes of their neighbors, the rooms are shown to contain little furniture - and the one meal we see the family sharing, a breakfast, is a sparse one.  The members of the family seem to exist in their own isolated orbits - coming close to each other at times, but never really connecting.  The two young sisters - Ana (Ana Torrent) and Isabel (Isabel Tellerï¿½a) - share more of a bond than the parents have with each other, or with their children.  The girls' father (portrayed by popular Spanish actor Fernando Fernï¿½n Gï¿½mez) is a beekeeper - the first time we see him in the film, he's tending the hives, dressed in his protective gear, looking a bit like a space explorer.  Their mother (Teresa Gimpera) writes letters to an unnamed man - from the address seen on an envelope in one scene, a refugee from the fighting living in a camp in France.  We never learn if he is a former lover, a relative, or just an old friend caught up in forces over which he has little control - but from the frequency of her letters to him, and the emotional depth of the words she writes (which we hear in a voice-over), it's obvious this is a person about whom she cares a great deal, and whose absence torments her.  The girls are the real focus of the story - especially the youngest, Ana.  She appears to be around 6 years old - at that age when the fantasies of childhood are about to be pushed aside by the realities of life, a time of difficult transition for a child.  She still accepts everything she sees as being real - fiction is an unknown concept to her.  A travelling cinema comes to town, setting up in the town hall - it's clearly something that has happened before, and we see the children gather around the van, before the dust has even settled, clamoring to know what film will be shown.    On this occasion, it happens to be James Whale's 1931 classic version of Frankenstein.  Ana and Isabel are among the children and adults who crowd into the makeshift theatre to see the film.  Ana is captivated by the entire spectacle - and as I mentioned, she's at the age when everything she sees on the screen is as real to her as what she sees on the street everyday.  Ana Torrent, the young actress who portrays Ana in the film, had never seen Frankenstein before - and in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film, we see her face in the dark, illuminated only by the light reflecting from the screen, as she reacts, honestly and openly, eyes wide in wonder, not acting, to the story before her.  At one point, she leans over to her sister Isabel and asks, `Why did the monster kill the little girl?  Why did they kill the monster?'  Isabel tells her later, as the girls lie in their beds, awaiting sleep, that `it's all make-believe - nothing in the movies is real'.  Ana's not buying it.  Still obsessed with the experience and story of the film, she later listens intently to a story Isabel tells her of a spirit that lives nearby, in an abandoned barn.  Isabel warns Ana that the spirit will only appear when called by someone with a pure heart, who believes it is real.  Ana returns to the barn several times, calling `It's me - Ana', to no avail.  After a few visits, she arrives at the barn to find it occupied - a wounded freedom fighter, on the run from Franco's guard, has taken shelter there.  When he awakens with a start, hearing a noise, he immediately draws his pistol - seeing that it's Ana, he relaxes.  Ana is either determined that this man is the spirit she has been seeking, or simply decides to make him into the spirit, and befriends him - she offers him an apple, and later sneaks out of her house with her father's jacket, to keep the man warm at night, inadvertently neglecting to remove her father's pocket watch before handing it over to him.  Ana's vision of this man as her own manifestation of the spirit is shattered when he is caught by Franco's police and killed.  Her father is called to the makeshift morgue - once again, using the town hall, returning to the scene of the film that affected Ana so much - to view the body.  The police captain has found the pocket watch on the dead man, and has connected it to Ana's father - he's obviously been brought in for questioning, probably a common practice in a society under the shadow of Franco's paranoia.  His assurances that he didn't know the man, or how his jacket and watch came to be in his possession, are evidently taken as truth, and he is allowed to take his property and go home.  When he confronts Ana with the watch, simply by opening it at the breakfast table and allowing the chiming mechanism to sound, it's pretty apparent from her facial expression that she knows something about it.  He later follows her to the barn - she doesn't know that the man has been captured and killed - and when her father attempts to talk with her there, she runs from him.  Her failure to return home prompts a search party made up of villagers scouring the woods and countryside at night, carrying lanterns - a striking visual reminder of the scene in Whale's Frankenstein when the villagers searched for the monster carrying torches.  Ana is found sleeping in the ruins of an old castle, and brought home, obviously traumatized.  As we see her sleeping in the room she shares with Isabel, we notice that Isabel's bed has been stripped of its linen - perhaps a sign that Isabel, being a couple of years older, is now in her own room, having `grown up' sufficiently in the eyes of her parents to warrant this `promotion'.  Ana's experiences have left her changed - but how much is unclear.  The border she has crossed - or is beginning to take the first steps in crossing, at least - is one that is not skipped over in the course of a day or two.  It's something that takes years to accomplish.  As the film ends, we see her poignantly calling out to her spirit once more, `It's me - Ana'.  The cinematography in this film is astonishingly beautiful - Luï¿½s Cuadrado worked miracles, not just in his camera angles and framing, but in capturing the honey-colored light that is so essential in conveying the feeling and atmosphere of this film.  In the documentary The footprints of a spirit - one of the several fine extras included in Criterion's new DVD release of the film - director Vï¿½ctor Erice and his co-screenwriter Angel Fernï¿½ndez Santos, speak of their original intended storyline, and how they wound up discarding the opening scenes - they said that once they started filming, they realized that the opening, looking back from the present to the time depicted in the body of the film, was a drag on the overall effect.  It's an interesting look into the creative process.  As it turned out, the film is as close to perfect as cinema can get.  Criterion has done a masterful job in restoring and packaging it for re-release.  Since I've never had the opportunity to see this work in a theatre on the big screen, I have nothing with which to compare it - but I can say that this is one of the most beautifully filmed, moving cinematic creations I've ever experienced.+dvd
Dissapointing second season with some good moments +N+Overall I found the season to be a big bore. I am not a hugh fan and season 1 was pretty good but not great but I had to watch this season and will continue to watch the other season's. The season started good but went downhill fast becouse nothing happend you can miss all season adn it will be right were you left off. There are good moments like the last few episodes were really good. Overall not a great second season+dvd
**Stories & More Stories From The Acoustic Highway**+N+First off let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of Edwin McCain, his band, and his music.  I bought this DVD thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing, but was only left with my pocket's empty, and my hopes shattered.  Edwin McCains personality is portrayed here, as all other reviewers have said, but that really is all that this DVD does well.  With only about 15 minutes of Live music I, as a viewer was left asking myself why Edwin and ATC Records decided to put this disc out.  The only notable music on this DVD is "I'll Be".  This is very easily Edwin's lowest quality item put out, lacking the passion, and originiality that so many of us know him by.  A noteworthy Story, if not the only one is the story of how he wrote I'll Be, and the only reason that it is noteworthy, is not because it is a great story, but rather I'll Be is a great track.  So if you have money to spare, and time to waste then you can buy this DVD, but unless Edwin releases a new DVD I suggest, that you stick to his CD's+dvd
A Big Waste Of Time!!!!+N+I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder+dvd
Amazingly bad--- don't buy it, don't even rent it!+N+This film is unwatchable-- and the only question is what talented actors like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver are doing in this insipid hack job.  When it comes to dialogue, not a single word rings true. None of the characters make any sense at all. They are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull, and so ridiculously unbelievable, that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words, rather than a cognizant human being.   We couldn't get through it, as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about. I see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end.  It's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey+dvd
Just what a movie should be!+P+This movie takes you away for 90 minutes into the arms of someone who can deliver a line so effortlessly you forget he is an actor.  He and Miss Graham are a delighful odd couple and Miss Driver, trying to find a place to smoke in America, is perfect British allure.   If you are a Colin Firth fan, it is worth every penny+dvd
Movie is TOP - DVD is a FLOP!+N+This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous.  But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer.  This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick+dvd
Empty shell+N+I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone.      +dvd
A Confused New Order fanatic!+P+Can someone PLEASE let me know if this is the DVD box set titled ITEM.  Some reviwers say it is, others insist it isn't.  Based on Amazon's product description it sounds as if this is the ITEM set.  Regardless, Amazon need to correct either the DVD title or the content description.  I'd just like to say that, personally, New Order peaked with Technique.  Everything they released up to and including that LP was BRILLIANT.  The Perfect Kiss promo video is sublime.   If this is the ITEM box set, it's worth owning just to see the full length version of the UK made NewOrderStory documentary.   It's a pity what became of New Order. They were once BRILLIANT.  +dvd
Getting Older Not Better+N+The Prisoner of Azkaban  Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.  The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]  Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class?+dvd
If you are looking for a real documentary, this is not it+N+The editor decided that I don't want to see how the plane crashes into WTC, or how people jump from windows, so, he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else. Instead, there is a plenty of news people's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking (and why do I care?), plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left.+dvd
I have got two words to descibes what I thought of this...+N+AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH!  I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake.  The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please".+dvd
1 STAR FOR UNIVERSAL'S PISS POOR TRANSFER TO DVD+N+This show is my all time favorite, however Universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser, and a wrong Season Premier Intro!  DVD is meant to bring out the best in media, not the worst, how could they lose sound effects? Unbelievable! Just doesn't seem possible... SEASON 4 is no better...  UNIVERSAL PLEASE READ THIS AND RE-RELEASE SEASON 3 AND 4 ALREADY, THE FANS ARE EXTREMELY PISSED OFF!+dvd
Good retelling of a great anime series+P+'Escaflowne', the movie, is basically a retelling of the popular (and wonderful) series. However the movie is a lot darker, a lot of characters in the series have been left out, and some events have been altered, so do not expect to see a movie that stays true to and anime series. For example, movies like (Cowboy Bebop, 4 of Inuyasha movies, 3 of DragonBall movies, 10 of DragonBall Z movies, Blue Gender the movie, Yu Yu Hakusho the movie)+dvd
Horrid!+N+This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories.  There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy+dvd
Save your money+N+Soft core porn masquerading as art, I didn't even make it through the first half hour of this film. Lola's cute, but it's still not worth the effort+dvd
I wish I could have rated it 0 star+N+I decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it. I watched it with my girlfriend. Bad idea... The sex scenes are bad and very short, and the rest is downright boring. This movie is simply bad, and slow, and generally laughable+dvd
never did get it.+N+sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book,  a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper+dvd
Some good raunchy fun to watch+P+Look out "Sluts in the City!", The Brits have beat you to the punch and did a much better job to boot! If you want to see some outstanding satire of the loony fringes of society. I can safely recommend this for your consideration. Its pricey but worth it+dvd
not my favorite seasons but still a must own....+P+I had never watched Mr. Show up  until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited.  I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest.  I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four.  A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone+dvd
A Great Propagandist that would of made Gobbels proud+N+Chomsky is nothing more than a liberal propaganda artist. His views that the Stalinist Military defeated Nazi Germany is proof of his leanings. He is the left wing Rush Limbaugh of written media+dvd
i guess i'm the only person on here that finds this one the PITS!!!+N+this never rises above the slease and sexualy warped mind of mr. de palma. angie dickison's shower scenes are just a sick joke like the whole movie. watch a hitchcock movie if you want a good thriller,and stay away from this junk!!+dvd
Lethal Western+P+With a renewed interest of the "Western" genre in 80's & 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying "I'm getting too old for this  ----!") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western.  Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride.  James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper.  Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it.  The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc.  Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy  "Angel", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does.  The closing scenes with Garner & Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying.  Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect+dvd
Great Tidbits+P+I didn't love everything about this film.  In fact, the first time I saw it, I felt it was lacking in depth.  But the second time I watched it, many little moments shone through and I saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed.  First, Payton's performance as Andrew really hit a few times.  When he first starts warming up to Christian (as Christian grows more confident) by responding to Christian's teasing, I thought this was some complex and genuine emotions.  There's a great "you bitch, okay, let me see that" moment.    Second, I liked Aaron's genuineness when Bisset's character is suffering and he knows he doesn't have anything to make her feel good.  I also like the fact that he put Bisset's character's needs ahead of his own agenda of converting people.    Finally, I thought the best moment was between Aaron and his mom (Mary Kay Place) as Place's character begins to comprehend the suffering of her  son and begins to get past her prejudices.    After my second viewing, I fell in love with the film.  Worth owning. +dvd
Madagascar+P+This is a cute movie.  The creators of this one have one fabulous imagination.  I highly recommend watching this film.  However, this is not for small children. +dvd
John Ford/John Wayne  : American Classics+P+I ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself, and I wasn't disapointed.  The new print of "The Searchers" with all the extras(lobby cards,reprint of the dell comic, and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set--   In addition you get a two dvd set for Stagecoach(which started the Ford/Wayne partnership),Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,3 Godfaters,They Were Expendable,Wings Of Eagles, and The Long Voyage Home.  The only thing I would have chaged is that I would have made almost All the movies in this set westerns(The Searchers,Stagecoach,Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,Rio Grande,3 Godfathers,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Quiet Man(which isn't a western, but I think it fits in well)would have been my choice for the set.  That aside I think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of John Ford(or John Wayne)will not be disappointed.+dvd
Don't hesitate to buy RENT+P+I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!  +dvd
No Diamonds....Just Rough+N+This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity+dvd
Another over rated movie+N+Please do not compare this with Clock Work Orange. It's shame. This movie is shame on director. Cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good. This movie is like B grade stuff.   Plot is good, but not the direction or screen play+dvd
not quite as enthralling as I had hoped...+N+Granted, I should have seen this coming, having read Louisa May Alcott's predictable preteen novel before buying the film version. I guess I was hoping that the movie would fix up all the flat characterizations and narrow plotlines I had lamented while reading Alcott's early piece. Alas, I put too much faith in cinema. The movie did absolutely nothing to improve upon the book. The main female character is far too demure and morally perfect to connect in any real way with her audience (which actually seems to sell more books than I would think, as per Janette Oke) and the female antagonist is villified to the extent that she no longer seems human. The male love-interest is the traditional tall, dark, handsome, and vacuous one who, though faithful to his love, lacks any sort of purpose outside of wooing her.   Overarching these characterization flaws is a general lack of cinematographic care that relegates this movie to the "made-for-TV" genre, which, though not dominated solely by poor films, is not known for its quality. To me, it was much like watching a Lifetime movie: predictable, entertaining for lack of an alternative, and not terribly significant.   Don't read me incorrectly. This movie is great for anyone who is just plain bored. If you don't enjoy actually watching the movie, you will probably enjoy laughing incredulously as each character delivers horrible lines. Hey, it's only 6 bucks, anyway. Why not buy it and see for yourself? It's what I did, and just because I was disappointed doesn't mean you have to be+dvd
A great drama, with amazing depth+P+'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story.  The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.  Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the proffesor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neigborhood in south Boston.  As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.  Filled with great profound dialouges and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotinal experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertaints throughout. It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtelties+dvd
You've Got to be Kidding Me+N+While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.  So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?  I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.  Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.   +dvd
Not worth watching+N+All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over. +dvd
Wouldn't buy it again+N+This video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball.  I don't care for the woman who does it -- I find her personality a little annoying.  That aside, there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position.  This makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions.  It's nice the first time through because you are just learning.  But I would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position+dvd
Busy doing nothing+P+A drifter named Trinity (Terence Hill) slides into a dusty frontier town where he discovers his outlaw brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) is sheriff.  Disguised as sheriff, that is.  Bambino wants to rustle a herd of valuable horses; Trinity is enamored of a pair of comely Mormon lasses.    There's more to THEY CALL ME TRINITY than that, of course, but not a lot more.  The Mormons want to settle in a nearby valley and build a community.  An unscrupulous land-baron (Farley Granger) wants to intimidate them out.  There's a band of Mexican banditos swooping down every so often to test the resolve of the peace loving settlers. The draw of this one, though, is the quiet comedy and the interplay between Hill and Spencer.  Hill's Trinity is lithe and tanned, Bambino is bearded and hulking - they've got a Little Joe & Hoss thing going.  Impossibly quick on the draw and dominating in all of the film's many fights, Trinity is about as laid-back a spaghetti western hero as you're going to find.  Heck, he rides in to and out of the movie barefoot and asleep on a makeshift stretcher dragged by his horse, holstered gun trailing in the dust.  Hollywood (and Italia) was cranking out counter-culture rebels with droning regularity back in the late sixties/early seventies, most with `off the man' `tudes and ten-pound chips on their shoulders.  What's refreshing about Trinity is that about the only thing he's rebelling against is physical exertion and grown-up responsibility.  Bambino may be a crook, but he's agreeably grumpy and, besides, those horses he wants to rustle belong to the evil Major.     THEY CALL ME TRINITY is usually called a comedy-western, but its humor provokes smiles rather than belly laughs. It's a good, fun, unchallenging way to spend an hour and a half.  Unfortunately, the Direct Source video version is pretty hard on the eyes.  It's presented in full-screen, edited down from its 2.35:1 aspect ration.  Worst of all the picture looks like it was duped off a bad video tape - indistinct images, faded colors, etc.  This one isn't a classic, but it's one of the better spaghetti westerns, and deserves a better presentation than it gets here.   +dvd
GREAT DVD!!+P+This DVD is great for Adults and Children alike... Filled with hours of Pluto!+dvd
The Magic Continues+P+Its very rare when a sequel holds the same magical charm as its first but this sequel has done just that. If you loved the first movie, you'll be equally pleased with this one. The original cast along with holding true to the book series makes this a must see+dvd
RPMJr+P+Good action flick. Being from Detroit made the movie even cooler. The way it all went down had me on the edge, great suspence+dvd
Superb documentary+P+What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void.   The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it.  Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened  economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.+dvd
Excellent makeover for a masterpiece+P+Many of the other reviews have summarized Akira Kurosawa's excellent film, so I won't recap it since you are probably familiar with The Seven Samurai.  Rather, if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release, rest easy.  It is well worth the price.  Having seen the movie many, many times, I was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details I had missed.  The supplemental materials (commentaries, documentaries, interviews, and the booklet (with reminiscences from Mifune Toshiro) complement the movie nicely.    If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it.  This DVD is worth it+dvd
Not True to the Book+N+My twelve year old who read and loved the E. Nesbit book Five Children and It hated this movie.  I have also read the book, and the movie has very little in common with the original story.  There is no eccentric uncle and cousin Horace or secret door in the greenhouse.  The children are not sent to the country because of the war.  Even the wishes the children make are not true to the book.  My nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book.   So, although it is pleasant, clean, family entertainment, I think E. Nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book.  It seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized E. Nesbit's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from C.S. Lewis' Chronicle of Narnia series+dvd
Box set 3 will be the last set...+N+There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3..  Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut?  in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles..  Mike Judge the ultimate tool..  huh huh, he said tool+dvd
Laramie Project+P+dvd arrived in condition stated and within the estimated delivery time.  thank you+dvd
Meet John Doe+N+I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now+dvd
Contains the best song in the world's: Tribute!+P+This duo led by Jack Black is flipping sweet!  Jack's sax-a-boom absolutely rips the audience into shreds.  This is fun music.  (Not for the kids' ears, per se, but if they're teens I'll bet they've already borrowed the album from a friend that has older siblings that grow weed and otherwise contribute to your kids' delinquency.  Buy this so when you catch them listening to the album you can both sit down together and really bond over some cool tunes.+dvd
It's a entertaining film but not everyone can embrace Sincity.+P+Sin city wasn't really the type of film that everyone would appreciate, one must remember this film comes right out a comic book, i love Bruce Willis is like one of my favorite actors and he had the perfect voice to do the story telling, his character role was let's say typical Bruce, it can be considered a simple story with a light twist, the plot was reasonable and all in all enjoyable at least for me, i say it's worth a watch laterz folks.+dvd
Totally Worth It+P+Just the packaging alone makes this box set worthwhile. I've never seen anything like it. The exterior is like a Trapper Keeper, slick plastic that's kind of puffy and soft to the touch. It then folds out into four DVD trays and has a really well designed booklet, talking about the films and the genre (Sukeban). I just got my copy and everyone that's been over and seen it has flipped out about the box, `cause it just looks so cool (and is so pink). The bonus CD of Reiko Ike singing is mounted in with the booklet and is weird and kind of a novelty. I put it on at a party a couple of weeks ago and people were way into it.  The movies are cool too. "Criminal Woman: Killing Melody" is my favorite, but the end of "Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess" is amazing. There's no way that Quentin Tarintino didn't see it before he made "Kill Bill".  I just read on the website of the company that put out the set (Panik House) that they pre-sold 2/3 of the run of 10,000 and they think they're going to sell out soon, so if you're at all interested in getting a copy of this you should. Now. It was totally worth the money+dvd

It's about kids at a "musical camp" for wannabe performers+N+These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem.   There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people. +dvd
Damaged+N+I hear this is a good movie, but can't play it as the DVD is visibly damaged.  So what about Quality control?  This disc should never have gotten out the door, but the odd thing is, I ordered 2 DVD's from Amazon - different titles, both damaged.  Are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us?  "F+dvd
They may be grandmothers to the "Desperate Housewives," +P+but have things really changed that much since the late Forties?    This gem of a movie is a neglected classic of Americana. "A Letter to Three Wives" uses many of the same talents who made "All About Eve" such a hit a year later, most notably Joseph L. Mankiewicz as the writer/director and Celeste Holm, who is present here in voice only as Addie Ross, the town flirt.   Just as three of the town's more prominent clubwomen are about to depart on a day-long trip with underprivileged children, they receive a note from Addie--she has run off with one of their husbands. They have the whole day to think about which one it was. The Jeanne Crain character is insecure because she left her Iowa roots and married up to one of the town gentry. The Linda Darnell character was "shanty Irish" and married a department store millionaire with whom they share a rather grudging relationship. Ann Sothern plays a radio screenwriter who is trying to maneuver her way out of the second-best neighborhood in town into the very best.   Along with sharp observations about class and social climbing in small towns/suburbia, this film has sharp writing and acting and some genuinely funny moments, including a star turn from Kirk Douglas as a droll English teacher (bet you thought you'd never see HIM in a comedy!). Look for the wonderful Thelma Ritter as the maid from the wrong side of the tracks. All in all, "A Letter to Three Wives" is a great entertainment and a welcome addition to any video collection. I have seen my copy several times and introduced it to several people. +dvd
A little good, mostly bad...+N+I had seen scenes from this flick on IFC, so I finally decided to watch the whole thing.  While there are a few plusses, there are many more minuses.  There was some really good production design here, the cinematography was good, and there are some funny moments (one of the killers has a shirt on saying "cheap Halloween costume", and there's a poster for a missing dog head).  The performances by the 2 cops (in one scene anyway) are actually pretty good.  I think this has to do more with the 2 actors than Zombie's directorial skills.  Now the bad.  One reviewer has noted that essentially this is a remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except nowhere near as good (or intense).  First of all, you don't really give a damn about the victims here (2 couples who seem to despise each other).  They're really obnoxious and stupid at the beginning, and after they get abducted, tortured, and killed, you don't really care.  There are so many references to other horror films (and some blatant ripoffs, especially of Chainsaw) that it seems like a cover version rather than an original film.  The acting is obnoxious and pretty bad, except for the 2 cops.  But even their performances are strange.  They are only in 2 scenes.  They are absolute jerks in their first scene, but in their second scene, they show some depth and are sincere.  I think that's indictative of the movie.  Sometimes it seems it wants to be funny, other times horrific.  Of course, there's no real explanation to the actual "house of 1000 corpses" that one of the girls gets thrown into at the end of the film.  Zombie wasn't trying to be ambiguous or anything.  It just doesn't make a damn bit of sense.  And the ending sucks.  It seems that they just did it to give it a lame twist ending.  There are many plot holes (after the police are killed, there are no cops that follow up on it.  There would be in real life).  Overall, it's a pretty stupid film.      +dvd
Not enough variation+N+Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments.  The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves.  If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you+dvd
Wholesome, weird, and dull+N+This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz+dvd
Great lower body workout!!!+P+In just the first few minutes I began to feel the burn This workout works all the leg muscles. You will feel as though you have run a marathon!!!+dvd
Amazing Inspiration+P+If you enjoy adventure stories, and look up to those people who meet challenges placed before them; this is a DVD not to be missed.  Be sure to watch the "extra features" items on the DVD, as they take an incredible story, to even new heights as additional facts about Shackleton's journey are revealed, about this most incredible survivor story of all time.  A must watch for the entire family+dvd
a lot of effort, little substance.+N+There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie.  A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings.  I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film.  I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema.  A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today.  But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane.  There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon.  Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating.  This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance.+dvd
THE INSIDER ILLUSTRATES HOW 1 PERSON CAN STILL MAKE A HUGE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE+P+A TRUE STORY THAT'S STILL TOUCHING LIVES TODAY & FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE TOO   The Insider tells the true story of how Jeffrey Wigand [played by Russell Crowe] told the world what the major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers posed to consumers by their cigarettes. The Insider is presented with tangible class and with an appropriately heavy docudrama feel. In my opinion, "The Insider" is director Michael Mann's best film to date and was nominated for seven Academy awards. Excellent acting by Pacino, Crowe and Plummer.   YES - THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR BEING A WHISTLEBLOWER & IT COMES IN MANY THANKLESS FORMS!!!!!  The film's setting is saturated with an eerie and believable atmosphere of paranoia. The sinking feeling that the unseen enemy [the tobacco company] will be coming from somewhere seems to be both infectious and believable throughout the film. The price Wigand pays for his integrity is dear and continues to this day. His personal loss rivals the tobacco company's but unlike them he consciously decided to do the "right thing" regardless of that cost. Amplifying the significance of Wigand's whistle blowing decision, where in effect 1 man [Jeffrey Wigand] does stand up completely alone against the threats of big tobacco, CBS "Corporate" caves in to the tobacco company's lawsuit threats. After taping the interview CBS corporate hits the chicken switch over airing Mike Wallace's interview with Wigands much as the tobacco company had hoped the wistleblower would have. This subplot through analogy clearly demonstrates the power of one ordinary man against a powerful corrupt system and clearly illustrates how 1 person can still make a big difference. Jeffrey Wigand standing up to be counted did make a difference in this case. A HUGE DIFFERENCE!   YES - -1 PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE: A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE!  On a smaller scale the filmakers' effort here is another example of how 1 man can make a difference though the risk is far smaller. Interestingly, though the film was nominated for 7 academy awards it came away with none. I guess Whistleblowing for a just cause will still have to be its own reward.   * -- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST * -- *  Al Pacino  - Lowell Bergman  Russell Crowe  - Jeffrey Wigand  Christopher Plummer  - Mike Wallace  Diane Venora  - Liane Wigand  Philip Baker Hall  - Don Hewitt  Lindsay Crouse  - Sharon Tiller  Debi Mazar  - Debbie De Luca  Stephen Tobolowsky  - Eric Kluster  Colm Feore  - Richard Scruggs  Bruce McGill  - Ron Motley  Rip Torn  - John Scanlon  Lynne Thigpen  - Mrs. Williams  Nestor Serrano  - FBI Agent Robertson  Pete Hamill  - N.Y.

boring i fell asleep watching+N+Patrick Swayze worst movie ever you hardly ever seen him in the movie pluse you had to read the whole thing, Forest Whitaker scene's was probobly the best thing about the movie maybe This movie would of been much better without the Letter box Verson and  that's a big mayb+dvd
Laney Boggs was robbed...+N+I first saw this movie in high school-I believe i was a senior-And I remember thinking, "High school is NOT like this at all!" Throughout the whole movie. Now, I do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world, where anything is possible (except Laney Boggs becoming Prom Queen of course), but I felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie. First of all, why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a Prom Queen??? In my school, the Homecoming Court and Prom Court were chock full of nice, friendly kids, and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities, not because they were HOT like Taylor Vaugh or whatever her name was. I hate that stereotype because it doesn't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest! Also, What was so terribly heinous about Rachel Lee Cook that they would pick her over ANY other girl in the school-So what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body...her only flaw was her love for being a loner. Freddy Prinze Jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone WAYYYYYYY downhill since this movie was released. The best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when Laney walks down the stairs to Sixpence None The Richer's song KISS ME. The BIGGEST let down of this movie to me though was that Taylor won Prom Queen over Laney. Seriously, that still pisses me off to this day. The ending was just a complete and utter bomb...I wanted that skank Taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had SOME minor bad thing happen to her. She was just a horrible, snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her. Oh well, this movie is pretty lame...I will always remember it though because I saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year. Cheesy movie...Laney Boggs was robbed!!+dvd
This movie was ok, but sucked at the same time+N+I laughed a few times in this movie but was more annoyed then anything..I was left with a horrible feeling in me after the movie was over..If I wanted a downer of a ending I could just go out and watch the the different [...] that happens in the world....I waited for a long time to rent this movie, now I wish I never had rented this movie because my money I spent will go to support movies like this....What a waste of time....BBBBOOOOOOOO!!!!! All the hype was built up into a bowl of [...]....+dvd
Season 2 blazes ahead and makes Season 1 look like nothing!+P+Season 2 of this fantastic 80s detective series brings a new feel to the show.  Most notably, Murphy and Bernice Fox are gone, and replaced by Doris Roberts (now known more for playing Marie Barone on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND).  It is likely that the writers determined that Murphy was leading the show into "love triangle" territory in Season 1, and that fans just wanted Remington and Laura to be together without the complications.  At the same time, Bernice Fox seemed to serve no purpose beyond appearing at the desk whenever the lobby was shown.  So, they combined the two into Ms. Krebs, a character who could fill the role of secretary, while also occasionally appearing outside the office without posing a threat to the Steele/Holt relationship.  While Murph and Fox are missed, Doris Roberts shines in the role, especially in the later seasons.    Unfortunately, the season begins with an hour-and-a-half episode that is almost a chore to sit through. In a seeming attempt to bring to mind the James Bond feel of exotic locations, the composer even went so far as to score a theme for the action scenes that is so obviously a combination of the original Bond Theme and the melody of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. This season opener is the beginning of the "exotic locale" episodes, and increasingly over the next three seasons we would see the team travel to Mexico, Malta, Britain, Ireland . . . I never really cared for these episodes.  I preferred them staying in LA with the pretty night ligths and almost noirish atmosphere.  At any rate, things pick up in the second episode as Laura comes under personal attack so unrelenting, that it costs her a house!  A scene midway with Laura staring blankly at the burning rubble as she musters the strength to carry on is an early performance high for the fantastic Stephanie Zimbalist.    Brosnan himself would shine a few episodes later when framed for a murder he didn't commit.  This episode inroduces a recurring character who proves to be quite a foil to the pair.  Also introduced this season is the vintage Auburn automobile, which would get an entire episode devoted to its own mystery before becoming a regular fixture on the show.    All told, Season 2 manages to grow the potential of the show beyond the "mystery of the week" that was Season 1.  We really get to explore with more depth what makes both characters work - and with Murphy out of the way, Steele is free to become a little more macho and self-assured.  But do not worry - there is still enough of the slightly-bumbling Cary Grant style that makes him so lovable!  My only real complaint with this season is that the writers never really seemed to be clear on where the "relationship" between the two was headed.  They might have a major romance scene in one episode, then have NO romance for a stretch of four or five - and then suddenly be close again.  After awhile, the relationship becomes frankly boring, and the stories take center stage.    However, it is still great TV, and another well-produced DVD set for the money.  As before, the handful of 10-minute documentary shorts are spread throughout the four discs, and are nostalgiac and quick paced so as to be enjoyed without being overlong.    All told, this is a worthy set - and no, I'm not going to say it's a STEELE at any price!  That's getting old now!+dvd
Take a little THX-1138, add some Logan's Run... oh, and Michael Bay...+N+What do you get? Well, a lawsuit for plagiarism, but that isn't what I'm going to talk about here.  The Island started pretty well. Production design was great. The story was intriguing. Very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society'. I thought Michael Bay was going to surprise me. The product placement was irritating and cheesy, but I could live with it. While the writing was pretty corny, it was still nice to see Michael Bay trying something a little different for him. Something smarter. But once our heroes escape, the movie nosedives. It felt like two completely different movies were tacked together.  As I said, I was enjoying the beginning. The survivors of an unspecified "contamination" dwell within a sterile, self-contained city. Their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge. They are watched over and coddled. They have no real concerns. They live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner, which promises them a one-way trip to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth.   Once you discover The Truth, the rest of the movie degrades to non-stop car and foot chases. Explosions, shattered glass and twisted metal and lots of running and yelling fill out the last hour and a half or so.  I'm all for action movies. Loved Die Hard and many Schwarzenegger movies. It's that the over-the-top action seemed so out of place with this particular story. It seems to me that if I was the head of a company and its' future was up in the air because some damaging information was stolen, I wouldn't think that the best solution would be to send a heavily armed militia through crowded downtown Los Angeles to retrieve it. For the story that was being told, some Hitchcock style suspense would have worked much better.  Like I said, the start was promising. Then the movie switched gears. After about an hour I was just wishing the movie would end already. I've read that this is Michael Bay's best movie yet. That may be, but it sure doesn't say much for him as a director.  I've just found out that this movie was plagiarized from 'The Clonus Horror'. That one got the MST3K treatment, but I'm betting that I'll still enjoy it more than this movie+dvd
Hindsight is 20/20+N+Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.  (I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.)   Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song "Maniac" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.  So, how was it?  Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book "believe in your dreams" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.  I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.  Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since+dvd
LOVE AFFAIR - JUST ANOTHER UPDATED CLASSIC THAT DIDN'T  WORK+N+Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen "An Affair to Remember".  Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this "Love Affair" remake.  The original "Love Affair" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this "Love Affair", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of "An Affair to Remember", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.  As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of "An Affair...", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be "worthy of her love".    I don't wish to underrate or "dump" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once.  I believe they will become "old movie buffs" too.  Thanks for reading my review+dvd
I Love Gene Kelly!+P+I grew up with Gene Kelly performances and so this box set is wonderful.  "Singin' on the Rain" is one of his classics, as well as one of his best performances.  "On the Town" and "An American in Paris" are suberb too, highlighting Kelly's different strengths.  I especially liked "Anatomy of a Dancer" though because it shed light on Kelly's life that I did not know. As such I grew to respect him and his work even more. I highly recommend it for Gene Kelly followers and musical lovers alike+dvd
NOT FOR DIE-HARD FANS!!+N+If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Empire Records, DON'T buy the Re-Mixed Fan version... it's a big dissappointment.  There are added scenes in the movie, and some of the BEST lines are changed.  Example: When Rex is leaving the store and says "Why don't you all just fade away."  Yeah, he doesn't say that in this version.  I was very dissappointed when I saw this, b/c die-hard Empire fans DON'T want the best lines changed, so this really isn't a "fan re-mix" b/c it changes stuff the fans LOVE!!!  Definitely just buy the regular DVD or VHS version... it's much better as an original, not a re-mix!!!+dvd
A very good romatic comedy+P+Let me first say I think this was one of Julia Roberts best roles in a film.  And Hugh Grant plays a very low key laid back guy not without dry wit and humor.  Even though this could never happen in real life, it is a charming film.  My wife and I saw it in the theatre and own it on DVD.  This film works on several levels.  The humor and the romance with some clever writing.  Grant's unasumming casual character, William Thaker, is changed when he meets megastar Anna Scott (Roberts) in his travel book store and she is browsing through books on Turkey.  Grant, "That book is not very good if browsing turns into buying, whereas this author (holding up a different book) has actually been to Turkey."  She leaves the store and he later bumps into her on the street and spills orange juice on her, creating the need for her to change her clothing.  Grant lives just across the street.  So the romance begins.  Grant's roommate, Spike, is quite a character.  A slovenly smoker, who doesn't wash his clothes or clean up after himself.  A quirky kind of guy that ads some comedic moments to the film.  Grant's sister in the film is totally the opposite of his character.  Overally talkative, wild hair, wide eyes and they don't resemble each other.  You have to suspend belief that she could actually be his sister.  Grant's friends are believeable and quite funny at times.  When his good friend is driving through London and everyone in the car is trying to give him directions he slams on the brakes and tells them to be quiet, "James Bond never has to put up with this kind of sh**."  The musical score works quite well I believe.  I enjoy many of the songs from the CD, with the exception of "She" by Costello.  His voice is wrong for the song.  The beginning and ending scenes of the film have the song.  It would have been better to close the film with "When You Say Nothing at All" sung by Ronan Keating.  The song is used quite well in a previous scene in the same setting.  Shania Twain sings "You've got a way in the closing credits and Boyzone also contribute with an abbreviated "No Matter What" written by Andrew Lloyd Webber in the closing credits.  One of the best uses of a song is Bill Withers "Ain't No Sunshine" sung as Grant walks through scenes showing the passing of time by the change of seasons.  Very well done.  Knowing how the press hound celebrities it is difficult to believe Anna Scott, a mega film star with pictures everywhere, is not followed by papparazzi every time she leaves her London hotel and that people don't recognize her when she is with Grant in public.  I would recommend this film+dvd
Hahahaha ...  What a "deep" plot !+N+This movie is only good for those that "love" Alyssa Milano.  Plot?  It isn't non-existent.  It DOES exist but it's a complete crap!  Period.  Just an excuse to show skin.  Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions.  You won't be disappointed in that aspect+dvd
Walt Must Be Twisting In His Grave!+N+This movie is very bad, and I mean HORRIBLE. Vin Diesel cannot act! What the heck was he thinking?! Walt Disney must be twisting in his grave!! I will never see this film ever again.  The rest of the cast is disgusting, stupid, and terrible. They get dumber in every part of the movie, and a baby cries through a couple of parts of the film... and it gets very ANNOYING.  If Walt Disney were alive, he'd yell at Vin Diesel, and all the actors in this movie. And the final thing, this is not "comedy" AT ALL.  +dvd
it is still fun !!+P+Even after all the years, the show is entertaining -- not rocket science stuff but just plain fun & entertaining. The cast stay to character show to show (& season to season). While the plots aren't complicated, they allow the viewer to escape for about 25 minutes into enjoyment, & KNOWING that the good guys will triumph & live to fight another day+dvd
Best video on the market+P+If you are looking for a great video that teaches young minds simple messages of God's love, then look no further! My 5 month old daughter prefers this to Baby Einstein! Buy it! It's guaranteed!!!+dvd
Great DVD+N+My three year old loves this DVD and has discovered the joys of Goofy, BUT... Why can you just set the DVD to play all? The Mickey collection you can just set it and forget it. This collection you must keep selecting the next cartoon (it does not even default to the next cartoon). POOR SHOW DISNEY+dvd
bias media on media bias+N+starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias, the problem with this film is the same bias+dvd
moral relativism =propaganda+N+The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's  LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis+dvd
More relevant today than ever.+P+When I watch this movie it's as if the writer in 1975 had a pre-cognizance of what was going to happen in 2003. Pay particular attention to the last scene between Redford and Robertson. The words Robertson says are more relevant today that they were then. Besides meaning and relevance it's also a great action thriller, with a little romance. Faye Dunaway is at her most beautiful and Redford his most attractive. They both give truly amazing performances as ordinary people accidently caught up in monumental intrigues they know nothing of.+dvd
all right, good one then...+P+akira kurosawa's masterpiece gets the 'do-over' from criterion. this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film, absolutely no question about it. i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras, let alone watch the movie all the way through. i'm one of those frame-by-frame, shot-by-shot viewers. i have seen the film several times over the years, mostly on criterion's original release of the film, this is going way back. if you have never seen this film don't waste your time with any other version than this one. it does not disappoint. KYDU+dvd

A Parable -- Facing Death+P+** Spoiler Alert! **  By the time most people got to the theater to see this film, or rented it, they already knew the ship and its crew would be dead in less than two hours.  Surprisingly, this does not diminish from the film's power. Even on second or third viewing, the film never delivers a moment that is false, maudlin, or sentimental. The plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film. It is the issue. How do people face death?   In this film, the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know commercial fishing is a difficult and dangerous job, even when the weather is good. The weather is not good. The men need the money. They go out even though they know they will meet a storm. They are used to risking their lives every day.  The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men, and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat, they face death squarely. They talk, briefly, and unsentimentally, about things they will not be able to do, people they will miss. The stark, plainness of the acting achieves a powerful effect.  At the beginning of the film, the viewer meets the crew. On repeated viewings, the film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial. The men are solid, working people. There is no sappy foreshadowing.  The director deserves kudos for maintaining iron-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy.   The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action.  All the actors, including George Clooney, maintain a stoic engagement with life, and they struggle to live, with no appeal to our pity, until they are dead.  The Perfect Storm is more than a film. It is a parable. One could invest in such a classic work of art+dvd
Fock You!+N+This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently+dvd
Not for the Little Ones -- a review of Leapfrog 'Storybook Factory'+P+In the Product Description it says that this video is for the 3 to 6 year old age range, but having children in that range myself, I can tell you that this is incorrect.  For unlike the other Leapfrog videos, this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading, or who have just started reading.    I say this from observation of my son (3.5) and daughter (5.5) and their friends.  Those of them that are almost reading, or who are sounding out short words and sentences, understand the importance of punctuation and 'get' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally (chunking).    For the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they haven't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about.  Five Stars.  It's short, but for the right kids it's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading.  Young children will watch Lily, Tad and the gang, but don't expect them to learn much.    But buy this video.  If you have the other videos (which are amazing) go ahead and get this one to go along with them.  When the time is right, your child will just absorb this information like they did their letters+dvd
Bend it Like Beckham Scores lots of Goals with me BRILLIANT!+P+Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey. +dvd
This Is a Long Ride, Ese... Are You Ready?+P+BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT (a.k.a. "Bound by Honor") is a bit of a surprise. While it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film, it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there. For example, this film has the best location shots of East L.A. I think I've ever seen, and the whole movie has the look of authenticity. This is no illusion; the prison scenes were filmed in San Quentin, and there are only eight actors used for them.  This adds interest as you try to spot the "real" actors behind bars. (Hint: The convict who looks like Billy Bob Thornton IS Billy Bob Thornton.) Another one of the non-cons is Hispanic poet Jimmy Santiago Baca; he plays the member of La Onda with a heavily pruned mustache. Baca co-wrote this screenplay, and it's clear that he's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film. That's not to the project's detriment, but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed.   In other words, this movie's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going. Perhaps this is intentional; BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT means it's hard to get in the gang, and it's not easy bailing from it either; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie. And just like joining a gang, you're making a real commitment here, as the film is well over three hours long. (In its original form, it was well over FIVE hours long!)  SIDELIGHT: I've never heard "ese" (pronounced "ess-ay") so many times in my life; be sure to have the subtitles on to understand the Spanglish slang.+dvd
Fun fun fun!  Glad I bought it!+P+After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to give this DVD a chance.  It was the first dance workout DVD that I purchased and I'm really having a hard time finding another one that is as much fun.  (I just ordered her African/Latin one and hope it's as good!)  The biggest plus is that it keeps me interested and going back for more.  I do this workout at least twice a week and find myself feeling like I actually exercised without trying.  I HATE to exercise, so it's definitely a selling factor that I actually look forward to doing this.  If you aren't a dancer, it will be a smidgen difficult at first, but you KNOW that if you keep doing it that you'll catch on.  It's not as hopeless as some of the other ones that I bought.... and helped me discover that I've got no future in hip-hop!  MaDonna has a good personality and teaches you without you even knowing that you're learning choreography.  I learned some fun moves and my teenage relatives gave me "cool points" when I pulled out the routine while we were dancing around the livingroom :-)  I would definitely recommend this DVD+dvd
It is original+P+This movie presents a real moral dilemna..should students who have always been thought of as losers take a chance and cheat. The teacher has the toughest decision to make-weather to let his students cheat and what to do if they get caught. Jeff Daniels plays the part well-showing how he is torn-wanting his students to get recognition and wanting to teach them right from wrong. This movie has moral questions that we all face+dvd
Based On Conspiracy Theories Rather Than Historical Evidence+N+In a very convoluted plot, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou) are chased through the streets of Paris and London by the French police and a crazed religious fanatic named Silas. It's your typical Hollywood action-thriller in most respects. Yes, it's silly and unrealistic. But if that's all there were to it I might go along with the "it's only a movie" argument.   Unfortunately, this movie is also full of ideas, ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts. As an atheist, I certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in Christian history. For example, the Inquisition, the witch burnings and the Crusades are all mentioned. Yet these actual historical events are only brushed over. Instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about Christianity. For example, it states that not only were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day. They also portray a secret Catholic society that is involved in murder plots, strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities. It's completely fair to challenge the Church on its grave errors. For example, the shameful Inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people. I also disagree with the Vatican's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control. However, the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-Catholic bigotry. It's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against Jews to justify brutal acts of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust. No, I don't think it's likely that the "Da Vinci Code" will lead to the mass execution of Catholics. But any time a particular group is scapegoated it's a potential source of trouble.   Basically, "The Da Vinci Code" is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence. But, unfortunately, as P.T. Barnum said, "there's a sucker born every minute," and some people are going to believe this nonsense. History is a complex subject and I have no respect for people, whether they be the book's writer, Dan Brown, or the film's director, Ron Howard, who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck. This is garbage. Don't waste your time+dvd
Interesting short film for any Disney or animation buff+P+This is a very well done documentary that offers some insight into the rise and (currently) dramatic fall of Disney animation.    If you follow Disney news at all, the documentary does not reveal anything that you probably do not already know.  What the documentary does do, however, is put faces and personal stories to the facts.  My only complaint was that it was a little short.  It would have been nice to see what the animator's "post Disney" plans were+dvd
i love jet li's movies except this one+N+ok i love action films except this one...  the previews fooled me really badly, i thought jet li would somehow take down all the arrows like how the previews showed it...but no, he dies. that is a tragedy. if ur marketing a film and setting an expectation, make sure u meet it otherwise people get angry, like me+dvd
Murder, She Wrote: Season Three+P+It took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" - The Complete Third Season. And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher.   Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent "Syriana" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine ("The Poseidon Adventure") and Martin Balsam ("Psycho"), "Friends" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, "Brady Bunch" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and "Naked Gun" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart ("Titanic"), G.W. Bailey ("Police Academy"), Tess Harper ("Tender Mercies"), Jessica Walter ("Arrested Development"), Hayley Mills ("The Parent Trap"), Bill Macy ("Maude"), Genie Francis ("General Hospital"), Dinah Manoff ("Empty Nest"), and Harry Morgan ("M*A*S*H"). Three stars from the "Star Trek" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original "Star Trek" series), LeVar Burton ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and Kate Mulgrew ("Star Trek: Voyager"). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom "Happy Days", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled "Unfinished Business", which reunited her with "Happy Days" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of "Murder, She Wrote" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on "Murder, She Wrote" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their "Magnum P.I." roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of "Magnum P.I." (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of "Murder, She Wrote" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of "Magnum P.I." is featured as a bonus on season three of "Murder, She Wrote".   The "Magnum P.I."/"Murder, She Wrote" cross-over episodes (titled "Novel Connection" and "Magnum on Ice") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: "Death Stalks the Big Top" parts 1 and 2, "Unfinished Business", "Obituary For A Dead Anchor", "The Corpse Flew First Class", "Crossed Up", "Simon Says, Color Me Dead", "No Laughing Murder", "No Accounting For Murder", and "Murder, She Spoke".   "Murder, She Wrote" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual. I'm sure the fun will continue with season four!  +dvd
Loved this show+P+This is a must for mystery fans who love to think. It is in the league of Columbo and McMillan and Wife. Now if they will release Hardcastle and McCormick on DVD, I will be a happy person+dvd
Don't waste ur money+N+Buying this would not make sense if you A. Bought Batman The Animated Series: Volume One or B. Batman TAS The Legend Begins. If you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by Warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought BOTH A. and B. then you would have 3 Christmas' with Joker. Now I would urge you to buy Volume One and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both DVD's. Be safe and read before you buy+dvd
Vietnam Era Movie+P+This is one of my son's favorite movies and he lost the VHS tape.  This is based on a true story of a military disk jockey in Vietnam.  He doesn't follow the rules and has conflict with his disgruntled commanding officer and gets involved with the local people.  One of Robyn William's better works+dvd
Fantastic musical scores, acting production good but uneven and busy+N+Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved.+dvd
Copycat movie of the Australian movie "The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert"+N+This movie is nothing but a copy of the Australian movie "The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert".  Typical!!! Just like the original English BBC series of "The Office" which was copied and remade in the USA.  Stop stealing ideas from other countries+dvd
cool punishment scene+P+the guy shirtless, tied up, abs muscles so vulnerables to let the punisher to TORTURE this guy until he cant almost breath and cry for mercy...just an upper stomach being beaten to make this guy suffer a pain he will never forget..+dvd
Excellent workout+P+My piano teacher first introduced me to Pilates and I do some kind of pilates workout almost every day now. I absolutely love to do pilates, unlike regular exercise. (I do NOT love to exercise. NO running, no weight lifting, no biking, ect.) I never felt the need to exercise because I am small and naturally very thin, but I started to realize that even though I'm thin, I was not very strong and in terrible shape. I started to do the exercises on the beginners DVD and it was much harder than I expected. I woke up the next day with sore muscles! After a time, my abs started to get stronger and my awareness of what was going on in my body and the way I was breathing was much more alert. I also really like the alternate workout - the 'energy boost' - a fifteen minutes energy workout. It is absolutely perfect for days when I have a lot going on, or if I just don't feel like doing pilates for an hour. I can just do the quick workout, and I'm set for the day. Now I'm hooked on pilates and although I'm sad to say it is the only exercise I do, at least I'm in better shape than I was+dvd
the blood of one's brothers+P+An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine.  GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could.  True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place.   The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself.  But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die.  Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances.  Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain.  'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'.  The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves.  This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest+dvd
what horrific garbage!+N+while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo)+dvd
Making Love Scene Completely Cut+N+I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie "Making Love"+dvd
Wow! What a fun movie!+P+A fun movie all around! Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke are definately the standout stars! Eventhough it's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house! I looooove the gen X 90's feeling it has to it. It really took me back. Lalaine's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson, too. I also think that she picked the best one in the end. But, the best thing about Reality Bites is it's great filming location. H-TOWN! Makes me sooooo proud to be from here+dvd
This is not Alexander+N+Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him.  We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his "true" character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture.  No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves.       Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of Alexander.  From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the more scholarly Robin Lane Fox's "Alexander the Great" there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have.  Certainly the life of Alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film.       For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the "Battle of Chaeronea" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie.  Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer.         Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but "give me a break".  This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him "The Great".         Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless.  And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct.  And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guess work at that.  Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was intrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace.  While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted.  Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros.  He was also allowed to refered to as a "man" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a "man".       At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field.  It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving.        The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander.  A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better.  And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in "Road Runner" cartoons.  One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie:  On his march back "home", he encountered the "Mallians", a fierce and warring nation.  An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving.  Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up.  Three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him.  The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements.  The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked.  He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians.  The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there.  That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore.       Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military stratagey and tactics, a philosopher, muscian, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the "grand tradition".  Maybe Peter Jackson should make a  movie about Alexander.  I'm sure he could get it "right".                       +dvd
two good flicks+P+a previous reviewer trashed pi, why i cannot comprehend, its blend of schizoid paranoia and underground religious themes leads to an engrossing and disturbing film, well worth seeing by anyone with an interest in philosophy, psychological study, and religion. some of the acting is weak, but then again it was a low budget film so one must forgive that aspect of it. however the direction more than makes up for it..........ps his new movie requim for a dream is also a must see....+dvd
A TRIBUTE+N+A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere+dvd
Not as bad as some of these reviews say+P+I've seen all 3 Cube movies, and although this is not the best of the 3  it is a good movie.  The theory behind a hypercube (yes they exisit in mathematical theory) is accurate and suprisingly all the equations that are written out are acutal formule and equations for hypercubes.  And that adds to this movies mystique.  True the 1st movie was far better.  This movie explores more about the charactes though.  Each character had either was connected with the hypercube or was placed in it for a specific task+dvd
Pieces Of a Puzzle +N+Ju-On the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in Japan.  The movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters.  For the most part, viewers can easily be confused in the flick, or bored, as it may seem a bit redundant.  I thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory.  In practice, the movie felt never-ending, and as it drew to a close, i felt betrayed.  The movie was unfulfilled, as it never really explained a lot of questions I held at the end.  One question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a Japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers.  For those interested in Asian horror, try Tale of Two Sisters.  This Korean film has great cinematography and story line.  It will leave you on edge and taken back at its close.+dvd
Good Movie for under $3.00+N+I must say, this isn't the best of Ralph Bakshi. I bet the soundtrack would be worth more then the movie. There is some great songs, however there is no PLOT, there is no Reasoning, and there is no Action. Like Always, great animation by Bakshi, but I know for sure the Bakshi's team could had really done better. 5 stars for the music, 2 stars for the film. I wasn't upset for spending the 3 dollars+dvd
This Lady Snowblood Doesn't Fly+N+The Princess Blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie, 1973's Lady Snowblood. It's not like they try to hide that fact - it's a homage, not a rip-off. The Japanese name of both films, Shurayuki-hime, is identical, and the two main characters even have the same name, Yuki. In Japanese, "Shura" is a Buddhist term very like "Hell" or "netherworld," a place of violence and carnage. "Yuki" mean "snow" and is a common girl's name. "Hime" means "princess" or "lady." "Shurayuki-hime" is also a play on "Shirayuki-hime," the Japanese name for Snow White. All this according to the movie notes on the Lady Snowblood DVD.  In Lady Snowblood, in Meiji Japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs. After the murders, the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days. Surviving that ordeal, she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible. She offs the first one but is then captured and jailed. Dying in prison in childbirth, she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she's old enough. For what it is, this is an extraordinarily well done film. Even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we'd expect from a Seventies Japanese samurai flick, there are also moments in Lady Snowblood that are eerily beautiful.  In The Princess Blade, in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi, Yuki's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins. Betrayed by one of her own, she's also tortured for three days, but in this case doesn't survive the experience. The daughter, unaware how her mother died - she's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself. Not until she's almost 20 does she discover the gang leader is also her mother's murderer. After trying and failing to kill him, she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there.  If I may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment: I believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film, of any genre, as long as it's well done. Look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved Ghost In the Shell. The Princess Blade is low-budget, hyper-violent, Japanese chop-socky. It's well enough done that if you're already a fan of such movies, you'll probably enjoy it. However, unlike Lady Snowblood, The Princess Blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal, i.e. it just won't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film.  If you're a genre fan, I'd say of The Princess Blade, go for it. If not, and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget Japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character, I suggest passing on The Princess Blade and watching Lady Snowblood instead (now available in an absolutely superb DVD transfer, by the way). You'll enjoy the experience immensely more+dvd
In one word...   Stupid!+N+This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY+dvd
Fair To Middling Scott Western+N+Ten Wanted Men, as many of Randolph Scott's other fifties Westerns, suffers in comparison to the Budd Boetticher-directed Westerns featuring Scott. Once again, as with some of the non-Boetticher Scott films, this movie has a great cast, interesting plot features, and lots of potential, but the payoff is not as great as it should be.  Scott plays a rancher who takes in a young Mexican woman who is being relentlessly pursued by Richard Boone, who is a rancher coveting Scott's vast land holdings. Scott's generosity toward the woman gives Boone the perfect excuse to start trouble, and he hires a gang of thugs, including Leo Gordon and Lee Van Cleef, to terrorize and try to kill Scott, Scott's brother, and Scott's nephew.  Boone, who is one of the alltime great Western actors, seems out of place as a desperate cad who has to hire other men to do his dirty work. Also, this film contains many elements of Scott's other movies, and rather than seeming fond and comfortable, they seem tired and warmed over.  Scott is Scott, and that says a lot. He was often criticized for his perceived lack of acting ability, but there was a humanity and honesty about his characters that drew audiences to him then, and still works today, making him one of the most appealing American actors. But Ten Wanted Men would have been better served by Boetticher, Raoul Walsh, or another capable Western director+dvd
Yawn.+N+I saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape, so before writing my review I decided to give the DVD a chance and you know what?  The picture quality on the DVD isn't much better (if any) than the videotape and the story still sucks.  Yea, Vanity gets naked but it's done in such an unsexy way that it's well unsexy.  She looked sexier with clothes on in THE LAST DRAGON.  The story if you can call it that is about Vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend, one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together.  Soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him.  The boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two, the gorilla and the man that is, with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her.+dvd
Great classic!+P+This wonderful classic is worth watching again and again. My sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed (a pleasant surprise-since he's not hip on old movies). He thought the film would be so out of date as far as stunts, special effects, etc. that he'd be bored to tears, but this film has stood up to the test of time, perhaps because it was ahead of its time. I never get tired of watching O'Toole's performance as the brash, impressionable young Lawrence who strives to help keep Arabia in the hands of the Arabs, despite the wishes of his British commanders. At one point Lawrence develops a 'God complex', only to be brought back to the reality that he's just and ordinary man with weaknesses. This realization doesn't stop him from attempting to do something extraordinary...  Chrissy K. McVay - Autho+dvd
ONE OF THE CLASSICS+P+I see some people saying this movie was not all it was said to have been.  But you definately had to have seen this during the early 80's to relate to it and it was only meant for the people that actually lived in this time era.  For most of you seeing it for the first time in 2006, it wont make sense to you and seem outdated.  If your recollection of Hip Hop is N.W.A. or the likes, you will know nothing about this movie or relate to it in anyway - this is raw Hip Hop+dvd
Not As Great As All The Hype +N+I hear all the time as i read hip hop mags and articles all about how great Wild Style IS THE BEST HIP HOP movie ever. Well I purchased it at the first of the year and guess  what it cant't hold Beat Street and Breakin or Krush Grooves jockstrap. I think the movie Rappin or even the not so get  Lorenzo Lamas Hip Hop movie Body Rock has moments that's even better than Wild Style. People who read this will  probably say what gives you the right to think you know so much well me being 30 years old you can do the math. Thats around when the Hip Hop movement started. So if your a movie collector. Go ahead and buy it but if you want a good movie to watch. Then purchase somthing else. +dvd
The most silent of all movies!+N+Given the fact that this film has no soundtrack, I can only give it two stars. It is a bit too silent to enjoy+dvd
A Silly Sexual Farce+N+Ok! So it had a Swiss cheese plot. That's not so unusual for a soft core move is it? I've seen my share of soft porn movies and usually, not always but usually, what was lacking in a storyline was  made up by the fact, that numerous gorgeous gals were romping around in the altogether, doing stimulating things to make you forget, there was even supposed to be a plot.   Yes, Bacchanalles had a lot of nudity and a lot of make believe sex but except for the star, Joelle Coeur, who was genuinely a looker, most of the rest, looked like the girls, that get better looking at closing time. I know everybody can't always be fussy about the women they make love to, but certainly, they can be fussy about the ones they watch women make love. Right?  So what do we have? We have a plot, which, believe it of not, could have been the inspiration for "Eyes Wide Shut". Oops! I've already said too much! Bacchanalles Sexuelles, meaning `sexual festival`, features a generally unattractive cast of amateurish, stiff (not that way) actors and actresses, performing mostly sans clothing, in a fairly low budget, thirty year old erotic, French movie, with subtitles, where you sometimes have to choose between reading the subtitles, or watching the action. Still interested? Read on.   Valerie, the one bright spot in the movie, played by Joelle Coeur, who along with her friend Sophia, (Brigette De Borghese) is apartment sitting for her cousin, when Sophia, unbeknownst to Valerie is kidnapped by a sex cult. Valerie is awakened in the morning by Fred, whom Sophia apparently invited over without Valerie's knowledge. Fred forces Valerie to have sex, which she ultimately enjoys.   In the meantime The culprits realize they have kidnapped the wrong girl, for they really needed Valerie and not Sophia for their evil purposes, so the head seductress, (my expression) sends one of the cultists, pretending to be a maid, back to the apartment to garner information on Valerie, where she promptly ends up in a bathtub with Valerie and Fred before taking their ma`nage a trois to the small (double) bed in the bedroom, where the action continues for what seems like hours.  Eventually the real maid shows up and Fred and Valerie, the super sleuths (that`s sleuths as in detectives, not sluts as in ....) that they are, start to unravel the mystery of Sophia. But not until we have a half dozen more sex scenes including the grand finale, an orgy of cultists. WOW! Conclusion   I suppose this movie in a sense was an orgy. An excess of mediocrity. It also had a sense of absurdity. This may have been purposeful, which, it was would somewhat mitigate against the amateurish feeling of the film, However, that said, for all it`s weaknesses, it wasn't that bad. Like I said the story was full of holes and except for two ladies, the femmes were closer to homely than attractive, or they were hard and used looking. That said, their bodies were decent and the were enough (probably a dozen) sex scenes, that I wouldn't stop anyone from watching this bomb.   Another point should make is that being filmed over thirty years ago and in Europe, the girls were unshaved, including in some cases, under the arms. Also the color quality was a little flat.+dvd
apocolypto+P+Apocolypto is definately a violent movie. Yet, somehow, the movie would not show the brutality and the horror of the Aztec civilization if it watered down this part. Instead, this movie is very real, and in Mel Gibson's way, has a powerful message to tell. And in the final scenes of the movie, I could see how the 'want more' of the Aztec pursuing the young man could lead to corruption, and the ultimate death. This movie is shocking, but behind all the violence and gore, there is a message that anyone can see, and despite the "R" rating of this movie, this movie is definately worth watching. I thought it was extremely well done+dvd
A BIG disappointment+N+I was hoping that the 2nd season would be an improvement from the 1st season, but sadly it is not.  I am a major batman fan and grew up on Batman: The Animated Series, Batman/Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond, and Justice League.  The previous cartoons had great scripts and in depth charactors that made it exciting to watch....I am finding that I am going off topic.  The batman is not the cartoon for die hard fans of batman over the age of 3.  The show is written for a much younger audience that does not need a captivating script and deep charactors.  Instead this show focuses on the action sequences and way too many witty comebacks.    I have to say this, but what the heck is the Penguin doing when he is fighting batman?  Has he traveled the world and studied numerous martial arts?  Since when can he jump from tree branch to tree branch and swing around and kick batman+dvd
Don't waste your money+N+This DVD is a huge waste of money.  The whole thing is poorly put together: bad music and worse girls.  Just take a look at what the cover offers -- one word, BUSTED.  The first two Hip Hop Honeys DVDs justified their purchase ... this one sucks+dvd
The War of the Roses+P+I enjoyed The War of the Roses, so much so I loaned my DVD to someone and was waiting for it to be returned so that I could watch it again.  Excellent movie+dvd
Shallow characters, bizarre story+N+That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!  On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it+dvd
problem with ordering+N+I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.    If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version+dvd
Forgotten Anderson gem+P+Joe 90 is, to American viewers, one of Gerry Anderson's best-kept secrets, as, apart from two made-for-cable episode compilations that aired in the early 80s, it has never been broadcast in the USA. This is a shame as this series contains some of the best model work of the entire Supermarionation canon. The series is pure fantasy -- just think what the DYFS would do if it found out that a nine-year-old adopted child were acting as a &quot;most special agent,&quot; carrying a gun, driving tanks full of explosives, etc.The series is a great deal of fun, and the attention to detail is quite frankly amazing. If one were to watch the series from a distance, one could easily be forgiven in thinking that it has real actors in actual normal-sized sets. Although contemporary publicity material claims the series is set about 50 years in the future, ie in 2038, the fashions, vehicles, etc. are firmly from the 1960s, and easily stands up to the best that British television from this era had to offer. Just ignore the fact that the main protagonist is about 2 feet tall and you'll find the series highly enjoyable.Oh, and it's got a super theme tune, and the remastering is, as George Orwell might say, double-plus-excellent. Carlton in the UK has removed practically every flaw in the original prints. They are pristine, and look superb on my 32&quot; TV+dvd
Pure dookey.+N+I want my 78 minutes back! Spare yourself - don't buy this cruddy film, and don't waste your time watching it.  Think of all the wonderful things you could do in 78 minutes.  Call me old fashioned, but I have this little hang up about a movie having a plot and having structure.  This is a desperate attempt to be artsy, which simply comes off as a bunch of film students fooling around trying to do something weird.  Endless repeated scenes with small variations, a "mystery" that really isn't much of one.  Courtney Cox wearing awful clothes and ugly glasses and endless closeups of her looking gaunt and haggard to the point where I wanted to offer her a sandwich or something.  Dreary acting, dreary music.  Creakingly obvious attempts to be artistic by shooting portions of the film in bilious green or dreary blue.  The same material recycled endlessly to the point where I hated all the characters, and didn't give a damn what happened to any of them.  Making a film without a single likeable character is a big boo-boo.  If the audience doesn't care, they might not hang around until the end, and if they do, they'll feel as if they've wasted their time.  As Hannibal Lecter would say, tedious, very tedious+dvd
i don't get it+P+I don't understand. How is it that so many people thought 1984 the movie was a masterpiece and yet they didn't give this great film the time of day. This movie is as good as 1984 (the movie) was bad. This is a perfect example of what communism really is, a good idea that could only work in a perfect world because hay, people (and animals apparently) are corrupt. Theirs a reason they say absolute power corrupts absolutely. People are selfish, and this is why communism must always fail, because people don't like to share and like being forced to share even less.  This is one hell of a movie. Not perfect, but way above the [...] fest of a movie 1984 was. If you love Gorge Orwell than get this movie      +dvd
zhang yimou+N+Rating - 5 stars for the film, of course, but zero stars for the copy. Thank you so much for the information on the new editions of Ju Dou, Qui Ju.  (Razor).  I have cancelled my order.  I will keep reading your commments and continue my search for these films (Red Sorgum also).  And will let you know if I find anything.

New line from the Criterion Collection!+P+As a film programmer & movie fan, I'm VERY psyched about the new Eclipse line from the Criterion Collection. What better start than these early titles by Bergman. It looks like more great things to come, so keep your eye out. Even without the many extras, etc, the Eclipse catalog will finally make available many rare films that have been waiting for DVD release. Thank you, Criterion+dvd
A great film given the basest possible DVD treatment from Fox Lorber+N+Most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning Srdjan Dragojevic film at select film festivals in the U.S. have not forgotten its clarity, its anger, and its power.  The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber.  This DVD is a bust in every thinkable way, although Fox Lorber was obviously aiming very low.  The phrase "bare-bones" is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary, dismissive releases, lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant.  This DVD does contain a trailer, but the trailer, sadly, looks better than the feature.  "Bare-bones" would have been fine, but watching this disc is torture.  It's obviously a quickie transfer from the VHS -- I could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout, poor audio balance (with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo) poor contrast, a muddy, dark image, burnt-in subtitles, and so forth.  Fox Lorber were long the scourge of the art-film DVD market, and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc.  New Yorker and Wellspring (formerly Winstar) are guilty of similar offenses+dvd
Excellent Service+P+Item was shipped as soon as i placed order. I was updated often. Excellent service+dvd
Ingratiating Comedy Focuses on a Circle of Vacationing Married Friends+P+Twenty-five years since its initial release, this 1981 comedy from Alan Alda, its director, writer and nominal star, still holds up pretty well. In fact, I just saw Norman Jewison's 2001 film, "Dinner with Friends", which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age. Using Vivaldi's familiar string concertos as a transitional device, Alda's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season, consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year. It's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax, but it all seems to fit the contours of the story.  Jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends, while his wife Kate, a magazine editor, is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with Jack's constant emotional insulation. Danny is a neurotic, penny-pinching dentist married to Claudia, an artist with the hot temper of her Italian roots. Nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife Anne, a housewife frozen by her self-doubts. It is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends. The group starts out with a spring fishing trip when Nick confides to Jack about his need for a divorce, followed by a Caribbean summer boat trip when Nick brings his new nubile girlfriend Ginny, a wide-eyed stewardess. The fall has them visiting their kids in college, and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to Ginny much to the chagrin of the wives. The last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged, especially as Ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics.  The acting is solid. Alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as Jack, and a wisely cast Carol Burnett is actually pretty subtle as Kate. These two were such huge TV icons in the 1970's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant. As the most comic pair, Rita Moreno and Jack Weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like Fred and Ethel Mertz redux. Broadway actor Len Cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free, while Sandy Dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected Anne. Bess Armstrong plays Ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance. The story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that Ginny will become more integral to the group, but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty. Alda doesn't quite have Woody Allen's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition, but the film generates a good time while it lasts. The 2005 DVD has no extras+dvd
Strange Movie....+N+Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish! Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it+dvd
Stargate SG-1 series+P+This is the best Sci-fi series ever.  I am a huge fan of the gate.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I already have the first few seasons in the old packaging, and if I want my sets to match I am going to have to sell them and re-buy them in the new thin packs.  But with the price break now, It's definately more affordable.  Plus it will be nice to have a set half the size!!!  I can use the room+dvd
Karl Rove Would Be Proud+N+So I finally got around to watching "Michael Moore Hates America", the DVD that was financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, with the help of a few right-wing think tanks. Also appearing is Penn Jillette, a rabid psychiatrist, some NRA staffers, pundits, more think-tankers, and a number of pissed-off vets.  While Wilson comes off as tolerant (backhandedly) with regards to Moore's techniques, when it comes to his ideas it's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man's social commentary. There's a lot of well-balanced, average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess, but the number of instances that hint that maybe, just maybe Moore's got a few points in his films (as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context) are exceedingly few.  Center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation, so the movie caters to them very well. By far most of the examples criticized here involve Bowling For Columbine, with only a few from "Roger And Me" and none from "Fahrenheit 911" although the movie was released. In one scene Wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw "Fahrenheit" the day before: "How would knowing that Mr. Moore's selective editing of the facts in Fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film?"  On a social level, the film is a veritable ode to Republican framing, i.e.: There Is No Economic Divide, Corporations Don't Hurt Us, We Can All Be Successful If We Work Hard Enough, Criticizing the Leadership means you Hate America, etc., etc... and oh yeah, one actually guy goes on to say that we don't need Michael Moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media, amazingly lumping present-day Fox, CNN and pre-merger CBS-era Walter Cronkite together in the same sentence.  Ultimately, the man (Michael Wilson) fails to get his interview.+dvd

Top TV Film!+P+The truth shall set you free...might be a more apt title for this little 'made for TV' gem in which Jim Carrey stars in one of his first roles.  'Doing Time on Maple Drive' is a powerful drama about one family's cathartic acceptance of the truths which threaten to destroy it.  On the surface, the Carters are the epitome of the 'perfect' suburban family.  Three handsome children, neatly trimmed front lawn, the flag waving outside.  The all-American family.  The first scenes tell everything.  While the Stars and Stripes hang outside the front door, Lisa Carter (Bibi Besch) polishes the family pictures as if they were sacred relics, masks of a happiness that is conspicuously absent from this family.  Lisa sets the table for the arrival of their youngest son, Matt (William Mc Namara) and his bride-to-be, Allison (Lori Laughlin).  Next scene and father (James Sikking) pulls up the driveway with his eldest son, Tim.   The black sheep of the family, Tim is just there as a sad reminder of what he 'could have been.'  He could have gone to West Point if he hadn't flunked out, if had he just done what his father had wanted him to do.  And now, he is the household ghost, symbol of failure, burden to his parents.  Ignored, he takes to the bottle which further alienates him from his family.  His father won't even let him pass through the front door lest mom smell the stench of alcohol.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  The Carters are masters at seeing what they want to see.  Denied the successful son with Tim, they place all hopes on Matt. Young and handsome, he soon plans to marry his Yale sweetheart, Allison and walk into the role of perfect child, fulfilling the wishes of his parents.  And somewhat pushed to the back is the daughter, Karen (Jayne Brook).  Married and theoretically 'free' from her family, she is still prisoner to her father's expectations, rather than partner to her journalist husband.  He wants a child, but she's afraid her father might not approve.  The film reaches its climax with skill and tension.  And the clues that something is amiss are everywhere.  Why isn't Tim going to be best man at Matt's wedding?  And why isn't Matt's best friend from Yale being invited to the wedding?  Smiles are forced, subjects are avoided and nobody listens to one another, until the outsider, Allison, refuses to join the game.  By chance, she finds a love-letter from Matt addressed to his university friend,Kyle, the one strangely missing from their wedding's guest list.  Not only is Matt forced to acknowledge who he is, he has to explain to his family why his bride-to-be has suddenly called off the wedding. Matt tries to escape this confrontation by nearly killing himself.  Surviving the car crash, he still has to survive the even more painful crash with his family.  Will the Carters survive the shattering of their wall of forced smiles, family photos, and lies?  'Doing Time on Maple Drive' does a wonderful job of dissecting the so-called 'dysfunctional family.'  The perfomances are tight and convincing all across the board, especially those of William McNamara and James B. Sikking. Their father-son relationship is portrayed with power and tenderness. Carrey's performance is also tops, proving just how versatile an actor he is. My favorite though was Lori Loughlin. She managed to play the part of star-struck lover thrown a hard one brilliantly.  She's fascinating to watch as she starts to doubt Matt's honesty and is forced into a truly painful decision.  Ken Olin's film is a must for those of us who know the Carter's dilemma first hand. Cathartic and instructive, 'Doing Time on Maple Drive' leaves you with a guarded optimism, an affirmation that the truth can not only set us free but keep us together as well.   +dvd
Bogart's  Final Film+P+The Harder they Fall is a hard hitting expose of the boxing racket, and a racket it is. Excellent performances by Humphrey Bogart, as a Sportwriter turned Boxing Press Agent,Rod Steiger, Edward Andrews, Nehemiah Persoff, and the always great ( and underrated ) Jan Sterling. An Excellent Screenplay by Philip Yordan, from a Budd Schulberg Novel. Mark Robson's Direction is swift.   ***** Stars+dvd
A fabulous THE NUTCRACKER production+P+I hate ballet.  It is so boring, and I start craving dialogue after about twenty minutes.  All that dancing gets so monotonous!  So it was startling to watch Emilio Ardolino's film version of George Balanchine's THE NUTCRACKER (1993) on videocassette and just adore it.  The sets and costumes, by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, use color to perfection.  The Tschaikovsky music is glorious.  And the dancing, by the New York Ballet, is outstanding.  I could even follow the story with just Susan Cooper's minimal narrative read by Kevin Kline.  It is a great ensemble cast, and Macauley Culkin fits in nicely as the Nutcracker Prince.  Bart Robinson Cook as Godfather Drosselmeier is magnificent, and newcomer Jessica Lynn Cohen is enchanting as Marie.    I clearly don't have a lot of experience in stage NUTCRACKER's, or any live ballet.  A NUTCRACKER expert may pan it for something.  Leonard Maltin asininely called it "much too stagey"!  Leonard, they call it filmed ballet!  Of course, it is stagey!  And this 1993 production is as good as ballet gets for me.  As someone at NEWSWEEK says on the front of the videocassette box, this is "like having the best seats anyone ever had for THE NUTCRACKER."  It is an enthralling plum pudding of a Christmas present for viewers of all ages, especially dance lovers. +dvd

This Is What Great Looks Like+P+From the original Steinbeck story to the Horton Foote screen adaptation to the lush cinematography and amazing performances, Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is film perfection.  There is a terrible sense of inevitability present from the very beginning of this film; we know that fate will not be kind to Lennie.  But despite his slow march to tragedy we are transfixed by the elegant simplicity of the telling.  Sinise uses his knowledge of theatre to pare this classic story to the bone.  Malkovich, always willing to get lost in a part no matter how bizarre or extreme, doesn't act Lennie, he inhabits him.  Watching his childlike behavior and listening to his repetitive monologues we understand completely why George loves him as he does and simultaneously finds him thoroughly maddening.  Malkovich owns this role for all time, I feel badly for every actor attempting it from now on.  Extreme roles, like Lennie, allow actors lots of room to show off while simultaneously providing margin for error.  Sinise, as George, has the hardest duty and comes through with a quiet performance that is nothing short of stunning.  Every aspect of his complex relationship with Lennie is revealed almost inadvertently, hope, bitterness, anger, protectiveness, and pride to name just a few.  As director he has stitched together all the elements of this film into an organic whole, no false notes.  As director directing himself he simply inserts his own performance into a complete vision, his embodiment of George is generous - not self-serving.  The brilliance of Malkovich and Sinise should not obscure a host of wonderful supporting performances.  Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) is excellent, Joe Morton is terrific as always, Casey Siemaszko brings real malevolence as only he can, John Terry is thoroughly believable as a crew boss, and Sherilyn Fenn is exactly on point as the player who loses control of the game.  Simply put, Of Mice And Men is what happens on those rare occasions when absolutely everything goes right.  +dvd
Really good movie+P+While I am not a Richard Gere fan, I have to say this is a really good movie.  A loving wife has an affiar with a french stranger.  Her husband eventually finds out and has his revenge, but only for a moment until he has realized what he has done. Now he must decided to come clean, or just pretend it did not happen. The bulk of the movie is the affair and all the places and ways she cheats.  But a good movie, Diane Lane, and Olivier Martenez make it very watchable+dvd
lack of the depth and profoundness of those original 26 movies+N+what made the original 26 zatoishi movies as one of the best creations in japanese movie history was its profoundness, the depth of a blind wandering swordsman, often lonely but inevitably beloved by some beautiful young women, usually giving you a helpless, melancholy, nostalgic romantic broken dream. the original zatoishi movies were also having the integrity of solid screenplays, fantastic directing, wonderful settings, perfect supporting performance, amazing fighting scenes and sequences, seamlessly perfected editings....from the first two black and white ones to the other 24 colored ones, none of them was never seriously produced. and best of all, shintaro played the zatoishi role almost seamlessly perfect that oscar or any other kind of film festivals would suffice enough to honor him.  i just don't know and don't see why and how this new addition would be necessary in any way. why suddenly the great zatoishi blind swordman became an overly ruthless, heartless, and cunning mobster, a  stereotyped trademark of an vicious yakuza killer instead of guardian angel of the helpless common people? so bloody and so pointlessly gory gross? it's a quite hollow and shallow one if compares to those originals. yes, the movie industry's technique maybe more modern, but if we failed to deliver a better and newer version and interpretation of this great legend and character in japanese samurai genre, we better not, shall we say: you don't need add crawling feet to a snake when trying to make a snake look more alive. it's totally unnecessary+dvd
The alternative would've been to make more of the same.+P+A lot of fans of series 1 through 6 would say series 7 & 8 are a travesty, or that they are a letdown.  I suppose that would make me one of the solitary voices of opposition.  The way I see it, 7 & 8 are simply the natural progression of the show.  Even around series 6, I've noticed that the same tired old jokes were being run into the ground, particularly in regards to Cat's nose/sniff gags, one-liners about dead fashions, and Kryten's sudden and unexplainable lapses back into his inability to call Rimmer a "smeghead" (Smeeee-heeee!).  I don't know how the diehard fans abide it, but for me, it got a little old.  Starting with series 7, there's a bit more drama involved, and not such a disregard for the lack of continuity.  The cliffhanger at the end of series 8 leaves you wanting, but as it's now approaching 10 years since, I wouldn't hold out hopes for another series.  Don't be surprised if that's all, folks+dvd
My two year old enjoys it quite a bit...+P+This is my two year olds first Bob the Builder.  He has generally only wanted to watch a Baby Mozart and nothing else, but the first time he watched it, he was hooked.  He would sit there and nothing could distract him.    He really enjoys the opening song of Bob the Builder, but he does get a little bored toward the end of the show.  With that said, the first 20 minutes are gold for him as he really enjoys it.  This is not too bad for us adults either except for Lofty who is always whiny and tough to listen to, but it is a nice little show.  He would give the show 2 thumbs up!  We will be trying some additional Bob the Builder dvds+dvd
Great movie ...+N+... ruined by bad dubbing.  Unfortunately there is there is nothing in the Amazon listing or even on the DVD case indicating that this is dubbed.  A nasty trick to play on buyers who prefer the original language+dvd
90% of VIDEO DOES NOT MATCH MUSIC.+N+The very Best of the DJ Tiesto REAL LIVE Show is the amazing synchronization  between the music and the show (lights, fireworks, etc.) This DVD is TOTALLY unsync; and doesn't make justice to the real thing. The real thing is just amazing. The DVD version is just BAD; VERY BAD. More than disappointed I hate the moment when I made my decision to bought this DVD. REALY BAD !!+dvd
Thought provoking, well-written, sensual (all of these and more) +P+One of the best romantic comedies EVER!   It is a WONDERFUL movie! +dvd
one more chopped film is now in the pipe+N+We have a new victim in the vecinity. Unwelcome! Title: see above. A small, juicy, masterpiece by Jack Ford has been cut from the original 1,33:1 format to 1,85:1. We are left only with the small consolation to deplore it. More: we have been deprieved of the real product for HOW LONG?. Shame+dvd
WHY WHY?+P+So I finished watching season 5 and let me tell you there are no words to describe how good the dialogue, the action, and the story arc was. Please give this show a chance you will not regret it. Yes, season 1 was slow but that's how it is usually. Afterwards, the show continues to grow. Season 5 is probably my favorite because of Spike and the storyline. I was pretty sad about FRED. Wesley is such an amazing character who becomes his own person on Angel. I love what they did to him. This was worth all my money. Please someone tell me a show out there rite now that beats Angel and Buffy. I mean the writing was sooo good this season how could WB even think to cancel this show? Now we will never see Angel again...BOOO WB!+dvd
these muthas crazy!+P+the dvd is one of the best in my collection.  it shows you how thes cats are really like off camera.  these are some real brothas.  bizzy is the craziest little dude.  there could have been more live performances.  they should have put the "crossroads" performed live at the mtv music awards on here instead of the one they put on.  other than that this dvd is of tha chain.  get this.  all bone fans need to have this+dvd
Not all that good.+N+Not a huge fan of James Cagney or gangster movies, and nothing about White Heat has changed that opinion.  Lame plot, corny dialogue, and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing.  In it's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that Hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades.  Hardly what I would consider to be a classic+dvd
Lover's Lane......another horrible wannabe slasher movie to add to the pile+N+Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the "Hook Man" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous+dvd
Reincarnation+N+I'd seen Shimizu's "The grudge" and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film.   It's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said, it's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days. The trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie.   The special FX are probably better than other stuff I've seen recently in b-type movies.  Bottom line, I was expecting much more out of this+dvd
for all j-horror fans ^_^+P+this is probably i think the THIRD in the j-horror series being realeased by LGF by the creater of INFECTION & PREMONITION. good continuation of the series so far. think of it like THE TWILIGHT ZONE type of movie series. plus for trailers of this fine movie you can visit.  [...+dvd
Horrible quality.+N+IF you are looking for a set of W.C. Fields shorts or films, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SET. I made the mistake of buying this set and I am thoroughly unhappy with the shoddy quality of this set. I filed a complaint with the manufacturers of this set, Passport Video, and they have refused to refund me. So do not buy any of their merchandise as their "no refund" policy seems to be an across the board business practice with them. Save your money and buy a quality film like "The Bank Dick," or "It's a Gift.+dvd
[2.5]--Cheese-la-Weez What Happen Here?+N+As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.  This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.   Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking.+dvd
Action+P+This movie was packed full of action and very well configured fighting. Jet Li did a wonderful acting and fighting job as always+dvd
2 Stars For Poor Quality DVD. Great Movie.+N+I have read in another review that the "John Wayne Collection" edition of this DVD is of poor picture quality. I have the "Collector's Eddition", and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well. This is a great movie, a classic. It was filmed beautifully in Ireland and deserves better then this. I hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves+dvd
ANOTHER MOB HIT...+P+This is simply a great mob movie. Based upon the best selling book, "Wiseguy", by Nicholas Pileggi, it traces the rise and fall of "gansta" wannabe turned government informant, Henry Hill. Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses. Named 1990's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, and National Society of Film Critics, it garnered six Academy Award nominations and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  In the 1950s, a preteen Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) began his career as a "gansta" wannabe on the mean streets of East New York, where a small Italian American community thrived. Working with Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino's) crew, he worked his way up, doing the penny ante, gofer stuff, until he began more heavy duty involvement. As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water. He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted. His wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), also became entranced by the perks available to a mobster  Henry teamed up with Jimmy "The Gent" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Together they stole, lied, cheated, and killed their way through life, until they got wacked or got caught. When Henry, against the express advice of Paul Cicero, got involved with Jimmy in the 1970s cocaine drug trade, it was the beginning of the end for him and Jimmy. The film skillfully chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill from wiseguy to goverment informant in the witness protection program..  It is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes. He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters. Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives. He clearly enjoys all the perks of a mobster, his only regret being that he could never be a "made" guy, because he was not fully Italian, as his mother was Sicilian but his father was Irish.  Robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful. Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being. He is a guy who does not think twice about killing someone over something trivial. Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way. Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life. She is sensational.  This is simply a great mob movie. It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again. I, myself , have seen it at least three or four times, and each time is as if it were the first. Vastly entertaining, this film is a worthy addition to one's collection+dvd
Not Even Worth It At These Prices+N+I wasted my money to watch CdeB 1.) try but fail to carry a full concert with only himself 2.)  see the camera repeatedly zero in on a touched fan in the audience...who happens to be part of CdeB's marketing organization  3.)  try to convince everyone that he irons his own shirts and is not a rich snob.  Chris DeBurgh, I'm a fan of your music and lyrics, please stop cheating your fans out of their money for sub-standard products as this one...  Now I know why it was so affordable...but you dont even get what you pay for on this one..+dvd
FABULOUS!+P+This is a terrific period piece.  Characters are well developed, cinematography is great, and story is fine.  Well worth the price+dvd
WHAT!!!!!!+N+I kept watching this hoping a plot would eventually come up. But it didnt .+dvd
Nothing new, but isn't that the point+P+Every now and then we sould honor the memory of Morse and John Thaw. Inspector Lewis does that plus it brings some closure to the other key character. So the author of this screen play is no Colin Dexter and reverted to remaking Hamlet - at least it is admitted in the dialog itself. Very predictable plot twists and well crafted ending. All in all, 5 stars if you're into Morse. Skip it if you aren't+dvd
Well I Really Liked It!  +P+The movie is similar to Crash.  It is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration, emigration and racial mixing among modern day Czechs.  The performances are expertly acted and very moving.  I love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to "adopt" a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home.  It seems when it comes to having a son, color doesn't really matter all that much, even to a committed Ayran! +dvd
Two hours of misery among losers+N+For me, my low rating of this film might be, at least in part, the result of having wrong expectations about it.   I had heard this film described as 'charming' and 'funny,' and was expected a comedy, albeit a somewhat black one. But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth.   It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story.+dvd
Classic Sixties Movie Magic!+P+Two for The Road is a true sixties comedydrama in every sense of the word. It is also one of the best roadmovies up to date. It is a funny, dramatic and an absolute pleasure to watch that will stay in your mind for some time.  Starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn and the funny Albert Finney, the story follows a married couple who's flame of relationship has burnt out. The marriage is on the rocks while flashbacks show how their relationship began while both were travelling through Europe.  The director, Stanley Donen (who also directed Hepburn in Funny Face (1956) and in Charade (1963)) has made a film that is a true masterpiece. The way the movie is cut and edited is absolutely fasenating and makes the film very great to watch. You will be swinging around from one situation to the next in absolute joy. The characters are great, the situations fun and the romance is delicious. Next to those comedic moments there is also a chunk of drama in the film. It fits perfectly and doesn't feel like it is unnecessary next to the comedy, which is another element that makes the film wortwhile to take a look at. The film is ballanced just fine and isn't hanging too much in one direction.       Considering artdirection the movie is true eyecandy. Beautiful, colorful locations are seen throughout the film with an even more beautiful Audrey Hepburn. This film made her the true fashion icon of the sixties. She is prefectly dressed in every single scene and made women all over the world want to be like her even more. Her acting is once again grand, you just can't go wrong with Hepburn. You'll be charmed and enchanted by her looks, personality and that big shiney smile. Albert Finney plays Hepburn's husband, a fun role. He acts great and makes you love him or hate him in the various situations. He is believable even though he is pushing his performance to the beginning of  being unbelievable, which brings great fun to watch and a memorable performance.  The music of the famous Henri Manchini (Breakfast at Tiffany's, Charade, The Pink Panter) is beautiful and fits the film perfectly. Emotions are made stronger, situations are made funnier and even more romantic then they already are by this fasenating soundtrack. The main theme will be playing in your mind for some time after seeying this film.   So the film is a true enjoyment for both eye and ear. It entertains you, wether by the story, locations, music, that lovely Audrey Hepburn or that funny Albert Finney. It wants you to travel with them and long to the sixties.  Two for the Road is a masterpiece that will leave you with that smile on your face that you want to have when looking for entertainment.        +dvd
Warriors of the Vatican+P+This is based on the book VAMPIRE$ by John Steakley.  James Woods is a cynical vampire hunter and leads a team sanctioned by the Vatican.  But after a job in the Southwest things go wrong.  Suddenly a vampire shows up who is immensely powerful and knows Woods by name.  In just moments the vampire slaughters everyone present, slayers, cops, prostitutes.  Only those who were not there survived.  To make matters worse, the Monsignor in charge of the slayers has arrived from the Vatican and wishes to meet with Woods.  Woods is introduced to a new priest for the team and told to assemble and train a new team.  But Woods is ticked off and wants to know how a vampire can be so powerful and also knows his name.  Woods does not follow his orders.  Instead he tries to track down the vampire.  It seems this is the original vampire; the one who spawned the rest.  The vampire was created during a botched exorcism and seeks to perform a new ritual that will make him even more powerful and eliminate some of his weaknesses.  Woods has little time to find the vampire and put a stop to him.  Woods also has to put up with team members who are in grave danger of turning into vampires themselves.  Armed with guts, a hatred of vampires, and some modern weaponry Woods is all that stands between the world and total domination by vampire.  This is a James Woods movie pure and simple.  Sure, it has vampires, action, and women, but it is Woods that makes the movie.  His character is wonderful.  You have to  wonder at how desperate the Vatican is for slayers to even tolerate Woods let alone employ him.  The slaying techniques are different, efficient, and very sensible.  All in all a pretty fun movie with James Woods at his absolute best.  Fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly will probably get a kick out of the score which seems to have inspired the music in Firefly.  Check it out+dvd
Great cartoons, bad DVD+N+I'm impressed that Disney is comming to their senses and putting out this old vintage stuff on DVD, I remember this series from when I was a young kid, I originally said in the review for "Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers" that these DVD's are not worth it because I only liked the theme song but now I changed my mind. The animation is superb, the story is wonderful, and some of the characters(Cubbi and Sunni) are cute!  I'm not happy because all they had on the DVD were episiodes of the TV series only no bonus features whatsoever, not even interviews with the original voice actors, I know bill Scott is dead but June Foary is still around along with corey burton.  Disney this is still your property please treat it with respect!+dvd
HARRYHAUSEN TAKES THE TORCH FROM O'BRIEN WITH THESE CLASSICS!+P+If I think of a Cyclops, there is only one that comes to mind(I know there were two in this movie). It is the Cyclops in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. If I think of a fire breathing Dragon, it is from this great movie I see the definative Dragon! Ray Harryhausen has created so many incredible creatures it is amazing that there are some people out there that just don't know what they are missing. The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is another classic included in this set. The least of the three movies included in this set is Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, it is a good installment showing what a master craftsmen Harryhausen had become! The DVD set has great transfers and some nice extras. This is essential Harryhausen.+dvd
Dreary, hard to watch.  +N+Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...   To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.   Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.  +dvd
The Long Journey of an Artist+P+Andrei Rublyov (1969) by Andrei Tarkovsky is my number 1 (shares with Tarkovsky's Zerkalo) film of all time. It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it.There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time.   Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power.   The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, "The Bell" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the "swiftest birds" of pain and death can't reach you...  +dvd
Another Nicolas Roeg Train Wreck!+N+There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it+dvd
Low budget porn.+N+The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it.  Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video.  Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind.  He is the only reason for watching this film.  Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood.  I warn you that this film is not very good.  Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film.  The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward.  If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him.  Otherwise, discard the rest of the film.  This film is really not suitable for people of any age+dvd
Highly recommended.+P+For those who enjoyed "Road Home" here comes another wonderful version of an emotional film involving teachers. In this case the story is developing around the first love of an innocent village girl and the newly arrived teacher. In this mixture of sad and happy moments we can enjoy the innocence and purity of a young girl who discovers love for the first time, the effort of a teacher to remain impartial and fair as a teacher towards a girl that he started liking too. The involvement in the story of other teachers and people around their daily life, adds interest and emotion. Soon the viewer is part of the story. The photography is magnificent and the music typical of the 60s. This wonderful selection of music is also a centerpiece in the development of the story. A very well balanced film, running smoothly and keeping the viewer interested, full of emotion, throughout the entire duration. Highly recommended. +dvd
B Is For aBominaBle+N+Or how about B is for, "An R Rated scooBy Doo"? Yes, it's really that silly.  Funny thing about Abominable is that I was actually entertained. But was it a good movie? The idea of providing potential viewers/purchasers of this movie with a customer review is to help them decide whether or not the movie is worthy of purchase, right? Or let's just say that a review here is to determine whether or not you should even rent/view.  I gave Abominable 2 stars. Then why...after I just said I was entertained by Abominable...would I only give it 2 stars? Well, it's this dilemma I've been having with trying to fairly rate movies in order "to be helpful". What I mean is, in the genre:  Aliens would be 5 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 5 star movie comparatively? No way.  The Descent would be 4 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 4 star movie comparatively? No way.  Slither would be 3 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 3 star movie comparatively? No way.  I am left with an entertaining movie that doesn't compare to the aforementioned. Hence, I can (fairly) only give Abominable 2 stars, right?  Look, according to Amazon a 2 star rating means, "I didn't like it". But that's not really true. It was okay. It started good and went quickly into the spiraling vortex of a silly, continuity-issue, B-acted, made-for-TV Horror flick.  So go for it if you're compelled to watch a movie about Big Foot gone wild with the classic deaths of those that break the "Scream" rules of what you're not supposed to do in a Horror movie (complete with gratuitous nudity) in order to stay alive. Abominable is not quite as bad as the 2-star "I didn't like it" rating that I donned it with. But it sure ain't no 3-star Slither.  It's a 2006 made for TV B-movie.  B is for snow joB.      +dvd
Schlock, not Shock+N+This is an unbelievably bad film. Its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer Gary Ridgeway's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film's tawdry, fictionalized action scenes. I hadn't known this footage of Gary Ridgeway existed. A documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie.  The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a "tall, handsome, muscular" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway.  If you want a better insight into the character of Ridgeway's victims and crimes, read Ann Rule's book, "Green River, Running Red." In any case, avoid this movie mess. +dvd
The book is better.+N+This film is based on one of my favourite books, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. Despite great performances by Blanchett and Fienes, it just doesn't hold together well. Too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight. The characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing. The book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not. There is also an ending tacked on that doesn't exist in the book, and that always annoys me. I was very disappointed. I think had I not read the book, I'd have stopped watching the movie about 1/3 into it+dvd
IT'S IN LETTERBOX, and it's good+P+It's old, and so many of the people have died, but it's a great documentary.    It's also in letterbox, unlike what Amazon is stating it being in a pan-and-scan state.  mik+dvd
Well above average southern horror drama is worthy of any TV series collection+P+`American Gothic', a TV series, is a supernatural drama consisting of 22 episodes, some of which where not aired during the original run. It ran on CBS for one year between 1995 and 1996. Its creator Sam Raimi had already worked on southern horror projects such as `Evil Dead I & II' and would later go on to direct the southern horror thriller `The Gift' before breaking box office records with his `Spider-man' series success. Southern horror is nothing new as Stephen King attests using some of his best works as an example, such as `The Stand'. We also have the `Children of the Corn' series (nobody said all southern horror was great), the works of David Lynch and `Frailty' to name a few of what is a whole DVD section unto itself. Apart from the modern `Carnivale' TV series it is hard to find southern horror outside of some `X Files' or `Twilight Zone' episodes. The most obvious parallel though is to Lynch and `Twin Peaks', and for those who enjoyed Peaks, then Gothic offers a slightly less satisfying but equally as interesting plot type.  Gothic is about the town of Trinity, Deep South southern Carolina, that is home to what seems to be the devil himself in the guise of Sheriff Lucas Buck, who in the view of his deputies has never done an honest days police work in his life. Buck is creating illegitimate sons in order to sire his successor. Caleb Temple, an orphan, finds himself caught between his murdered sister's ghost pleas for revenge while a plot is hatched by Buck to turn Caleb to the dark side. Caleb's cousin, Gail Emory and local doctor Matt Crower, are determined to ensure that Caleb doesn't fall into the clutches of Buck's psychopathic fatherly lessons. The scene is set for explosive tension between this world and the next.  American Gothic was aired out of the directors intended sequence by the instances of CBS who also refused to air some episodes.  The episodes "Echo of Your Last Goodbye" and "Strangler" where not aired. "Potato Boy" and "Ring of Fire" were aired out of sequence. This same inconsistent sequence is presented in the DVD box set. For this reason you need to know the intended viewing order before you watch the DVD. The intended viewing is - "Pilot", "A Tree Grows in Trinity", "Eye of the Beholder", "Damned if You Don't", "Potato Boy", "Dead to the World", "Meet the Beetles", "Strong Arm of the Law", "To Hell and Back", "The Beast Within", "Rebirth", "Ring of Fire", "Resurrector", "Inhumanitas", "The Plague Sower", "Doctor Death Takes a Holiday", "Learning to Crawl", "Echo of Your Last Goodbye", "Strangler", "Triangle", "The Buck Stops Here" and "Requiem".   Compared to Peaks, Gothic is far more supernatural and slowly burned its way to a specific cult following that didn't generate any ground breaking ratings. A second season of Gothic did not appear, however when other stations aired Gothic in its intended order the ratings improved. The DVD series is also very popular. There are many reasons to believe that Gothic could have been made for extra seasons (what produ$er would not?) as there are some loose ends, but that is not to say that American Gothic does not stand alone as this mini-series, it does and it can. The only real onion is that one of the leads Dr. Crow (Jake Weber) left the show, or was written out, only a few episodes from the end. Apart from these minor production drawbacks American Gothic builds slowly but gains a lot of momentum towards the concluding episodes for a mind-blowing supernatural Abrahamic type finale on a staircase. If you like a good supernatural TV series and if you like originality with some of the best wit ever scripted and some serious dead pan sarcasm every split second, then look no further. And for those who boil at `CBS butchery' they can now own all of the Gothic episodes and watch it in the order it was meant to be viewed+dvd
awesome+P+This DVD collection is a must if you are a fan of D&D.  It is the perfect additon to add to your 80s video collection to remember your childhood days that are long past+dvd
Fans Rejoice! Good buy for new and "true blue" fans alike!+P+FREEDOM FIGHTERS FOREVER!  The short review: Way Past Cool! If you're a fan of the series you have to have this DVD collection!  The long review:   EPISODES For anyone who's had to stand watching cut or badly recorded episodes from TV, I can't express how good it feels to watch these in clear stereo with no tracking lines and perfect picture. I can even see the paintbrush strokes in the background art it's so clear! So far as I can tell, everything has been restitched back together wonderfully and I can see no weird edits. It's just like I remember in Ben Hurst's words "fresh - like watching it for the first time!"   BONUS FEATURES A few people have complained about the lack of bonus features, but I can't say good enough about them. The series was produced 10 years ago, since then most if not all of the artwork in the vaults has been lost, sold online (I've seen a number of cels pass by there) or locked away. The fact they managed to find even a small amount of high-quality artwork makes it well worth the trouble. I too wish there was more, but the stuff they did find is very good. I believe there are really only two bits of the extended/deleted scenes that are truly new material but it's all well archived and the one silent animatic has the script super-scripted in so it's easy to follow. The concept art is beautiful, there are a few new model/expression sheets in the interview with Hurst and tons of background art that will blow you away. This is the same quality one would expect in feature post production work. Both of the interviews are engaging, enlightening and even a little tearful at times, especially Ben's moving speech about Season 3 and his support for the fans. Considering how hard the crew at FUS has worked to get this DVD, they deserve it. The DVD menus themselves are a blast -- I have seen a number of poorly produced menus with "craptastic" art in them and these blow me away. They are thoughtful and even funny! In one part Snively hits the "Bonus Features" button. It's the little things like that which show the effort and care they put into making the DVD.  BOX ART Okay so some of the artists who contributed art are very young and aren't what you would call "good artists". But to me, it's refreshing to see a company that actually WANTED and ACCEPTED input from the fan base. It shows that we are all united together as fans of Sonic, no matter what our background is. You can tell each of the artists was excited and trying their best to make something to show how much they love the show. I go as far to say a few of these artists ARE exceptional, some of them even drawing "on-model" as we in the animation business say. Ken Penders (while not really a fan per se since he's worked professionally on Sonic Artwork) did a pretty good job with the cover, as it did include most of the cast and it doesn't show anything that isn't there (Thank Goodness his arms aren't blue either :D). Compared to the first test cover, this final one is much better. Dr. Robotnik is the best part of the cover, he's very well drawn.  ANYTHING ELSE? Just so you know where I'm coming from, I was prime age when SATAM came out, being 10 at the time, and it is a big reason I am who I am today and certainly a reason why I'm going into the animation industry. That being said I can't express enough why it's important to support this release. They did a fantastic job. And I think it's worth buying this for any Sonic fan, especially if you know someone who likes Sonic X --   In Sonic's words, "Get ready to rock, cause this will knock your socks off!" :)  If you're new to Sonic and like this series, I highly recommend checking out Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic Underground as well (the other two shows produced by DiC, the predecessor to SATAM and it's later cousin, respectively.) A lot of fans would say otherwise but I just can't get enough of the blue blur!   - Joanie /^+dvd
inspirational+P+as a theology student, as a citizen, and as a human being the movie touched me at every level. the transformation story of archbishop romero is not only about an individual hero but touches upon what it means for a church to have a human face. what role a church must play when caught between politics and violence. it is relevant to us today as we face a new global hegemony. the people around the world are being exploited in the name of capitalism and democracy. while, we, the fat americans stand by and watch in indifference the people suffering? some 2 billion people who makes less than a $1/day. will we rise up? will we open our eyes and to see the plight of the majority of humanity outside the boundaries of united states? who will speak for them? who will hear their cries?  may i be as courageous as archbishop romero in speaking the truth and to confront the systems of power and indifference.+dvd
"Out of my way, Dildo...!"+P+Despite the fact that it was slapped with an X rating, Flesh Gordon is really a Spoof of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s... most notably Flash Gordon.  In fact if you saw the old Flash Gordon serials you'll really find the film funny...  The humor is basically Kentucky Fried Movie and Groove Tube type camp...   funny almost "Rocky Horror-esque" lines, and over the top scenarios.   - - The film is most interesting because the low budget special effects are pretty good (the FX team seems to take up half the credits and one of them went on to DIRECT the THE HELLS HAVE EYES), yet at the same time it is definitely a NUDIE of that era... (the flip side is that it has enough plot, content and dialogue that you could edit it all out and it would still be funny.)  In the end, I'm really surprized that this campy  CULT CLASSIC isn't one of the all time movie nerd favorites... it is genuinely funny and tasteless from the get go to the big finale !  *as a funny side note aside from a really cool and groovy tune featuring some Jazzy fender Rhodes, there's an... organ scene featuring some really nifty and gospelly  Hammond Organ... the guy is *really* playing the pedals and playing the chords like you rarely get to hear these days +dvd
Disappointing...+N+This is baed on one of 4 Novels that Sir Conan Doyle wrote in his Sherlock Holmes series.  Since the book has a lot of details and a lot of exposition that can really go wrong in a feature film length movie, I had expected that a reasonable change & corresponding adaptation were made to translate this into a movie.  Alas!  The constant mediocre suspense throughout the movie added on by Sherlock Holmes' very rude attitude toward Miss. Morstan were appalling.  The book says that Sherlock Holmes said "state your case" in a brisk manner.  "Brisk" is nothing close to being rude in its meaning of the word.  Dr. Watson in numerous accounts describes Sherlock Holmes as having a gentleness towards women.  He may not express any fondness for women but was chivalrous nonetheless.  Granted the character of Sherlock Holmes is not an easy one to portray for any actors, and so far Jeremy Brett captures it the best.  However, this one was surely disappointing.  Holmes' keen nature and energy was well demonstrated but his good professional mannerism was surely lacking & compromised.  I blame the script more than the actors really.  This adapation just doesn't capture the tone & flow of the original book.  I highly recommend short story adaptations like Adventures of Sherlock Holmes & the Return of Sherlock Holmes series in Granada Series intead of any feature length installment.  Short story adaptations were much better than feature length ones+dvd
Great to Learn about Yuppies+N+I should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey plays one thing well - the smarmy yuppie.  Having grown up in a working class Manhattan family, I know the type well.  He does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again.  This film is no exception.  The worst thing about this movie is that even though I only watched about 2/3, I had to use grease-cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime. +dvd
Preview it before you show it.+N+I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans+dvd
An excellent fourth series+P+This series is in my opinion, better than the previous three seasons as the pace is quicker and there are more jokes per minute. The writers were at a creative peak by this point and the show hit its highest ratings in America.  The episode - til death do we volley - is an excellent example of how great this season was, it is hilarious from start to finish and full of funny twists.  The times when Rose begins to tell a St Olaf story are often met by much more bitchiness that before and you can see how each character's personality has been developed since the show started.  I ordered this DVD for use in the UK as unfortunately no more series are being released in Europe due to poor sales of the previous three. I found that it played fine in my multi-region DVD player, and came with better packaging too+dvd
a propaganda film gone wrong.+N+This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.  The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.  The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.  This film has significance, but is not a good one+dvd
Price of DVD+N+Are you sure this is not a misprint?  Who in their right mind would pay $114.00 for a DVD?+dvd
Okay for a low budget gun flick+N+This movie is okay if you like low budget gangsta movies without any plot. People compare this movie to City of God and I have to wonder what they've been smoking. This movie is just like any of the other straight to Dvd movies starring a rappper except its about Jamacans in Miam+dvd
One of the funniest DVD's ever+P+I have to admit being a New Yorker I have never have had to live with knowing my team would never win the big one and instead would always lose in the most crushing ways possible. But this DVD had me cracking up the whole way through. Its amazing to watch these fans live for a team that cannot ever get over the hump. But towards the end I started feeling really bad for all these people. Cause you could see the anguish in their eyes, and in their faces. This team really means a lot to them. The fact that it is the brass ring (in this case winning a World Series) none of them will ever be able to grab left me feeling bad for them. Having said that I still laughed about as hard as I ever have at a DVD. My Dad, and I have watched it several times and we still laugh like crazy+dvd
My cat, Tippy, loves this!!+P+I have had different cat videos and DVD's over the years and usually my cat, Tippy, gets bored after a day or two.  I have had this DVD for two months and Tippy still watches it regularly.  Also, there is a loop feature.  the other day I left the DVD on the loop feature and it kept Tippy entertained while I left for work.  I highly recommend this DVD if you love your cat+dvd
Captives+N+I have seen Julia Ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress. This is not one of them. Senseless subject. The audio is bad, or the language is not what I am used with, so I understood only half of what they said in the movie. Stay away from this one+dvd
This Is Great.+P+I am so glad that I ordered this DVD. I recently bought a Knifty Knitter set from Herschners online store and a couple of books here on Amazon on how to use them. While the books aren't that confusing, this video cleared up a lot of questions. It was great to see the priojects done in first person view. They are very easy to follow. :) The DVD gave me a better understanding of what was being done on the loom. I can now follow the books prett easily. Thanks+dvd
Waited this long for Widescreen and No FULL Extended Version+N+Unbelievable. I mean come on, we're only talkin about a few minutes here.  Missing some of the funniest scenes in the 1st movie including the German Jacque Cousteau character scene.  I didnt even know the laserdisc version was an 'extended' version until now.  Thank god I still have the laserdisc.  Another incident of movie companies raping the public.  Grrrrrh..+dvd
So disappointed+N+I didn't think I'd miss the Christopher Reeve superman movies (one and two at least) and I really miss George Reeves now!!!!  Those black and white Superman shows were the best!  what's her name was a HORRIBLE Lois Lane!!!!  The whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row!  I don't even care about the deleted scenes!  I want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - I'm going to give this one away!  Brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull!!   I remember now that my brother told me I could wait for cable.  I got greedy - someone bought him a DVD that was coded for another country (there was russian writing on it) and it wouldn't work in my DVD player so I got Amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in Brooklyn.  I SHOULDA WAITED FOR CABLE+dvd
Good Pictures, Very bad Story.+N+For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to "believe". The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. Why the story is so weak? First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite.  Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie.   +dvd
Cold War Fun+P+I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended  getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun+dvd
There's a good chance you'll hate this movie.+P+If you're anything like 80% of the folks in the theater when I saw this film, you'll probably start rolling your eyes, exhaling loudly, and moaning about 1/3 in. With that said, I thought it was fantastic. The Fountain is flawed, for sure, in its pacing and its grandiosity, but what you get in return for patience is a very thoughtful and gorgeous experience. It's clear that Aronofsky really loved this project. Other reviewers hsve said that this isn't so much a movie, but a work of art, and while I'm a bit hesitant, I agree.  Don't expect Requiem for a Dream. Don't expect a "thrill ride". Just watch it when you have the time/headspace to devote to it, and you'll feel something, one way or the other.  *The soundtrack, by the way, is nearly as beautiful as the film itself. Definitely to be checked out+dvd
Movie for the Un-intelligent...?+N+This movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor.  Are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny?  Sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society.  I'm not a stiff when it comes to humor, but I trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with Fox.  Fox Network is a base for right-wing Republican stupidity.  This movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities.  I think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of American humor have gone.  Hurray for the 1st amendments and others our Four Fathers came up with, I think they were brillant men.  I am all for Free-Speech but I believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public.  This film definitely over stepped its boundaries.  For all those people who loved this movie...why are there sooooo many (around 180) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago!?!?!  I thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto...Just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents+dvd
A pilates routine to grow and lean with..+P+I've taken live pilates lessons in class and one-on-one setting.  Due to cost/transportation restraints, I wanted to keep up the progress I was seeing in my abs/core (that no length or amount of sustained crunches ever gave me).  I tried many and learned from many instructors via dvd, but once I got to Hilary's dvd-I realized I found the 'one' who could both instruct and inspire most like a live instruction setting.  Her method is not commercialized, but personalized in its relaxed setting yet still true to the philosophy of Joseph Pilates without being too highbrow for a groggy early morning or weary late evening. In 30 minutes, you will cover a number of the standard Pilates movements without losing focus on quality of movement over quantity. She's very easy to spend time with. At the end of the workout, I'm lightly sweating, stretched out, abs worked and feeling very feminine and strong.. get it.  I hope you make the same and more progress than I have+dvd
Sam has done much better+N+Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed+dvd
Propaganda, but very well done.+P+Dziga Vertov's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema (I say this with some reservations -- see below).  The viewer is quite literally transported to the Soviet Union of the past.  We witness love and loss, happiness and sadness, life and death.  We witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day, a wedding and a divorce, a birth and a funeral.  All the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth, the funeral a real funeral, the divorce a real divorce.  Nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people. The music is quite inventive and amazing, especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it.  The editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of Soviet silent cinema. That said, there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity, that those who follow the Party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible.  So many people are shocked by Nazi propaganda films such as "Triumph of the Will," -- I find it sad that more people are not troubled by Soviet era films which tout the beauty of Marxist-Leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide (i.e. the Ukranians)carried out by the Soviets for over seventy years.  The fact of the matter is that Soviet Marxist-Leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others.  This is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking+dvd
good idea, bad movie+N+I thought the idea of Phone Booth was great, but the movie is just bad.  Maybe Hitchcock or Welles could have pulled it off, but this is just plain sad.  Skip it+dvd
Grande Damage+P+Imagine you are walking through a great art museum, overwhelmed by one massive canvas after another.  In your rapture you almost walk right past a tiny painting in the corner, an unassuming, faultless Vermeer.  That is this movie.  Watch it on its own terms, in its own time, and you will certainly love it.  Ladies In Lavender is a star vehicle for two British Grande Dames, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith - that's hard to beat for star power.  (Indeed, the only thing missing in this movie is Helen Mirren.)  Almost everything except the plot fuels the story, the plot is so small it would be easily lost in the garden these sisters keep.  Place is massively important, and brilliantly recreated.  Pace is massively important; these people lead simple, slow lives.  Most of all, emotional nuance drives the bus here, Maggie Smith can say more with a furrowed brow than any ten Hollywood actors with a well-polished script.  The film invites adult viewers to take an adult look at the many different forms love takes, and their consequences.  From the bitter and cynical aging doctor, to the painfully vulnerable and naive Ursula, Dench, to the cool yet kind Janet, Smith, this film weaves leitmotifs with such a deft hand you barely notice.  The young man, Andrea, is played adequately by Daniel Bruhl, while Olga, young, manipulative, and ambitious, is the girl everyone loves to hate because she seems to have it all.  Olga is played by Natascha McElhone.  Ms. McElhone is fortunate to have been blessed with model-esque good looks; if you look carefully you can see her being out-acted by a footstool, a washstand, and a pair of knitting needles.  Those who enjoy metaphor and symbolism will not have to meditate overly long before realizing that the love these aging sisters bestow on their innocent foundling is a give and take proposition.  Ultimately they commit the greatest act of selflessness any person can, they must free their "child" and let him live.  (Irony here since they are what used to be charmingly referred to as "barren.")  In so doing, they allow a great talent to bloom - sharing it with the world.  This brings us to the film's other star, Joshua Bell.  Bell provides the actual violin virtuosity behind the scenes, and his technique and range are chilling - from barn dance sawing rowdy enough to set the Strad on fire, to subtle trills that could make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Yes+dvd
IT IS HARD TO GET MUCH LAMER THAN - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story+N+This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again.  Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut.  This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will.  Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart.  This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls.  Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book.  That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever.  Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods.  Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings.  Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had.  Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order.  Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality.  In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice.  Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work.  I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way.  When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.)  This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story.  If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit+dvd
Friday the 13th Part 7, The New Blood+N+In "Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood," we get to hear a narrator tell us the backstory. I don't know who the narrator is; the credits don't mention him. It sounds like Donald Sutherland, but I bet it's not.  Mr. Narrator reminds us of what has happened to this point in the saga, ending with the fact that at the end of Part 6, Jason was weighted down and drowned in Crystal Lake. Mr. Narrator informs us that "people forget he's down there."  This is just stupid. A man responsible for nearly 100 murders in the space of 10 years does not just disappear from public memory. Furthermore, when Tommy Jarvis drowned the bastard in Part 6, surely the cops and scientists would have then retrieved him, picked him apart, and studied him. His hockey mask would be on eBay. There would be an A&E "Biography" episode about him. People don't just "forget he's down there."  But the forgetting is necessary for the story to move forward. It will be helpful if you, the viewer, have forgotten a few things, too. For example, remember how in Part 6, Crystal Lake changed its name to Forest Green in order to escape its bloody past? Yeah, go ahead and forget that, because it's Crystal Lake again now.  After Mr. Narrator spins his yarn, there's a prologue (which takes place on Friday the 13th -- CREEEE-PY!) in which a little girl who looks like the "Poltergeist" little girl accidentally uses her psychic powers to kill her dad. Surely we all have made errors like this at some point in our lives. It occurs outside the family's house on Crystal Lake, mere feet from where Jason is chained to the lake bottom, "forgotten" by the locals.  Next thing you know, it's several years later. The little girl is grown up and named Tina, and she and her Markie Post lookalike mother have returned to the cabin after apparently having been gone awhile. They've returned because Tina's weird psychic/telekinetic abilities have made her a bit freakish, and a psychiatrist named Dr. Crews wants to "help" her, which really means he wants to use her power for his own gain. (Dr. Crews, by the way, is played by Terry Kiser, who also played the corpse in "Weekend at Bernie's." This is an actor whose career consists only of low points.)  So while he's trying to get Tina to harness her powers, Tina goes out on the dock and tries to use them to summon back her dead father. Instead, she accidentally summons Jason; whoops! He gets right to work and starts killing teen-agers, who are conveniently located in an adjacent cabin, having a surprise party for someone who doesn't show up because Jason has killed him. It makes you wonder what Jason would do if he were revived on a weekend when no one was anywhere near Crystal Lake. Would he bother hiking into town to kill some folks in a diner? Catch a Greyhound to the next major city? Or just hang out in the woods, waiting for someone to show up?  The interesting thing about this movie is that it was directed by John Carl Buechler, whose credits also include "Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College."  The second interesting thing about this movie is that it features the return of the unsettling Daisy Duke shorts that men in the 1980s apparently wore ALL THE TIME, if the "Friday the 13th" movies are to be believed.  The third interesting thing about this movie is that at last, there is something different to do about Jason. In the past, victims have battled him by running, stumbling, and screaming a lot. Usually they give up pretty easily and just let themselves be killed, often because they want out of the movie. But now we have Tina, whose telekinetic powers are far more effective than mere knives or screaming. Good to see someone putting a little effort into things.  Goodness knows the writer, director and actors didn't expend much effort. We won't bother mentioning that the acting and dialogue are atrocious, like they always are. If we don't mention it, maybe you'll forget.+dvd
Not impressed - A Big Disappointment+N+This dvd barely worked and didn't do any good. This might be good if your potty training a boy. It is very boy oriented. They need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls. How can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training, they are not the same+dvd
Amazing movie!+P+I first saw this movie on the Family Channel several years ago and fell in love with it!  What a great, light hearted, and fun movie!  This is  "clean" romantic, fun movie to watch.  Great actors too!  This is one you will want to watch over and over again+dvd
The REAL Secret!+P+Sandra Magsamen is neither a New Age prophet of personal enrichment nor a Martha Stewart, but both of these types should listen to what she has to say. What she says in this PBS DVD is that we can bring joy to others and strengthen our bonds with others by doing simple, creative things in our everyday lives. The idea seems obvious once you get it (like The Secret), but unlike The Secret, Sandra's message is about GIVING TO OTHERS, and not getting "everything you have ever wanted."   Not only is this the real secret to leading a happy life, but it revolves around practical things you can do that really work.  You decide: Visualize a Mercedes, or learn how to make your next family gathering a joyful experience+dvd
Gangsta King+N+Given the subject matter, one could hardly expect a high budget production but what Gangsta King delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick.  Understandably Greg "Batman" Davis is seeking to portray Raymond Washington in a favorable light but putting it out that Raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far.  Contrary to legend, the crips were violent from day one as were the L.A. gangs which pre-dated their emergence.  The most interesting thing about this documentary is Batman's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library.  The historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video.  Low budget, low quality, low class+dvd
Smartly funny+P+I don't write reviews, and I don't purhase movies but I'm doing both for this one.  What a great movie. In a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor, this movie is smart, fast, clever and unexpectedly expected. Enough said. Rent or buy this movie. Watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again. Get a kleenex because you'll laugh so hard you'll cry.+dvd
Yes, this is really boring+N+I agree with rigg_vienna. This film is one of the worst of all Agatha Christie movies. The version of 1981 with Sir Peter Ustinov is MUCH better, and not to forget such great actors like Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith or James Mason. If you want "Evil under the sun", forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981+dvd
memorable orientalia wasted on poor film stock!+N+Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a  more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in  pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are  generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively  substandard.  Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner  is a  glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic.  Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was  the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a &quot;highly  acclaimed&quot; work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third  time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be  likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of  creeping glaucoma.  Village of Dreams is so &quot;relaxed&quot; as if the  filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they  enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the  straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions  were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking  whom.  The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer  is the poor film  stock. The picture approximates that of a &quot;third generation&quot;  recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of  having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy  which was copied from the original VHS &quot;master tape&quot;.  Of course,  the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite  their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that  could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring  deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high  resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and  in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If  not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as  wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because  I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for  world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away  gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well  as negating its  &quot;collectability&quot; factor. This should have looked more glorious if  it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like  What Dreams  May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those  editing-challenged Japanese filmakers.  I want to ask Amazon for a refund  because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it  because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically  glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure  production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with  BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit  thoughtful, films....+dvd
Criterion Collection Stunk!+N+The above entitled collection was a real disappointment. Not at all what I expected and definitely not worth the money. Quite frankly, I was so disappointed I threw them in the trash. I know there has to be good W.C. Fields films out there, however W.C. Fields: 6 Short Films-Criterion Collection is not one of them  Bill William+dvd
The movie is good but the dvd sucks.+N+This is a good movie, but the DVD works like a cheap bootleg. My DVD player   was fresh out the box and for some odd reason this DVD kept skipping parts of the movie.  +dvd
It's a Classic and great for ALL!!!!!!+P+You can't help but love this classic.  With the garbage that comes out of Hollywood today it's nice to know there are still safe films available for families with values on DVD from yester-year! Should be a Christmas Classic+dvd
Great+P+As swift as I'd expect to come from the US and is of a fine quality+dvd
enjoyable, but frankly my dear, id rather be in secaucus+P+i managed to miss this: one of those generational impact movies, and never caught up to it until now. it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were NOT cliches when this movie was released, but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all 8 stars. and of course there IS that soundtrack. still, the movie ripped off "the return of the secaucus 7", and tho i havent seen that in a long time, my guess is id prefer it on a more core level+dvd
The ads proudly state "From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie". Need another reason not to see it?+N+The writers of this movie thought that referencing dozens of different movies would make a comedy. No. There has to be jokes, funny jokes. There needs to be something humorously said about the original films to make it a satire. I have seen many of the films this movie "spoofs" including Napoleon Dynamite, When Harry Met Sally, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, The Wedding Planner, Jerry Maguire, Sleepless in Seattle, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and ALL of them are funnier than Date Movie. It really is pointless to spoof comedies. The writers don't even reference date movies all the time. They reference King Kong, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and it doesn't work. Even the so-so Scary Movie films have something to say about the films they are spoofing. Not only was it terribly unfunny, it was sick. I like Monty Python and American Pie but when a cat starts humping a decayed human torso I draw the line. The writers of this film also made Epic Movie. I saw Date Movie on DVD. I will not see Epic Movie ever or any other film made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. It is a sad time in our world and an extremely small part of that sadness is the fact that movies like these are made and make millions at the box office+dvd
Historically---but not comically---significant Chaplin+N+This 1914 film is considered the first feature-lenth comedy ever made and, as such, is worth viewing just for that.  The film on its merits, however, is less interesting. Sure, this is slapstick, but I personally found the Tillie character to be quite ridiculous; ridiulous, moreover, without being particularly amusing. She's made up to look like---and seemingly acts like---a guy in drag pledging a fraternity.  Marie Dressler, then 45 years-old, playing such a supposedly youthful character as "Tillie", to boot, is less comical than it is distracting.  If you are going to take the time to see this film, in other words, you ought be doing so simply to see a historically significant film.  So, no, it's not a film you'll most likely want to own and watch again and again, unless you're simply enamored by anything and everything Chaplin has done. If you haven't seen anything by Chaplin don't start here! And if you are a discerning Chaplin fan you'd be better served (if you care to be amused) by sampling some of his much greater efforts.  For the curious, I offer a brief synopsis of Tillie's Punctured Romance: "What's this he's got---one of Ringling's elephants?"  So remarks Mabel Normand's character (so to speak, in this silent film) as she spies Chaplin's 'City Guy' arm in arm with "Built like a battleship" Tillie.  Tillie has "got a bankroll as thick as herself", Chaplin's character later explains to Normand, his old partner in crime.  Then once successful in lifting said cash from Tillie, Chaplin flees with Normand.  Upon hearing of Tillie's apparent inheritance of 3 million dollars soon after, however, he returns to her and begs Tillie to marry him ASAP.  They later whoop it up with many quests (with Normand working as hired help) at a celebratory party at Tillies's "new" home, until her uncle---thought dead---returns to claim it back, throwing them out into the street as he does so.  A keystone-cops-like chase ensues all through town and seaside along a boardwalk and then ends with Normand and (a soaking wet) Tillie agreeing that Chaplin's favor is hardly worth pursuing anyway. Curtain. Cheers!+dvd
bogged down+N+Liz Hurley has her top off 4 or 5 times; there is incest, lesbian love between sisters-in-law, the main character's husband is having an affair with his brother's girlfriend who really isn't his brother's girlfriend, she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother's girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a "solved incorrectly" murder from 125 years ago on an island with some Norwegian people. And honest to god the movie is boring. Sean Penn broods, leers, pains, and smokes cigarettes, his wife is played by Catherine McCormack who is like a young Charolette Rampling, very watchable but condemned to a weak role;  Liz Hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off (unforgettable): All this and the movie drags, and drags. Liz stops taking her top off at the 1/3 mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is.  The parallel stories just don't come off. Actually it is a one star movie, Liz taking her top off boots it one extra star+dvd
really beautiful!!!+P+I love doing this set because I feel really beautiful after doing it.Guess I also look more beautiful with a huge smile on my face and the confidence I have+dvd
Tomcats: Brilliance Below the Imbecility.+P+While ostensibly the worst movie of the 21st century,  this paean to masculinity has pushed the feminist movement up by 30 years. How? By exulting in the lowest common denominator of male attributes. Imbecilic jokes abound to entertaining the male masses who must make up the majority of this film's viewers. However, below the surface is brilliance, undercovered only by a select group of cinematic geniuses. To the select few, this film is actually a stark examination of depravity: we are asked to observe B-grade actors be pushed increasingly lower into the depths. We explore what is NOT on the screen, such as the awkward human feeling behind the scenes. One can only imagine the director yelling "Tomcats, Scene 5, Act 4! ACTION!," as Horatio Sanz is asked for the fourteenth time to tell a (...) joke.  Thus, if you want to see phallus jokes and dispense high-fives, watch the film. If you want to see a brilliant dissertation of human depravity, check it out.+dvd
The Party+N+The DVD played semi relevant sub titles (in english) randomly throughout.  We were unable to remove them. Absolutly sub-standard.+dvd
Didn't come with that cover+P+Well we know about this movie for more than 20 years that is one of the best. But Amazon has a photo on cover that does not exist+dvd
Still a rookie+N+Richard Pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian.  I consider him the best in the business.  But his performance in  &quot;Live and Smokin&quot; shows he's still just a rookie.  He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material   is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;Here and Now&quot;+dvd
Extremely Disappointing+N+I love Eddie Murphy, and I loved Dr. Doolittle!  The previews of Dr. D II looked so funny, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, I just saw it, and my mind has still not recovered.  Dr. Doolittle 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it.  The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer.  To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it.  Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not.  The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer.  His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear.  And talk about long.  This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain.  And the other animals!  A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear.  When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge.  A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights.  Murphy actually acquieses.  What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable.  It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film.  It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them+dvd
GREATEST MOVIE EVER+P+THIS IS THE BEST FILM I"VE SEEN IN MY LIFE. I HOPE THERE"S A PREQUAL. I HAVE IT ON 9 DVDS. ITS BRILLIANT+dvd
They should have an alternate beginning where Orlando Bloom does kill himself+N+Orlando Bloom tries to act too cute by trying to channel the karma of Johnny Depp, and it just does not work.  Kirsten Dunst basically just acts cute throughout the whole movie.  So, if you like movies about two cute people acting cute, then this movie is for you. +dvd
The Man Who Would Be King +P+This is one of the best Adventure films I have ever seen. Wonderous, full of Humor and Action. Great performances of Sean Connery and Michael Caine. And all that before the Golden Age of special (computer generated) effects. A masterpiece which I never tire of seeing. And every time the ending makes me feel a bit sad and feeling sorry for Daniel and Peachy. They deserve better. +dvd

Wes Craven: Man of Mystery and Movies+P+Wes Craven, the man who has written, directed, produced, or edited more than 30 television and feature films such as &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, and the recent &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy, is finally revealed here in the popular &quot;The Directors&quot; series. Wes speaks highly and thoroughly about the making of his films, but keeps quiet about his personal life which he has always done and I respect. Though, it is very informative about his feature films, this DVD neglects to mention almost none of his television work like the new &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; of the 80's and his short lived &quot;Nightmare Cafe&quot; series. Any fans of &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot; will be sorley disappointed as they pretty much mention the title then move onto &quot;Wes Craven's New Nightmare.&quot; What can you expect, they had to squeeze 15 films into one hour. Other than that the DVD is great. Wes Craven fans should check it out+dvd
what a classic, glad i own it+P+this is one of those great and rare movies from the 80'S that you  cannot find in any video stores. i know there is some person out there saying " well who wants to rent it" to often to many times we get caught up in our own generation with our own music,movies and all the new things that technology has put out there to even give a movie a chance from a different era. i collect alot of movies and have tried to collect ones i watched when i was growing up such as TOURIST TRAP, CURTAINS., AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE. Today there are a lot of movies being remade like The Amityville horror and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre please do yourself a favor and watch these movies that were first made and copied so poorly also give the actors from the original movies a chance such as james brolin,marilyn burns and gunnar hansen as leatherface these are true and serious actors they really had to act, todays stars are usually standing in front of a green screen. i have to admit i do own some of the remakes but there will always only be the originals first. thanks yvonne and steiger you rule+dvd
Great acting, but by the end you won't care for any of the three protagonists+N+I came to this page struggling with how to encapsulate my take on 'Dying Gaul,' but I see that amazon reviewer Josh Lanyon has nailed it perfectly:  "The actors were brilliant and the thing is so beautifully shot--the music, mood, the little touches--all great. And all rather beside the point."  Exactly.  Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard are all spectacular here.  I thought Scott was the standout.  And, the movie looks incredible.  But the dark mood of the movie got darker and darker...and simply less likable.  By the end, you won't care for any of the three protagonists.  I watched the movie with two other people.  None of us liked the ending...nor did it matter by that point.  We just wanted it to end.  We were intrigued by the presence of an 'alternate ending' on the DVD.  It's basically the same ending, but it goes on a bit longer and only confirms that the ambiguity of the released ending was intended (one character expresses the ambiguity in a voice over)+dvd
Corregidor+N+As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the  period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer it for sale is unbeleivable +dvd
Uneven quality, but still excellent+P+I was disappointed in the quality of some of the episodes in this collection. They looked as though someone had skipped over them during the digital cleanup for DVD. A tad washed out. Other than that, it was outstanding. I'd recommend it to anyone+dvd
Funny and different+P+If Mel Brooks was into old Kung Fu movies instead of old Westerns, this would be the result.+dvd
Hillarious+P+Very Funny. My dad gave me this for my birthday,and I laughed my but off. It was kind of depressing since he was a raging alcholoic, but in the end,  that is what makes hime the most fuinny. Cheap and a classic+dvd
Terrible!!!+N+Terrible movie... I really like Denzel Washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing... he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right+dvd
Pretty Good Flick+P+The single shot camera action in the beginning is a bit nauseating, but it adds to the affect of the storyline very well.  Simply done and well acted.  This one's worth seeing just figuring out the story.  Graphically realistic situation that can happen to anyone. +dvd
Total TRASH! Don't even think about wasting your money!!+N+The 1st "movie": Fist of Fear, Touch of Death is so bad I didn't even watch the next 2. The uninitiated will possibly not know that the footage that purports to be about Bruce's life,  family and ancestry is all rubbish and was actually taken from 2 different movies: The ancestors "cuts" in color are from a colossally poor period piece that would be funny if it didn't seem to be taking itself seriously. While the black and white parents-and-family "cuts" actually are truly a young Bruce in a Hong Kong film that he made before returning to the U.S. to live. However the scenario is totally misrepresented. All of the other participants are actors as well and not correctly identified. Nor is the dubbed dialog related to what is really being spoken (in Cantonese) by the actors. Yet a third source is tapped for the "supposed interviews" which are not with the speaker at all, but with someone else regarding the work Bruce did on the "Longstreet" TV show in '71 and once again the voice-over not only is not really Bruce and is again, not accurate (and he was speaking English during those interviews). One would be better served to buy the "Legend" DVD from the -Bruce Lee Master Collection- or the more recent "Bruce Lee: The Warrior's Journey" to see and hear in Bruce's own words and voice what the NON-"What's Up Tiger-Lily" version is of the early Hong Kong (black and white) and what the "Longstreet" interviews have to reveal about him.  If this is meant to be a spoof and they just forgot to mention that anywhere, then shame on them. I don't find it even remotely humorous, not to consider the generations of people who might not know any better since his untimely death 32 years ago.  +dvd
A Sharon Stone Porn Movie!+P+One line.....great sex scenes.  Sharon, you little sl**!  Watch it and beat it+dvd
Zero chemistry+N+Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Talk of Angels&quot; could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest+dvd
"But carrots don't grow on trees!"+P+It doesn't matter how you like your humor, straight up, or on the rocks, the Black Adder is your man.  from the "Foretelling", where between  liberal interpretation of W.S. combined with the ruthless, crazy, humor likened to the Firesign Theater, and a deep well of humor about their own "bloody" history, to the end of the disc-"The Black Seal", if you don't laugh for at least 90 minutes of its 180 minute length, and this goes for the first 3 Black Adder disc's, and come away with a tired mind, keeping up with all the historical references, fractured or not, spun off by the excellent writing team of Curtis & Elton, along with a small cast of veteran Engligh actors, Peter Cook, Brian Blessed, anon, anon, then I say you better have your funny bone looked after, because you are in danger of loosing your sense of humor.  Also I would suggest buying a copy of The Black Adder by Penguin Books.  It will help, when  the humor comes too fast and is in the kings english, because you do not want to miss one joke, reference, or twisted tale of this disc.  +dvd
The dark side of attachment+P+Reage's O is the best-known of the SM novels, one of very few that has made it into the general awareness. This movie is a truncated version of the story, with some interesting differences.  A movie is a visual presentation, so many details have been added or filled in. In that respect, the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns, wide ties, and Farrah Fawcett hair for some of the women. Bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s, so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks, too. And, this movie comes from the time when "safe sex" meant not falling out of bed.  In an effort to approach main-stream audiences, many of the book's more repugnant elements have been dropped. Still, here's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements. The movie's pervasive theme of control, submission, and pain is intact. It will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone, and doesn't much appeal to me. The very last scene of the movie is a surprise, though. It's quite unlike the book, and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense.   //wiredweir+dvd
Plot, plot, and then more plot+N+A very intricate, involved thriller about a special effects man, an expert in disguise, and a plan to fake the death of a mafia kingpin who is about to talk to the authorities. All kinds of double dealings are going on here; in fact, so much story is going on with so little attention to character development that after it's over it all quickly begins to evaporate from your memory. Quickly forgettable. Bill Conti wrote the music, which is interesting+dvd
I can't believe I wasted my time with this.....+N+This movie is absolutley horrible. I heard it was an underground funny movie and was told it's a must watch. I think the only reason I made it through the whole thing was I kept waiting for the funny parts, next thing I know, the credits were rolling. BLEACH! Amazingly awful+dvd
Classic--Must have+P+This is the version of this film to have.  Many other versions are out there but the quality of those are severely lacking.  The film is outstandingly clear and every bit as wonderful as I remembered.  The vast array of special features are fascinating.  This is the one John Wayne film everyone should have+dvd

Slow Flow with an Iyengar twist+P+This DVD was great if you want a slower flowing yoga DVD.  I think this DVD is good for just about anybody familiar with yoga, and how to use yoga blocks.  Seane starts off slowly with meditation, breathing exercises, and then slowly starts going into the actual postures.  The postures themselves were not difficult for advanced beginner and up practioners.  However, Seane goes through these postures slowly enough where you will start to feel different parts of your body open up.  Seane pays a fair amount of attention to alignment (moreso than I am use to seeing in a Vinyasa Flow type DVD).  She takes her time getting into and out of the postures and this where I feel anyone can benefit from this DVD.  If you are the type of person looking for a Vinyasa Flow DVD to make you move, sweat, drop a few pounds, or want very challenging  postures, then this probably is not the DVD for you.  I would suggest Shiva Rae's Yoga Shakti DVD which has something for almost every skill level, except maybe the truly gifted and advanced yogis/yoginis out there (the arm balances she does are almost all intermediate to advanced).  However, if you want to really focus on the alignment and feeling of some of the more basic postures, and you are looking for something slower than the average flow yoga DVD, then this is a home run+dvd
Throw plausibility out the window in this stinker+N+We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours+dvd
When I was little I used to love VanDamme, and it's sad that he's come to this!+N+I am in my twenties now and am more into drama films and trendy artistic films from foreign countries (chalk that up to my wife's influence on me), but I still have a guilty predeliction for unapologetically mindless action movies where things blow up, bad guys do bad things for no apparent reason, and (of course) a heroic character defeats countless enemies using martial arts and other cool fighting techniques, while those same countless numbers of villains fail to kill him despite firing millions of rounds of machine gun ammunition at him.  I used to love Van Damme movies when I was aged 8-14, back when he was making better films, although I've always considered him a subpar actor (the same is also true, in my opinion, for Arnold Swarzennegger). I thought his martial arts scenes in movies like Bloodsport and Kickboxer were worth the rental price (or, in those days, asking my mom or dad to rent them for me).   Then came 1995's Timecop, and I absolutely loved that movie (as a child -- now it seems kind of tame and not as good as I remembered it). I thought VanDaame was finally becoming a better actor and fast on his way to being a megastar.  Unfortunately, VanDamme's career has faded since then, after a string of box-office and critical failures, and he has become more of a B-grade star and direct-to-video actor a-la Michael Dudinkoff (American Ninja). It's good to see that he's still working, but it seems like his work is really sucking right now. One exception might be 2000's Legionnaire, a VanDamme movie that is surprisingly good, though certainly no Hard Target -- a movie from his glory days.  For me, I think one of the biggest reasons why Van Damme is on a downward spiral as far as his movies go (aside from his lousy acting) is because he's lost credibility as a martial arts virtuoso. I chalk this up to the time he allegedly got beat up at a nightclub. In the version I heard, Van Damme was purportedly behaving in an obnoxious manner in the club, and security naturally confronted him and asked him to moderate his behavior, or leave. Van Damme then allegedly began mouthing off at the security guard (a beefy skinhead-looking guy) and performing various martial arts moves apparently designed to intimidate the other guy. The other guy, I guess, wasn't impressed because he then decked Van Damme with one right cross and Van Damme left the club on a stretcher.  Sigh.  How the mighty have fallen.  Oh, by the way, Second in Command sucks.+dvd
What happened??+N+Horrible, boring film from one of my top 10 favorite directors.  The only thing worth seeing is the amazing &quot;tiara&quot; of candles that Goya (supposedly?) uses to paint at night.  BORING!+dvd
And now you see how our state was suckered into the oil biz+N+I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food).  This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"?  Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley+dvd
My feet and quads thank you!+P+I bought this DVD last year and when I fell off of the exercise wagon, this was relegated to a drawer in the entertainment center.   After doing a Kathy Smith weight lifting routine last night, I picked this back up to stretch right before bed with the PM routine.  I'm 32, and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life.  But even I needed improvement, and along with cardio and weight training, I've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine.  My feet hurt from high heels.  My quads are too weak, and I fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger.  The stretches in the PM section for the quads and feet (love the massage!) were so good that for those reasons alone I'm committing to doing this every night to get the day's kinks out.  Lewis instructs you to start a stretch, contract a muscle, and then deepen the stretch.  I haven't seen this technique anywhere else, and I think it's a wonderful method for improving flexibility.  Unfortunately, it's only Noon right now and nowhere near bedtime.  I'm already looking forward to doing this one again.  One day I'll get up early enough to do the AM routine....+dvd
1 star is too much - way too much+N+The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these.  To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton.   These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this -  and neither do you. +dvd
Disappointed+N+I had high hopes for this.  After spending $24.95 to buy it, and watching the first disc, I don't even feel inspired to watch the other discs.  I am an alcoholic myself, and have been sober (thanks to AA) for 11 plus years.  I work in the medical field, and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis.  I found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing.  Perhaps it just shows the hunger of the American people to learn SOMETHING, ANYTHING about the subject of addiction.  It IS a complex subject, and I didn't find any answers here.    I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was.  If it was strictly to educate, I found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that DID'T include some of the most important ideas about addiction.  It was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you couldn't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing, to boot!  If it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction, I didn't feel in the least bit inspired.  I did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling, or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling.  I left the show vaguely confused, not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers.  There were exceptions, of course.  I enjoyed the Night in the ED segment, and I found the Steamfitters to be very "real" and human.  Addiction IS a terrible disease, and it deserves better treatment than this.     Probably the main thing that I did NOT like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards "magic bullet" thinking, which does a disservice to the addict.  That is, over and over are mentioned "exciting new medicines" and "getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict", which I find dangerous and misleading.  That is, it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new "miracle" drugs touted.  Perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  "Miracle drugs" which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years (antabuse and SSRI antidepressants come to mind), and none have a very impressive track record.  In fairness to the show, they do mention some of this, but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next "miracle drug".  I was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans, scientific speculation, and such, that there was NO mention whatsoever of any 12 step program, or any proven treatment center such as Hazeldon or the Betty Ford clinic.  Because the reality is, while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine, there are real humans out there in the world who are SUCCESSFULLY HELPING THEIR FELLOW HUMANS TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.  What a concept!  And without miracle drugs even!  Getting clean and sober is not easy, and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything, and b) not to mention real life programs available now (often free) that have proven track records, and offer REAL hope.    If you like science, be aware that Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown SCIENTIFICALLY in study after study to have THE SINGLE BEST TRACK RECORD AT KEEPING ALCOHOLICS SOBER.  Is it for everyone?  No, but if you want to get (and more importantly STAY) sober, the odds are better with AA as a follow-up (after initial treatment) than with anything else that you can name.  "It works if you work it" as they say in AA.  I have no direct experience with other 12 step programs, and so can't comment, but I know that they operate very similarly.  WHY on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program?  I sat with my jaw hanging down as I watched the entire show, and AA was only mentioned twice:  once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something "through AA", (that in itself is an amazing accomplishment, and should say all you need to know about AA), and later in the show on the Steamfitters  who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to AA would be somehow 'wimpy' for manly men like them.  I don't where they got that impression, because I've never heard of AA being called 'wimpy' (or whatever term they used).  AA's full of bikers, construction workers, etc., right alongside the doctors and lawyers.  That's the beauty of it: it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries, and shows what we addicts have IN COMMON.  The irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE AN AA GROUP AND MEETING!  I was laughing - there was almost no difference.  So if you want to know what an AA meeting is like, watch the steamfitters.  The sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts.  And the power of "it takes one to know one" that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why AA is so effective.  Who wants to listen to a scientist?  If you're an addict or an alcoholic, you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic.  They've walked a mile in your shoes.  So to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah, blah, blah with little real inspirational meat or insight.  If you want some real scientific insight into how this "brain disease" works (at least the alcoholic version), try the book "Beyond the Influence", available from Amazon.  Good meat there.  If you want to see some good talk from people who have (to me) better insight into the whole addiction thing, search online for the Larry King Live addiction show which featured Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty Ford's daughter from the Betty Ford clinic.  Transcripts are available online.  It was an incredible show.  Coincidentally, one of the "researchers" who appears on the HBO special was also on the Larry King show, and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level.  You will see what I'm talking about.   +dvd
Lousy lousy lousy+N+Contentwise, I won't toss darts OR roses. This is genre stuff. You either like it or you don't. My beef is with the technical quality. It is execrable. (1) It is NOT in widescreen (Cinemascope), which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular. There is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a DVD issued in the year 2000. (2) The so-called "digital remastering" must be kitchen-table grade, because the shapes are fuzzy, colors oversaturated, visuals mushy. This DVD should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted. I get better quality from my VHS of this movie than the DVD I purchased. Lousy lousy lousy, as I said.+dvd

Car 54,where are you?What about Studio 54?+N+Saw this movie once&don't want to see it again.  Jim Carrey,before getting more mature roles in "Man in the Moon","Eternal Sunshine"&"Truman Show",indulges in endless slapstick,gets plenty of gross-out humor,beds Courtney Cox (before "Friends",David Arquette&baby Coco)&finds out oh!the horror!the horror!he's kissed a man.Since this was before "Brokeback"&Heath&Jake won their Best Kiss from the MTV movie awards,Jim goes through an elaborate "purification" ceremony.

Poor at Best+N+I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys.  Currently "The Yards" and "Ghost World" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf.  I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it.  Slow story, not enough character development.  All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is+dvd
An enlightening and mesmerizing film!+P+This is a good movie with comments to make on many levels.  It shows the heartache that one couple has to overcome after losing a child.  There is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy, a pleasant, caring woman who has been breaking the law for 16 years.  Then there is the story of two boys who play their rifle games oblivious to what harm they are doing to other people, completely innocent people.   Does their culture create people, even young ones, who are so irresponsible?  Today's newspapers confirm the film's answer . . a resounding yes.  And, attached to the film's plot by a very slender thread, the Japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her, including the audience.  I wouldn't necessarily call this film enjoyable, but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film.  It also has probably the best role that Brad Pitt has ever had or played.+dvd
Great Set+P+This set is great for early film buffs.  But, since most of them are in the public domain, they are easily found online at government sites to download free.  Spending a few hours downloading from the Library of Congress site, and you will have the same collection+dvd
Could have been worse...+N+Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. *+dvd
Henry V+P+This is a wonderful production of Henry V. The acting is magnificant, I would highly recommend this DVD.+dvd
Blah...+N+I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me+dvd
disappointed+N+after reading the reviews from pbs i was excited to see the film. im so happy i rented it as opposed to getting it from here, which i would have done had i not found it somewhere else. while all the teachers had great intentions, it was obvious they were not equipped with the skills needed to engage the children in a community/learning environment. from observing body language and facial expressions in some of the classes, the children were not engaged (notice how they lit up when they were finally engaged through the photo project!). the answers to questions about behavior were the answers that the teachers wanted to hear and the teachers knew it. if they watched the video, i hope they would take not at how they talked to the students (a couple teachers in particular). getting angry, answering your own question, making students write why they wont misbehave anymore, etc. are old school ways of gaining compliance and they wont reach todays children. this video would not make me want to be a teacher, if anything, it shows just how much preservice teachers need to be exposed to various cultures, they need to learn how to build a community in the classroom, and they need mentors who are aware of the needs of diverse learners. in order to attract students to a profession, make a video that highlights teachers who are able to make a difference despite the odds, schools that have made drastic turnarounds, and students who excel when they should be another negative statistic. there are some positive things in the video, they are just overshadowed by the other stuff. and, yes, i agree with a previous writer. another video could have been used in the classroom to expose students to the lives of homosexuals+dvd
Film Noir in Living Color+N+I find it insulting that not only does the woman like the guy for treatign her like garbage, being rude, insulting, and abusive, but she likes it, and still sees him after he nearly rapes her. That sort of thing sends a bad message. Real men don't behave that way--only inferior males with severe psychological damage. Seems all the characters in this movie are messed up. Colin Farrel's character was teased as a child for being Italian, so now he's a mysogynist bigot. Selma Hayek's character is Mexican, can't read English, so she's willing to but up with physical and mental abuse, and has TB, possiblly from her bartender friend. The bartender definately has TB, and wants to be a writer, just like everyone living in Los Angeles. Donald Sutherland's character is a drunk. He has about 10 minutes of screen time. There's another woman who is badly burned (no information is given on how this happened) over a large portion of her body. This causes her to latch onto various passing males with a fierce attachment that borders on psychotic. Of the characters, she probablly has the best explanation for being messed up, though the form the writer took to show it is dubious.  And there are two scenes which could have been totally cut from the movie without any loss to the story. There's a nude midnight swim in the freezing cold ocean. And of course, there's the prolonged bare-backside sex scene, where the camera seems fascinated with every pore and folicle in Colin Ferral's glutious maximus.  The story doesn't really move, and the resolution doesn't satisfy. While pretty, the attempt to capture the period is ultimately unsuccessful. And the earthquake scene is so stupid and poorly executed that the thing is laughable.  Between this movie, Tigerland, PhoneBooth, and Alexander, I have to wonder how Colin Ferrel ever got a career started. It certainly wasn't based on acting tallent. Seems to have more to do with his willingness to have his bare posterior on film+dvd
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these...+P+...it might have been."  In the early to mid 50's, many studios were churning out comedies, perhaps more so in an effort to get people past those old post war blues, but few did it as well or consistently as the British Ealing Studios (in my humble opinion), helped immensely by the talents of Alec Guinness...what?!  Alec Guinness a comedic actor?  The same Alec Guinness who starred in such serious films as The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), and A Passage to India (1984)?  Yes, it seemed by the end of the 1950's, Guinness had pretty much dedicated himself to more serious parts, but not altogether as he later appeared in the fantastic comedy Murder by Death (1976), which I recommend to anybody in search of a truly good laugh.  While many consider The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) to be one of the best of the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I'm partial to one of their later films, The Ladykillers (1955), which was recently remade by the Coen brothers and featured Tom Hanks (I've haven't seen it yet, but I heard not so good things about it).  Directed by Charles Crichton (The Titfield Thunderbolt, A Fish Called Wanda), the film stars, along with Guinness, Stanley Holloway (Nicholas Nickleby, Passport to Pimlico).  Also appearing is Sid James (The 39 Steps, Upstairs and Downstairs) and Alfie Bass (The Fearless Vampire Killers, Revenge of the Pink Panther).  This comedic caper begins in a tropical setting, where we meet a man named Henry Holland (Guinness), who seems quite popular probably because of the fact he's pretty free with his money.  He thus begins to relate a tale to another man, taking us into a flashback that makes up the rest of the film and we learn Holland, prior to being a somewhat well to do philanthropist sort in South America, actually came from humble beginnings as in a previous life he was a mild mannered bank worker, responsible for regularly escorting gold shipments from the smelting facility (that's where they take the raw gold and turn it into bars), to the bank.  His coworkers and superiors look upon him as a quiet, by the book sort with no ambition, imagination, or initiative, as `his one and only virtue is honesty'.  And that's exactly the way Holland likes it...especially since he aspires to one day steal one of shipments of gold and live out his days well beyond his current means.  The only problem is, once stolen, gold bars are extremely difficult to transfer into cash...but a solution soon presents itself in the form of a new tenant to the boarding house Holland resides, one named Alfred Pendlebury (Holloway)...the name of the tenant, not the boarding house...Mr. Pendlebury just happens to operate a modest die casting business, one whose specialty is producing paperweights, one perfectly suited for Holland's needs.  Soon the die is cast (so to speak), and the pieces are in place, but, as everyone knows, even the best-laid plans are subject to disaster once in the implementation stage as the human element is always the most unpredictable.  As I said before, of all the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I prefer The Ladykillers most of all, probably due to the darker tone of the material and more outlandish nature of the characters, but that's not to say this film isn't of superior quality, as it won an Academy Award for best writing, story and screenplay, and earned Guinness his first nomination (Gary Cooper won for his role in High Noon).  One of things I like most about these older comedies is they don't pander to the lowest common denominator in terms of comedic content, but rather speak to the audience with respect, maintaining a consistent level of intelligence not so often seen nowadays...but that's not to say this couldn't be enjoyed by anyone.  I had originally seen this film quite a number of years ago, and appreciated it for the more visual elements as opposed to last night when I enjoyed the more subtle aspects due to a general understanding one usually gains with maturity.  Regardless, this is one of those films where everything works well together to bring about a wonderful story.  The direction is exceptionally strong and wastes none of the films lean 81 minutes running time.  Guinness is about as good as you'll ever see him, fostering a belief that he is, now and forever, the meticulous, level-headed, slightly devious character of Henry Holland (at least until his next film), but is certainly assisted (nearly upstaged) by his costar Holloway, the romantic character, yearning to express his artistic nature, stifled by the drudgery of actually having to earn a living through the mass production of tourist souvenirs.  There are any number of wonderful scenes and sequences presented throughout the film, but two come to my mind as being my favorites.  One features Mr. Pendlebury moving into the boarding house where Holland lives, and Holland learning of Pendlebury's profession which sets in motion him gingerly broaching the possibility of utilizing Pendlebury's die casting business as a means to process the stolen booty.  Holland and Pendlebury, both eventually on the same page, begin almost convincing each other and themselves of the very real possibility that it can be done...the other is the scene where Holland and Pendlebury go about enlisting a couple of extra, but necessary, members for the gang, as the gold shipment is too much for the two of them to handle themselves.  It's not like you can put an ad out in the paper for such a thing, so they utilize a very unique method to contact prospective applicants.  And there's a bonus!  If you love classic movies, you'll be in for a treat...watch for the appearance of a minor character, played by a soon to be legendary actress, about three or four minutes into the film...yes, that's who you think it is...but don't blink, or you'll miss it...  Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a very clean and clear full screen (original aspect ratio) picture on this DVD, with a decent Dolby Digital mono audio.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, and an extensive Alec Guinness biography and liner notes.  By the way, I heard there is a remake of this film in the works, scheduled to be released in 2006...I guess time will tell if it's any good or not, but the way I see it, what's the point?  I hardly see how they could improve upon the original...  Cookieman108  By the way, there is, as I write this, an Alec Guinness DVD set offered by Anchor Bay Entertainment featuring five of his early comedies, including this one, offered at a price that is cheaper than purchasing these DVDs separately, so if you're interested, it might be worth looking into...+dvd
revolting prelude+N+I hate this film and "The Ballad of Cable Hoge," because of its depiction of animal cruelty. This happens just at the prelude of both films.+dvd
Horrible+N+DO NOT WATCH THIS GARBAGE! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm honestly upset with the other reviewers here for misleading me so badly. This film is so bad, with so many problems I don't know where to even begin. I can only hope that someone on the verge of watching this changes their mind after reading this review. If I saved one person from buying/watching this disaster, then I have done my job. At the very least buy it from the used bin, that's where mine will be+dvd
Not For Kids+N+Got it for the kids. After watching the first few, everyone agreed that we should not have purchased it. Good story, but too much gender content. Gets young kids thinking about what is underneath the clothing ... Sad+dvd
Strength and perseverance+P+This is a good movie. Thora Birch is convincing. The story is incredible. Sometimes it is a little slow but it's worth the time one takes to see it. It's inspirational.+dvd
uplifting+P+Can you believe I just saw this movie. I had the pleasure of listening to Liz Murray at an AWHONN convention.  It's not even that she is a seasoned speaker...she told her story. I instantly was drawn to her. If you think you have problems...well you can hardly believe someone could overcome all that she has. I left that convention with a whole different attitude about life. I can hardly wait for my girls to watch it, because all I have done is talk about her+dvd
Really unfunny movie, baby!+N+Boy, was this a disappointment. The Curmudgeon was a big fan of the first movie, a clever parody of Bond movies, but it seems the ol' creative and comic barrel had ran empty this time around. God knows what drivel they put out for the third film - I was not tempted to see that.  So what's the problem(s)? Well, for one - Austin Powers. He's just not funny in this, in fact he's just downright annoying. Once the scenes begin to go on you realise just how much of a 2-D character he really is. No-one expects a fully realised emotional character, but a little range and depth would work wonders. You can actually see Myers struggling as the movie continues.  We'll pass by the unfunny names which were covered in the opening review, and talk about Dr Evil. The best character in the first (and still in this) has also been spoiled - maybe it's too much of him or.. I dunno. Oh, wait - yes I do. They have him RAP. Nice one Mike - let's make a character do something he would NEVER do for the sake of a cheap laugh. Yeah, it's a comedy, but even characters should have limits and contexts, and Dr Evil was just ruined after that. Mini-Me is a failure, his only contributions are giving the finger to people. Oh, my sides. Plus, when you add in Fat Bastard, a tedious "baby-eater" with Myers horrific attempt at a Scottish accent, you aren't so much rolling in the aisles as charging up them towards the exit.  This movie would probably have scored two stars, but I'm deducting another for all the idiots who thought it original and amusing to say "Grooooooovy baby" etc and think they were the King Of Comedy. Hey, my reviews my rules+dvd
A few amusing moments ... could have been much better+N+I agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been.  Gilda Radner was a very talented comedy actress but this DVD does not showcase enough of her best work.  Sure, the dance number with Steve Martin is a classic, as are a couple of the commercials such as "Hey, You," but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl, Lisa Loopner or the usually gross Roseanne Roseannadanna.  It focuses too much on her as an individual, not the integral part of the SNL ensemble that she was.  One of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other SNL videos I have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show.  I was disappointed with this, I didn't chuckle as much as I thought I would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring, or gross.  I won't be getting any more of these SNL compilation DVDs because they simply don't know how to produce them so that they are funny.  I noticed a similar problem with an SNL 25th anniversary compilation.  I think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current SNL show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time+dvd
Woody is soooo young here+P+Very funny for Woody's first full length feature.  He's an incompetant bank robber and his wife is a laundress.  Enjoy+dvd
Can I get a refund for that ninety minutes of my life?+N+Tangled (Jay Lowi, 2001)  Shawn Hatosy has been doing the character-actor thing in Hollywood for a long time. Lowi, in his first feature film, gives Hatosy a starring role, and pairs him opposite established stars Rachael Leigh Cook (Antitrust) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Titus), as well as throwing Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos) into the mix-- and he still can't come up with a good movie.  Now, I'll watch Jonathan Rhys Meyers in anything, and I have, and I still had trouble with this mess. The basic idea: David Klein (Hatosy) wakes up in a hospital with a police detective (Bracco) at his side. It seems Kelin's girlfriend Jenny (Cook) and his best friend Alan Hammond (Meyers) are both missing from the wreckage of Hammond's car, where Klein was found. Klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective, piecemeal, with scenes from the present intercut.   Predictable, boring, cliched, two-dimensional, need I go on? If the ending of Jodi Picoult novels comes as a shock to you, you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise. No one else will. * +dvd
Always Raunchy, Often Disgusting, Rarely Funny+N+And definitely not worth buying.  This movie dishes out nastiness that makes Friday the 13th seem quaint and lovable by comparison.  Jay and Silent Bob are rotten people, and you will feel rotten after watching this fitlth.  You might laugh a time or two, but you won't feel good about doing it.+dvd
Dissapointing Movie+N+A poor documentary. An attempt to make porn acceptable and very unsexy at that. A repulsive movie.   Watch instead the recent made for TV series entitled Rome.  The series Rome is accurate and entertaining and without a doubt the best of its type ever made+dvd
Happiness is -To Follow that Dream+P+The story of a squatter family is a rollicking success. Arthur O'Connell as the pappy is hilarious. The dialogue is cleaver and Elvis plays the roll of an innocent, not very well educated young beefcake to perfection. The laughter starts as the movie begins to roll and continues throughout. There are not many songs in the movie by Elvis does sing the beautiful "Angel" to a starry eyed Anne Helm. I found that the 97 minutes flew by and the movie had a "feel good" effect on me. The true sign of good entertainment.+dvd
Dreamgirls+P+I went to the movies with the thought that I probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised. I love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles. I am not what you call a Beyonce fan, but I found myself enjoying her in this role. I have always loved musicals and can't wait to add this one to my collection. My grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs.+dvd
No Problems+P+I purchased all four season on July 17th. There has been no problems with  the discs. I hope others will purchase these so that all eight seasons will be available for fans+dvd
"smeggin' awesome"+P+If seasons 1 and 2 of this fantasticly written, orginal series were good, season three is...well, think of a good word for even better and plug it in. In the orginal first two seasons the gags were based mostly on dialouge.  While they were still hysterical, season three can bost more action-based and even funnier gags, such as the killer-kebab. Plus the dialouge is still up to its old standards, anything but shoddy.  The only dissapointing thing about this season is that the actor who plays Holly leaves (I belive he quit because they weren't paying him as much as the others)and is replaced by the actress who  played "Hilly" in the plaralell universe.  I'm sorry, but she just doesn't have the same comedic air as the "original Holly". Other than that, the show only gets better.  And the trend continues with Season four+dvd
Suprisingly wicked and funny... lots of twists and turns+P+Another good movie with rupert everett...he simply has a good sense of humor that flows naturally in all the characters he portray especially in this movie. Cate blanchett is spectacular. I would say, this movie has a very unpredictable and funny,some evil plot but not a boring story at all. My husband and i simply love this movie. He has to thank me over and over again for getting this for his valentine gift+dvd
Exciting+P+Entertaining romantic fairy-tale with Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields. The pretty Emmeline and her attractive companion Richard, after being shipwrecked, land on a lush tropical island. Over the years their mutual affection develops into a beautiful, innocent love relationship. But their paradise doesn't stay undisturbed. Very lovely movie performance about that what dreams are made of+dvd
Excellent both Nude and Clothed+P+I've owned this DVD for some time now. I've watched it several times and enjoyed it very much each and every time. The women are beautiful and seem to be really having fun as they exercise, especially nude. The clothed version is very nice, too. Of course, being a guy, I prefer them nude. I also like the fact tha the four women seem to have no modesty at all-- they never tried to cover up or hide anything; in fact, sometimes they seemed to be exposed a little more than necessary (no complaints here!). I like this DVD very much and would recommend it to any man who wants to enjoy watching beautiful nude women, also to any man who wants to get his wife to exercise (especially nude and beautiful)+dvd
terrible casts, bad screenplay, bad directing.....+N+this is the first jane austen's novel that was poorly done into a movie. i could never imagine that bbc would did such a bad job. all the casts are so bad, the screenplay, my god, is so bad that it would take a great deal of patience to watch along and stay in a sitting position. all the casts are so bad, none of them are likable unless you are just like one of them. what a terrible directing and acting. the screenplay, my god, is so bad, i just don't want to get into the details... stay away from this deadbeat and don't waste your lifetime in this pathetic movie, see other versions+dvd
Best movie ever!+P+I love this movie and have for years.  I bought the DVD because I think that my video is nearly worn out+dvd
freaky stuff!+P+i got this movie a while back wheen i was looking for j-horror live action movies and suprisingly, this movie was very freaky. it is horror but the "dumplings" short is the freakist of them all. if you watch this movie youll understand, just dont eat while watching if you have a weak stomach. all in all, i give it 5 stars cause it was one of the wierdest movies from japan ive seen yet+dvd
Purchase with confidence+P+If you're thinking of buying this collection, chances are that you're most interested in F.W. Murnau's 1927 silent masterpiece Sunrise.  (For whatever reasons Fox may have, this is currently the only official way to get hold of the Sunrise DVD.)  My review is mainly aimed at those folks, so I'll try to answer the question: Is it worth buying the other three to get Sunrise?  Short answer: Definitely!  Fox's DVD transfer of Sunrise, which is an upgrade from an earlier Laserdisc release, is superb.  No kidding, it's actually comparable to the best current transfers of silent films, like Kino's Metropolis, WB's Chaplins, and Criterion's Passion of Joan of Arc.  Considering that any of those titles would cost you about what you'll pay for this whole collection, you've got to figure that you're getting a pretty good deal.  Long answer:  I actually believe that two of the other three films here are masterpieces in their own right.  How Green Was My Valley, which has unjustly been labelled as the film that "stole" Best Picture from Citizen Kane, ranks among John Ford's best efforts; it's a genuinely beautiful, though an admittedly sentimental, film.  And it's one of those movies that received a solid restoration a few years ago -- back when AMC actually showed good movies and took a hand in these sorts of projects.  All About Eve, of course, needs no introduction.  I find it a tad too long, but I agree that it has one of the best scripts ever written and some fantastic performances.  It has finally received a full restoration from Fox -- all the speckles are gone (though some of the image's sharpness has gone, too).  Gentleman's Agreement, on the other hand, is one of those movies that's easier to admire for its aims than for its entertainment value or aesthetics.  It has dated badly, and Fox's lack of restoration work isn't likely to get it rediscovered any time soon.  So my opinion is that you get three great films (and one of historical interest) for a very reasonable price.  Each title comes with quite a few extras, if that matters to you -- though here again I think Sunrise benefits from the most informative and interesting extras, including a semi-reconstruction of one of Murnau's "lost" films.  Highly recommened+dvd
Great show, terrible dvds+N+I want to first say that I love Thundercats. Along with gi joe and transformers, it ranks as one of the greatest cartoons of the '80s. The reason for my 1 star review has nothing to do with the show, but instead with the dvds. For such a price it really is highway robbery.   The episodes look like they were taken from tv. No remastering or enhancement, you can still see white marks and scratches. Also, as mentioned in another review, the background music is missing from some episodes. Along with that, the menus are sorely lacking. They're very short and without any imagination or flair. Except for the main menu, all the submenus are just still images from the show.   And don't fall for the specials. There is a 25 minute documentary with some of the voice artists and producers, but it felt rushed. Not all of the voice artists were interviewed, and with such a show, I'm sure they have enough material for a full 60 minute documentary. One further complaint, no chapters in the episodes. The entire episode is just one big chapter. At least rhino was able to split the episodes into scenes.   I would swallow my pride if this cost 19.99 or thereabouts, but not for this price. The lack of detail and quality just shows all over this release; don't you just hate corporate greed.+dvd
Not worth the time and money...+N+Overall a bad buy! Horrible DVD mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that don't work. The movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it, but nothing really "finished." The extended scenes aren't scored, which is really distracting because I couldn't stop thinking about the great "Mondo Bongo" song that should have been there during the alternate ending, et al!  Don't bother with this one... check out the Directors Cuts of "Kingdom of Heaven" (amazing!) and "King Arthur" - they're both very worthwhile+dvd
enjoyable but a bit disappointing+P+Martin Scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he.  But, of course, Scorsese really should have won for Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas, and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement.  This is a decent, entertaining picture, but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best, I think, or one of the best pictures of recent years.  The acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast: it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts.  Damon is surprisingly good, capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness, and Walhberg stands out, though he is on screen too rarely.  DiCaprio does a nice job, except that I think sometimes the pressure to have him play "vulnerable" and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative: that no one believes him to be the cop, given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence, is a bit preposterous.  The basic storyline, which is almost exactly the same, scene for scene, as in Infernal Affairs, is a pretty neat one, with a lot of nice reversals and twists, though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie.  But, somehow, for me, this film just ultimately didn't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it.  Perhaps because I had seen the original version of this tale, the specific changes and updates made to it in Monahan's script to make things "Scorsesian" seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic.  In the end, I had this peculiar feeling like I had just seen almost an imitation Scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones, pasted onto the Infernal Affairs framework.  It may be that, after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent, more personal projects, a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground, to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment, and thus maybe even Scorsese's heart wasn't totally into this project; while certainly there's an energy here, the technical work doesn't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work.  It may also be that, after living with the Sopranos for years and all the Scorsese wanna-be mob pictures, that I am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre, that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me.  So, certainly recommended for viewing, but the Departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done+dvd
Not  as Pleasant as Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled. +N+I really wanted to like this movie because I think the Duff sisters are cute and actually have some potential.  This movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought.  Hilary and Hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money, then get it back--an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the Hilton sisters live for real.  About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston.  For good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend 10 Things I Hate About You and the old 80s classic hit, John Hughes' Sixteen Candles.  Where this movie is concerned, I wouldn't recommend it to your dog's fleas.+dvd
Great Memories+P+I loved this show when it was on TV originally.  It's so nice to see it again.  Eventually I'll have to get the other seasons on DVD+dvd
The perfect movie that makes guns useless.+P+This movie has the realistic arts of violence with knives (not guns). LT bonham (tommy lee jones) who is a military instructor who trained Aaron hallam (benicio del toro) very well to become a killing machine. after the war experience aaron goes through in kosovo aaron cannot seem to turn off his deadly technique skills of killing. Now aaron gets out of control the cops can't stop him & opening fire at him won't help at all it just ends up with more casualties of cops and the only one who can stop him is LT which becomes a deadly cat mouse game and a gruesom battle between a teacher and a student which was a really good fight. This movie deserves 5/5 stars for good actors and A good storyline too.+dvd
Throw Your Metaphorical Tomatoes+N+I'd be hard pressed to find one funny skit--no, one funny moment at all--in this DVD set.  Mencia's drivel pretty much reminds me of a lot of David Letterman's "Top Ten" lists; anyone above the age of thirteen could have thought any of this up.  It's actually mind numbing how bad some of these jokes are.  I'm not bashing--I'm warning.  Comedy Central is advertising this as sort of a replacement for the (much) superior Chapelle's Show.  Viewer, do not be fooled.  Carlos Mencia is the most boring man on television.   But I'll give him this; if he came out with this material in the early 1990s, it may have passed.  But, like "Mama Jokes", this humor has long dried up.  0/1+dvd
Amazing collection....all bonus features intact!!!+P+This is a wonderful collection.....normally in box sets you get a lot of fluff with a classic or two if your lucky....well this set offers up pretty much nothing but classics.  Harvey is of course a legendary film and performance by Stewart and the bonus features on this DVD being the introduction by Stewart himself is wonderful.  The two Westerns are interesting because Destry Rides Again is a very very early film for Mr Stewart and something of a minor classic while Winchester '73 is a major movie which many feel brought back the Western in the early 50's and also ignited a decade plus reign of Mr Stewart as a major star of Westerns as well as working with this same director Anthony Mann on many occaisions.  This version of Winchester '73 ..while showing some age on the negative is pretty high quality but the BONUS audio track which runs the feature length with  Mr Stewart is priceless.  So ...what's left? Ony two of Alfred Hitchcocks greatet films...Vertigo and Rear Window.....the remastered versions which look great and feature wonderful bonus materials on the makings of the films and restorations of them.... I don't want to waste your time with plot lines etc...for all 5 films....but want to congratulate Universal for giving us "all killer , no filler" on this James Stewart "collection" ....a great value and a wonderful look at some of the most important work by this Hollywood Legend+dvd
More than amazing fight choreography+P+This film is a martial arts film, but not a typical one.  It does have stunning fight scenes (the opening will leave you breathless), that are fast paced and well thought out.  However it isn't all fight scenes, there is a lot of character development with the protaganist (Jet Li).  You see him as a child, and this shows how Huo Yuan Jia's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed.  He will go through an incredible transformation before the film's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts.        The story is very effective, and has a good deal of touching moments. Jet Li fits the role well, and like "Hero" it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is.  His facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character.     Target audience: Anyone in their teens and above who don't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy+dvd
History with Humor+P+Two of my grown daughters love this musical (hence the reason for my purchasing a second copy).  The one loves it for the music and the wit, the other for the presentation of historical information.  I've always enjoyed the music and the costume.  My only caveat is the historical anachronism of profanity in the mouths of pious men. +dvd
Forbidden Hollywood+P+This DVD is fascinating! We are history fans and this very enlightening DVD is loaded with facts and cuts of movies that you won't believe+dvd
Great Collection and Price...+P+This is a wonderful selection of the Martin and Lewis Colgate Comedy Hours.  The show used revolving hosts, and Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were by far the most popular.  For those that are only familiar with the team through their films, this collection will be a revelation.  The duo's television appearances are only a slightly toned down version of their live act-and that was legendary.  The show dates are not indicated on the packaging, so here they are: 1-2/4/51, 2-1/25/53, 3-11/4/51, 4-4/29/51, 5-12/19/54 (next to last appearance), 6-11/13/55 (last appearance and the next-to-last episode of the show), 7-No date can be found, but it is the 8th Anniversary of the team on the Comedy Hour, broadcast from Atlantic City.  The set also includes trailers for some of their films-great stuff, especially for the films filmed in VistaVision, where the process is promoted as much as the team.  (&quot;Bigger, Brighter, Funnier!&quot;)  Grab this one+dvd
Former Martial Arts Sensei Geting Lazy+N+The Great One (who is also a producer here) takes up one of his worst films, namely sleep-inducing `The Foreigner,' and he does the same role that nobody seems to remember. One good news is that the sequel turns out more decent than the original, but that isn't saying much.  In `Black Dawn' Steven Seagal plays Jonathan Cold again, who is at first seen helping the brother of one bad arms dealer break out of jail, apparently working for the bad guys. Well, perhaps he should have, for in that case things might have been more interesting than this dull B action film.  Besides the obvious stunt doubles, the inept editing, and the chubby face of the star who seems to prefer to stay out of the `action scenes,' you will see CIA agent played by Tamara Davies, also former protégé of Cold. There is one so-so action involving a runaway garbage truck and some OK shoot-outs, but their terrible acting which occupies most of the second half of the film makes everything dull in the end. The idea of Chechen terrorists or nuke attack are reduced to nothing because of the hulk of the star who seems not to care.  What you see `in Black Dawn' is your former aikido sensei getting lazy in his work. That's a sad thing to see+dvd
Painful to watch+N+I thought when I saw Steven Seagal in the movie, "how could you go wrong getting this?"  After seeing just 30 minutes of it, I knew how wrong it could go.  This is at best a B movie+dvd
Whip, Gun and Typewriter+N+Having read all these reviews presently on line, it was not hard to find a fair number with which I can agree that this is an abysmal film, even despite the surprisingly impressive physical production values, in the attention to detail that was taken to recreate the physical appearance of the death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.  Too bad a director with a script telling the truth about the place wasn't there on the set with film and crew to take advantage of it.  Many an astutely observed fault has come to be mentioned in a good number of these reviews, as per the really tacky concept of the screenplay itself, the almost adolescent quality to the writer/director's touch; the lack of content in dialogue, the resulting shallowness of characterization for the actors' roles. All of that was well observed, and yet what amounts to the worst fault of all remains without mention, the one thing I had hoped to find which would have obviated any necessity of adding one more, regrettably lengthy review to a long list of them.  Okay, so, am I the only one among the whole lot of us here who comes into it sickened by the violent vandalism that has been wreaked  upon the historical record of the actual event by this writer/director? Artistic license is one thing but willful distortion of the public knowledge to a purpose of questionable motivation is quite another.  If a viewer of this film is familiar with only so much as what can be learned about the revolt of October 7, 1944 from the official website of the Auschwitz Museum at Auschwitz (see the article "Resistance Movement at KL Auschwitz-Berkenau", a pdf file), then one fundamental fact will be known: that the only non-Jewish Poles who were in any way associated with the sonderkommando, were there exclusively in the capacity of kapos, not as crematorium workers; they were the head-bashing S.S. appointed guards (often imported from Polish prisons) whose duties consisted strictly in serving as foreman and cop, to keep the death machine running smoothly and well greased on the blood of Jewish worker and Jewish victim, alike.  Well might one inquire into exactly what is being served by Tim Blake Nelson's intent of assigning every sympathetic role in his script to either a Gentile Pole or the Nazi SS--Oberscharfuhrer (Keitel) who has to stay drunk to do what the Jews are doing comparatively sober? So you have these purely mythical Gentile Polish workers of the sonderkommando who are by far, moral superiors to the Jews (typified by the Buscemi character) who soon reveal themselves to be everything that the Keitel character in his Jew-hatred, only lately gained, has to say of them.  And what had this SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt to say, but such things as would be based on strict observation, since having seen now how low a Jew can really go, doing to their fellow Jews, what they would so totally not want done unto them. Yet what the Harvey Keitel character doesn't observe, and what Tim Blake Allen's script does not observe is that these Jews under his whip and gun (and/or typewriter) are doing only the same as this Oberscharfuhrer is doing under nowhere near the force of coercion; not to the Jews alone, but as the SS enforcement arm of the Gestapo, to any decent or dissident German, to the whole world, as a cog in the wheel of the greater Reich's death machine.  And so the Keitel character fancies himself to be shocked to learn that Jews, just like any German such as himself, can knuckle under and bow, tremble in fear under the marching boots of tyranny, to the surrender of every shred of human decency for sake of howling "Sieg Heil!" safely going with the flow of society; how shocked he pretends himself to be to discover that Jews are no better than he, that given the worst of circumstances, they like he should become killers, money-grubbing wheeler-dealers showing themselves to be by turns, brutal or calculating murderers--traitors to their own kind.  But this is not, alas, what is to be gleaned from the script of Tim Blake Nelson's filthy little movie. Quite to the contrary, if a person is not aware of what actually did occur, historically, as from a book like Filip Muller's "Eyewitness Auschwitz: Three Years in the Gas Chambers", then you well might wind up pinning five Amazon stars on the guy with the thought well implanted, most subliminally, in mind that SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt didn't really have it all so wrong, after all.  It's not hard to be tricked. See the fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters of Mozart, Goethe and Schiller, circa 1933.+dvd
The Most Hate-Inducing, Racist Film Ever!+N+A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.    Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is "preserve the Aryan race."  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.  Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.    They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.    In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess+dvd
Brilliant cast --- with one exception+P+This was a brilliant show on stage ( I saw the London cast performance ) and the DVD reflects the outstanding performances of this case in these unforgettable and inimitable dances.  There is one exceptuion, who for me very nearly ruins the whole show --- Ben Vereen. The show seems to have been engineered to enable him to show off, and his limited dancing and singing skills, combined with monumentally smug demeanour, reduces the efectiveness of the stellar cast.  The stage show I saw was so much better for not having him in it.  He is one of these talents who seem unacoutnably sucessful and popular in the USA, and for many of us in the rest of the work, his charms are invisible. +dvd
Absolutely waste of money!!+N+I bought this DVD a while back from Amazon. I was very disappointed with the dvd. It's a joke!,really. He was worse than the beginner dancer. I watched the DVD for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that I paid for this?. I will not accept this if someone give it to me for FREE. If you're serious in learning salsa, the New York Salsa DVD series are very good. Don't waste your money on this one!+dvd
Wonderful production of Wilde's best loved comedy+P+This 1952 version of the Oscar Wilde classic romantic is as good to watch today as it ever was. Michael Redgrave stars as Ernest Worthing, (whose name, in fact, is really John), a man who, as a baby, had been found in a bag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station. The story is a comedy of errors and confusions around names, in particular the name Ernest. Mr Worthing wants to marry Gwendoline, daughter of the formidable Lady Bracknell. He dare not tell his beloved that his name is not really Ernest as she has expressed a desire only to wed a man of that name. Gwendoline's cousin, Algernon, is pursuing Mr Worthing's ward, Cecily, but she does not know his real name, she believes he is called Ernest. The comedy starts when Cecily and Gwendoline meet for the first time and realise they are both betrothed to `Ernest Worthington'. The film stars Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism and Dame Edith Evans as the snobbish Lady Bracknell. Both actresses play their roles extremely well, as you would expect from such grand dames of the stage.  There are a few extras on this DVD (region 2 version) which include a profile of `The Importance of Being Earnest', a `behind the scenes' gallery, a theatrical trailer and biographies of the main actors and the director. The picture is crystal clear and the colours bright. Sound quality is good and there are subtitles for the hard of hearing. All in all, a very good version of one of Wilde's best known and loved works.+dvd
Lack of blonde ambition!+N+I only gave this movie 2 stars because of its 2 stars: Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield. Without the presence of these 2 bombshells, the film is a complete bomb. As a piece of film history, it has its place. As entertainment, it's atrocious, even for the time. Still, as I've said, it does have Mamie & Jayne! The male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent, although you can say that about a lot of modern films too. Only get this film if you're passionate about its 2 lusty blonde actresses. Otherwise, get a life+dvd
Dull Graveyard+N+Charles Band invites you into his Dull Graveyard...  This movie starts with a little girl playing with a bunch of dolls. She mistakenly bumps into a table and breaks a vase. Her father comes downstairs and decides to punish her by forcing her to bury her little buddies in a grave outside. She somehow trips and falls into the grave, killing herself. Dad buries the daughter with her beloved toys. Flash forward to thirty years later, a new family has moved into the house. The youngest son is a nerdy geek who likes to collect action figures. Imagine his joy at discovering a whole gaggle of antique dolls buried in his back yard! These dolls come to life and start protecting their new owner by killing everyone that ever picked on him. There are no spoilers here, I'm not giving away anything that isn't on the back of the DVD case.  Charles Band returns to what he knows best, making evil puppet horror movies. But just because this is what he knows best, doesn't mean he's any good at it. This is really just a reboot of Puppet Master and Demonic Toys with a new set of evil dolls. The production is shoddy, shot on a cheap DV camera with horrible lighting and a soundtrack that someone did on a Casio keyboard from 1982. Not to mention the fact that the puppets are the best actors in the movie.  Ever since Charles Band came out of retirement or hiding, the Blockbuster shelves have been graced with horrible Full Moon movies that are a few pegs below what they used to be. Even in his prime, Charles Band was nobody's genius, but time has definitely taken its toll. Titles like DECADENT EVIL, DOLL GRAVEYARD and THE GINGERDEAD MAN prove that you can't keep a hack director down. Band is back, folks.+dvd
Chaplin dvd was great!+P+I have always loved this movie and now I can watch it anytime+dvd
This Waiting Waiting Waiting is Tough+N+At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.  While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven."  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.  Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2 +dvd
*yawn* *waaaah*+N+I figured I would check this out, just for kicks, and I guess that the most important thing that I can say about it is that it was a waste of my precious time and I will never get it back :*(  I only wish there was a "zero stars" option.  But guess what? No matter how much I might disagree with Mr. Fleeger's views ("oh, and you know I do!"), I RESPECT his right to use his second Amendment rights!  I would never suggest anyone throw away, burn or otherwise destroy this product because I find what he has to say wrong, which I guess is the difference between liberals like myelf and so-called "conservatives" this product showcases getting angry because the chicks dared express their opinions.    I guess that it shouldn't be surprising that those who very likely couldn't explain what the second amendment is about to understand how important it is for people (such as the chicks!) to use them. +dvd
Trouble staying awake+N+Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake.+dvd
WC Fields+P+We enjoy all WC comedies. The packaging and the quality are amazing. We laughed often and the "you're Telling Me" was especially funny+dvd
stick with it+P+Losey's "The Servant" is a film you really have to stick with in order to get to the meat and potatoes.  It's almost like two movies in one.  It opens up innocently enough, with Dirk Bogarde (Hugo) coming to playboy Tony's (James Fox in a performance that oscillates between being mind numbingly annoying to heart rendingly pitiable) house, offering to be his servant.  From there it will take the viewer awhile to understand just how sinister and depraved Bogarde's Hugo is--for a good part of the film he just seems to be a confused, buffoonish servant trying to do his job.  From there things get really, really sick.  Co-dependency, class struggle, loneliness, alcoholism and finally madness dominate the house as Bogarde accomplishes a slick mastery of Tony's psyche and then his life.  He gets the weak minded and wealthy playboy to cheat on his fiancee, and then takes advantage of the ruins his life is left in afterward.  By the end of the film you know everything is screwed in a royal (no pun intended) way.  Sickness and betrayal crawl from every frame of the last half an hour, and the transformation the film undergoes is unbelievably well done.  You really don't know who to sympathize with, since the only character with a single intent and purpose is Tony's fiancee who quickly flees when the situation essentially becomes an orgy of broken minds and hearts.  This as good and creepily understated a film as Alfred Hitchcock ever made.   A must see. +dvd
who's the master, who's the servant?+P+Dirk Bogarde is great in this role!! Role reversal,(or was it role rectification?+dvd
Bad+N+While a good dvd by itself, its intentions are very bad. Most of the footage was stolen from several people who were planning to release it on a different dvd+dvd
This mob film has it all+P+Christopher Walken is a former organized crime figure that gets kidnapped by a group of preppies that hold him for ransom.  (This happens right up front in the story so I'm not giving anything away).  The kidnappers realistically come off as bungling amateurs.  Walken's presence is overwhelming (even duct taped to a chair) and he looms large over the whole story.  Great perfomance.  Throughout the film, the viewer keeps anticipating, "Somebody is going to really get hurt here".  They do, of course.  The story has plenty of mystery and multiple twists.  There are gruesome execution and mutilation scenes.  It has laugh out loud comedy - special mention to Denis Leary and his "stingray boots".  He plays a thug and is appropriately menacing and crude, but he is genuinely funny . . . even while brutally beating a man with a golf club.  The R rating is appropriate.  A well written and directed film.  Camera work a little unimaginative.  Good sound.   If you are OK with the violence, you are guaranteed an entertaining experience with this film.     +dvd
Blue Christmas+N+I'm a sucker for anything Christmas. I generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year, but come Christmas-time, I lap up these sappy movies. But even I couldn't stomach this one. The screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time I was watching it I wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a Christmas movie could be written and shot in 3 days that suckers like me would buy. What a waste of money & time+dvd
A Ton Of Fun  For Film Buffs+P+Since "The Fugitive" is one of my all-time favorites, this takeoff on it was a lot of fun for me to watch. Hey, sometimes it's best to laugh at ourselves and the things we like. For much of it, this movie was laugh-out-loud funny.  It helped not only to know "The Fugitive" story well but also "North By Northwest," "Casablanca" "Titantic," "Star Wars" and many, many other films, both classic and modern-day. The more familiar you are with movies, the more of these "inside" jokes are going to make you laugh. Being a movie buff, a lot of these gags connected and made me really have a good time watching this Leslie Nielsen farce.   Be warned, parents: this is not a family comedy. There are tons of sexual innuendos, so typical of today's comedies....but overall, this is really funny stuff and highly recommended if you watched a lot films in your lifetime+dvd
Wonderful, Vintage Christmas Memories+P+What a find! It's sad to think that this special was almost lost, but now it's here in COLOR.  For those of you who grew up in the 1950's, it's a wonderful trip down memory lane to a simpler time.  I do agree that Frank seems a little more tired than Bing, but both light up the screen with there take on some traditional Christmas carols.  I give this 4 stars because, as it is so blatantly mentioned in the extras, the restoration job done on this film is horrible!  But, I am at least thankful it exists and that we have the chance to enjoy it, even if it is not sparkling clear. *Note*  Careful observers will notice that a new copyright date has been digitally edited into the closing credits "MMI"  +dvd
Tape was of poor quality+N+Like the title states, the tape was of poor quality and skipped alot, making viewing difficult, and it is to much of a pain and just as costly to ship back.I do not recommend buying from this media distributer+dvd
Humor at it finest+P+Mike Myers is so silly, when you are in need of a laugh, Austin Powers is it. A good laugh is what the world is lacking today.+dvd
A  Beautiful Glimpse+P+This Dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world, and work, of John Santerineross, known as the leader in this genre, of art photography, he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books, "Fruit of The Secret God", and "Dream", he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces, and a short art film about a shocking subject(cutting), done very tenderly, so as not to shock.                                                                                                                    This little film, in spite of breath taking visuals, is not so much eye candy, as it is mind candy, leaving a hauntingly, bittersweet,  after taste on the tongue.  The images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements, presented through a dream like filter.  The sepia tone photography, evokes the feeling of, a memory,a strange familiarity, regarding our desires and fears.   His work is a wild roller coaster ride, which, thrills, and at times, terrifies, and leaves you wanting to "go again".        The images of women portrayed in this work,  are a refreshing respite from the mainstream images of women that, we are bombarded with daily in the media. Like REAL women, each image begs to be studied for content. The film itself is not long but is filled with so much information, so much to process, it is an epic in its own right.     I highly recommend any of John Santerineross's work, to lovers of neo- symbolist, art, photography, and erotica. To other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration.   +dvd
Required reading for anyone in the Internet biz+P+This film is a true classic - it captures a time, place, and mood with remarkable clarity, but moreover, it predicted the future with amazing prescience.    Everyone involved in the communications revolution should know about "TPC" and "Arlington Hewes". +dvd
Comedy For Paranoids+P+"The President's Analyst" is a pleasant surprise.  It's a consistently amusing cold-war comedy that lightly tweaks at everyone's most paranoid fears about espionage, government beauracracy, and monopolistic public utilities among other things.  Being the sixties, it also sends up suburban liberals, hippies, and yes, psycho-therapy.  James Coburn is brilliant as the analyst who finds that taking on the job as the President's analyst makes him the target of competing interests, some benevolent and some not so.  The movie really takes hold when his paranoia starts to set in.  Good supporting cast that includes Godfrey Cambridge as a U.S. spy and Severn Darden as an affable Soviet spy.  My favorite bit has to involve William Daniels as the gun-toting self-proclaimed suburban liberal+dvd
My Kids Love It+P+My 2 & 3 year old love this movie. They love to dance to the music. Garfield is so entertaining. This was a great buy.+dvd
French garbage+N+This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!    Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!  Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks!+dvd
Off the Formula But Still Disappointing+N+The Rebel-With-A-Heart-of-Gold-Who-Learns-The-Meaning-Of-Love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures, which were very popular in the movies and on TV at that time. The &quot;European&quot; setting got  Elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction  were basic, to say the least, and the music was uninspired and badly mixed  on record. The movie does have one of Presley's best set of opening  productiom numbers: &quot;Long Legged Girl..&quot; and others are rousing  tunes delivered with that Presley panache often missing from his late-'60s  efforts. But about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan  reaches for a magazine. An interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a  true &quot;discovery&quot; - an English teenager making her screen debut  with Elvis Presley! She handles the light-hearted assignment very well  indeed - even the &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; sequence which usually is  reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack  album cut+dvd
One of Elvis' worst movies+N+I've seen all of Elvis' movies, most several times.  This is one of the worst.  Only Stay Away Joe and Harem Scarem are worse.  I usually watch every Elvis movie every time it comes on TV, but not these three+dvd
Not for everyone+N+If your main objective, is the study of human relationships, social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing other people, this movie is for you.  Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just, a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script with people, relationships, seduction, etc.   This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true. Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others+dvd
Poor Sound & Episodes from Complete Season1+N+I thought that perhaps I was losing my hearing.  I looked (in vain) for subtitles to see if that would help.  My partner assured me that no, my hearing was fine, the audio on these DVD's is woeful.  Then I started to have episodes of deja vu.  Or maybe jkust episodes that were on The Complete Season One were included in this.  Huh?  Very strange.  I won't buy again until they do something about the audio.  It is headache enducing+dvd
Yes, I Remember When......+P+I am not familiar with Alan Jackson as I am not a country music afficianado but that does not mean I dislike country music. I think country music is wholesome, down to earth and I can relate to it very much. Not many songs on this DVD but the price is low so not much more can be expected. In my opinion "Remember When" is worth twice the price of the DVD itself. After you watch it you might cry (as I did) or kiss your wife or hug your kids. Beautiful, meaningful. You will not regret purchasing this DVD+dvd
My most watched film of all time!!!+P+Having been lucky enough to have seen and videotaped the original broadcast of Ric Burn's "Coney Island" way back in 1991 I found myself becoming more and more obsessed with this brilliant documentary. At the time I worked nights and would get home around 3 or 4 a.m. every night - most nights I would pop in my tape of "Coney Island" - I lived and breathed this film. It is everything the above review says it is and more. Anyone with a interest in history, immigration, carnivals, amusement parks, nostalgia, film and photography should definatley purchase this film. You will not regret it. Other titles from the amazing Ric Burns include " The Way West", " The Donner Party" " New York" as well as the epic "The Civil War" which he did with his brother Ken. As far as "Coney Island" goes you'd be nuts to pass this one up.+dvd
My favorite of the bunch+P+Many fans of the orignal Chainsaw Massacre would have me hanged for saying this, but The Beginning is my favorite of the entire lot.  It's a great prequel!  The movie is completely brutal and disgusting and even funny in some twisted ways.  Leatherface looks totally awesome and the family is even crazier than ever.  If you liked the TCM remake a few years ago, you'll love this new one. +dvd
Tales from Echo Park+P+At the end of my review of Director/Writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's first nationally distributed film, I wondered aloud as to what these talented, quirky guys would do after the fun, I only steal from the very best movies take on the Gay Porn Industry and the hangers-on that populate it,"The Fluffer." Well now I know: it's the very human, thoughtful and real "Quinceanera." Shot in a section of Los Angeles just 10 minutes from where I live yet on many levels worlds apart socially and ethnically, and reeling and rocking from the mixture of Mexican-Americans, who have lived there for many years and the Upscale Interlopers in the form of Non/Mexican Americans who go to Echo Park looking for homes that they can afford now that the Westside of Los Angeles is way beyond most peoples means. Glazer/Westmoreland's take on this Cultural and Monetary disparity is to step back, aim the camera and refuse to take sides: both the Inhabitants and the Interlopers are examined carefully and without judgment. The central story involves the impending Quinceanera (a sort of Bat Mitzvah) of Magdalena (a strong, fiery Emily Rios), her "miracle" pregnancy and Carlos (an angry, intelligent Jesse Garcia) who happens to be Gay which does not sit well with his father who promptly ejects Carlos from his home: both Mag and Carlos find acceptance and Love with their Great Uncle Tomas...the emotional center of his family and of this film, Chalo Gonzalez. "Quinceanera" is not a perfect film: the flaccid editing hurts the last third of the film but despite this, few  film scenes have as much emotional power and pack such a wallop as Carlos's ( and therefore, of course, Jesse Garcia's) eulogy at Tomas' grave-site, in front of a family that mostly despises him because he is Gay: it is on the one hand brave and on the other as heartbreaking and emotionally open and naked a scene as any committed to film in a long, long time.+dvd
Confusing, slow, and sub par acting+N+Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie.  The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short.  But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to.  Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me.   +dvd
timeless+P+I had seen Kraftwerk live in Ohio at the Agora when they came out with Computer World many years ago. I've been waiting for another chance at seeing them "live" and this is it! It's been worth the wait! This is muzik to get lost in, just close your eyes, lean back, and enjoy. :+dvd
Snoozalinga+N+I watched this dogg-o with some Japanese folks I know and let me tell ya all of thought it was the most boring, obvious, dated bore we'd laid eyes on in many a moon. And these guys are from a very wealthy, aristocratic, old Japanese family at the vanguard of Westernization in the 50s. STAY AWA+dvd
A Stirring WWII Film!+P+Dana Andrews is excellent as the Captain of a downed Army Air Corps B25 bomber over Japan. These US Flyers are captured and put on trial in a civilian court in front of the international press for suppossed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. The Japanese secretly torture the Airmen one by one trying to discover if they came from a land base or a carrier. The story basically revolves around whether or not the American Airmen will tell the Japanese what they want to know. The final minutes of the film are quite stirring. The film music master, Alfred Newman did the score for the film and cleverly chose not to use very much underscoring music until the final scene in the film. Although the music he uses is borrowed and not original his adaptation of it is powerful+dvd
Good short Power Yoga routine for building strength+P+First a few words about myself so you can more easily judge if my opinion might be helpful to you or not. I teach Power Vinyasa Yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I train every day and prefer complete Power Yoga Flow Routines that challange your overall bodystrength a lot and still contribute to every aspect of Yoga (meaning the meditative aspects, proper breathing, inner awareness and so on). Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that!  About the DVD: The routine is about 25 Minutes long but still offers you quite a challange for the short time. I can't do 60 to 90 Minutes of Yoga every day, so I'm glad to own a couple of shorter programms for the days in between or for early in the morning.  Rodney Yee is a hihgly skilled Instructor with a very gentil and calm manner and an interesting style of Yoga. His voice is always soothing, but still encouraging.   The programm on the DVD is specially challanging for upper body strength but still working the whole body. It's fluid and, regarding the short time, complete. The only one little thing I can critizise is that the verbal instruction is somtimes not absolutly in line with the instruction on screen. From time to time Rodny on screen is movin just a little to fast compared to his verbal instruction. But that's not very important and doesn't cause any problems, so I can still rate this 5 Stars. If your looking for a short physicaly demanding Power Yoga routine, this is for you. It's not suitable for absolute Beginners since Rodny moves pretty fast from Pose to Pose and some are to challanging for an absolute beginner. I would recommend it for intermediate to advanced students. If your interested in more Power Yoga, check out my other reviews about Power Vinyasa Yoga DVDs. To see al DVDs I recommend check out my listmania list. Let my know if you found the reviews helpfull. I truely hope so! Namast+dvd
I love to dance+N+I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!!+dvd
Not even worth illegally downloading!!!+N+Holy moley.  This thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose.  Even *if* you could get past the editing, there's the lighting. Even *if* you could get past the lighting, there's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video (even in the first scene, when the flute player didn't even come close to keying with the notes...and on and on and on).  Even *if* you got past the editing, lighting, and sync problems, you're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage.    No matter HOW good you think he is (and I do agree he's quite talented) it's obvious that Flatley thinks he's even better.  At the expense of the story, the cohesion, and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment, he's out to show how awesome he is.    Which tells me that other than dancing, he doesn't have a lot going for him.  He kind of reminds me of Mighty Mouse... chest puffed out... "Here I come to save the dayyyyyy!!!"  I'll tell you what to save... save your money, put it as the very very last item on your internet dvd rental queue, and hope you never get to it+dvd
Bottom of the Barrel+N+'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's.  I don't think this is entirely fair.  Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'.  But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy.  But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan.  So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time.  In some ways this film is slightly better than average.  The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary.  And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.)  The problem with this film is the zombies themselves.  Now,  I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film.  I don't care that they run,  and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget.  Don't care either  way.)  The problem is that they always use weapons and tools.  Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time.  For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people.  Not very zombie like.  Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough.  The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control.  These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads.  What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame.  They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME.  I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore.  The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads.  It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it.  There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up.  Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that.  The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks.  That was pretty sweet.  Yeah, that's it.  Amusing, but just barely.  Grade: D+dvd
Yawn+N+My main dispute with this Cinderella romance between young sisters and the conveniently available rich bachelor's from far away America -- it's rated R.  Why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping?  Teens love their romance, boy-girl breakups, and crush's.  This media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on --- let the kids have their childhood.   Oh, how many young sis' have coveted their older sister's boyfriends.  All of them! And that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed, but in 60 percent of American girls - the actual event begins with marriage. In this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love: the sisters want to marry up at any cost.  Is that a good lesson for teen gals?   Perhaps I'm not being fair on the philosophical side, but how about a believable story we can care about?  You won't find it in I Capture the Castle.  You'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene, the eccentric writer does his prison scene, the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene, and suddenly the guys show up like Price Charmings out of nowhere like we haven't seen that one before.  I'm sorry.  I think I'll take a nap.+dvd
Not So Good+N+This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags.  Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard.  Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of "The Incredible Journey," the one they only have on videotape+dvd
Worst DVD transfer I've ever seen.+N+Are you kidding me?  This is nothing more than a VHS to DVD transfer and it looks awful.  It's a complete travesty.  'Extreme Prejudice' is one of the most underrated action flicks of the late eighties.  A wonderful homage to Peckinpah that deserves better treatment than this piece of garbage.  Oh, and the cover art sucks too+dvd
Eddie Murphy makes it work: animal lovers will love this+P+Set in San Francisco and not England, the American Dr. Dolittle is just as comical as the original British vetrinarian in the 1960's muscial. When Dr. Dolittle's animal telepathic skills resurface he not only is sent to a mental institution but he ends up having to save a circus tiger's life. This California rendition complete with scenic shots of the Bay Area, is a departure from the children's books, but succeeds in its key message: either be yourself or nothing at all even if the mass population thinks you're crazy. Not being true to yourself is the direct route to driving you truly crazy+dvd
Beautiful pilates video you will do often+P+This pilates video stands out from the rest. The setting is a beautiful beach cove with the background audio of gentle waves, not music. After you heat up with the 100's and rest of the warm-up you almost feel like you are on that beach next to the instructor doing the routines. Other videos are often filmed in a stark unchanging studio and can get boring after a few times. The instructor has a nice smile and pleasing voice, and gives just the right amount of instruction and with the right tempo, making the exercises very easy to follow while always reminding you of your posture and breath. The routines  flow easily from pose to pose without unnecessary gaps or breaks. The first part is perfect for beginners, yet I found the second part challenging enough for an early intermediate level. Don't skip the intro, where the instructor does a nice job explaining what pilates is all about and how to intergrate it in your practice.  Since this video in enjoyable to do, I find myself practicing with  it often. I just returned from a snowboarding trip and felt improvements in my core strengh, balance and flexibility. I recommend it for beginners to early intermediates who want to enhance how they feel and how they perform in sports.+dvd
Enjoyable...+P+..it may seem simple..cheap cgi graphics and bad acting and uknown actors..but still the action in the movie is really good, from Africa to Roterdamn or however u spell it.. one notetable scene was the last scene, where Jackie Chan takes on 2 guys at the same time on top of a skyscraper..he kicks both their asses..after that he decides to jump off a steep part of the building...instead of using the elevator,,only JC can pull something off like that..i think this is prolly JC's last great film..in HK..i dint really like his U.S. features..the action in those was weak..and the fighting was jus.. really amtatuer, iguess he had to slow down in the american films..anyhow if u lookn for a good JC movie..go out and buy this one..it can rank with Supercop..Police Story 1 and 2..and project A..real good movie...2 thumbs u+dvd
Splendid!+P+It seems, as time goes on, Henley just gets better. With the eagles he came up with 'The Last Resort' possibly one of the prettiest use of chord sequences about and powerful words to accompany them. Then solo with classics 'The End Of The Innocence' and 'New York Minute' and now with what I regard the best two tracks on this album 'Goodbye To A River' and 'Damn It Rose'. The latter trying to convey the suicide of a close friend. What you hear is what you get with Henley. He has to be the finest vocalist 'live' I've encountered. As for his songwriting let me put it this way, I'd put him up next to Roger Waters with the way his songs always manage to move me. Shame they left the two best songs form the album off the DVD. Splendid work Mr Henley. Time to take another eleven year break it was worth the wait+dvd
turn it off+N+if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na+dvd
Romeo Must Live+P+First of all it has Aaliyah in it and for her first movie debut she  way over excelled in my opinion. The movie is seious yet it has comedic ways, which I love about it and the actors in it are great at bringing the movie alive, if any of them were to be replaced with someone else it wouldn't have been the same because they all made it their very own. Also the characters in it are very slick and the martial arts is cool, usally I don't care for martial arts movies, when I'm watching this I can't take my eyes of the screen. If you love comedy, martial arts, and romance you should check this movie out. Yet another thing to keep Aaliyah's beautiful legacy alive!!! R.I.P babygirl, fly high with your twenty two doves, you'll always be forever in my heart!!+dvd
Disappointing+N+Don't waste your time or your money on this film.  Trust the detailed negative reviews provided on this site.  I can only assume the positive comments were written by someone affiliated with the film to get their "star" rating up.  Could have been so good, the result was unfortunate+dvd
Awesome movie, lame HD DVD+N+The movie is awesome - 5 stars.  HD DVD transfer looks grainy (digital noise) and the colors are off and washed out. As crazy as it sounds, it looks worse then I remember it on VHS. Anyway, the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player.  Really dissapointing....+dvd
If you find another source...+N+If you find another source for this movie, pursue it! I liked the movie very much, and saw it first produced on Showtime Entertainment.  This copy appears to be burn made from someone's TV set.  Good movie for cheesy fun films, poor quality recording.+dvd
The other half of season 4+P+Since they decided to release SpongeBob season 4 in two volumes, this one will contain all the remaining episodes that weren't featured on volume one.  The episodes to be featured on this dvd will most likely be:  1.  Chimps Ahoy 2.  Whale Of A Birthday 3.  Karate Island 4.  All That Glitter 5.  New Leaf 6.  Once Bitten 7.  Bummer Vacation 8.  Wigstuck 9.  Squidtastic Voyage 10. That's No Lady 11. Best Day Ever 12. The Gift Of Gum 13. Rules Of Dumb 14. Driven To Tears 15. Burn To Be Wild 16. Squidwood 17. Best Frienenemies 18.

very good, for action fans+P+for those who like the martial arts movies and lots of action this is just the movie for you, Jet Li is remarkably skilled and very fast with his skill+dvd
Meh ... I've been there+N+I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever.  But, it failed to impress.  I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him.  I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much.  And my determination paid off!  *Patting myself on the back*  But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie.  The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either.  The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise+dvd
John LeCarre, BBC at Their Best+P+"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"the 1979 British Broadcasting Company's 6-part television serial is, of course, based on the masterful novel, of the same name, by British spymeister John LeCarre.  The novel, itself, was the first of LeCarre's Smiley-Karla trilogy, that ends with "Smiley's People."And, as the beneficiary of a first-class production by the BBC, "Tinker" achieves masterpiece status itself.  The series, adapted by the talented Arthur Hopcraft for the screen,  follows LeCarre's complex novel rather closely, giving us the intriguing plot developments,the well-rounded characters, and the witty dialogue.  Furthermore, the BBC hired some of the best available actors for the many principal roles, and surrounded them with all the extras, the cars, and the location shooting any viewer could wish.  The plot concerns George Smiley, forcibly retired, along with a number of his good-guy friends, from Britain's spy service, called "the circus" by Le Carre.  It is realized that there may be, within the spy service, a mole: a term created by leCarre himself to describe a person recruited in the past, and worked into a sensitive position, before being awakened to start reporting on his surroundings.  To, in this case, Smiley's opposite number, the feared Karla, chief of the ruthless Russian spy machine.  As it is realized that there is such a person working, and he is responsible for an unthinkably large amount of damage, including the deaths of several spy networks, and the dismissals of Smiley and friends, Smiley is drafted to locate him. But Smiley must work in secret, with only limited help from the official circus.   Alec Guiness plays Smiley with an instinctive understanding of the character that has seldom been bettered.  He is, as mentioned previously, surrounded by some of the best actors available: Bernard Hepton as Tobe Esterhase, chief of the go-to boys; Ian Richardson as the mysterious Bill Haydon, Ian Bannen as the victimized Jim Prideaux, Alexander Knox as Control.  Also Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Smiley's protege; Anthony Bate as Oliver Lacon, seasoned bureaucratic infighter; George Sewell as Inspector Mendel; Terence Rigby, and Michael Aldredge.  There's only one casting mis-step; Hywell Bennett as Ricky Tarr, the spy whose unthinking love affair, with a pretty Soviet agent, begins the unraveling of the circus's dark secret.  Bennett, who was the pretty-boy flavor of the month back then, simply cannot hold the screen with all these heavyweights.   It requires some patience, and full attention, to follow this intelligent series, that sometimes moves too slowly for American tastes, but those efforts are surely rewarded.  This series is John LeCarre, and the BBC, at their best. However, you might want to be sure you can watch it on successive nights, rather than as it was originally shown, on a weekly basis: it's a lot easier on the memory that way. +dvd
sloooooooooooooooow and booooooooorinnnnng+N+john le carre' novels are all crawled forward like snail. reading his novels are just like reading those novels of those written in 19th century. his novels about cold war were like a guy walked in a  dream, they have to be tolerated with extreme patience, because the blah, blah, blah sometimes would make you lose focus. this 3-dvd movie is just like his novels, so slow and so boring. i don't believe any reader under 30 years could read along with great enthusiasm, his novels are written for the folks wearing bi-focals sitting on the recliners. i do think if all the spies who were caught and then put in jail during the cold war, there are 3 ways to make them confess and sing like canary: 1) force them to read john le carre's cold war novels to bore themselves to death; 2) force them to watch these 3-dvd movies, smiley's people & tinker, tailor, soldier and spy; 3) force them to listen to the sound track of 'sound of music' 24/7. they'd be either gone crazy or hang themselves in their cells or, talk very soon :)+dvd
Enthralling+P+"Winged Migration" was shown on PBS not long ago. I set my VCR to tape it. Not having the time to check the length of the program, I had the VCR record it for one hour. As the tape played, I became totally enthralled by the majesty, strength, and beauty of the birds, the gorgeous photography, and perfectly accompanying music.  Then the taping cut off. The program had been one and one-half hours. I was missing the last half hour.  Far from being disappointed, however, it was a blessing in disguise. For this film is so extraordinary that a mere taping from cable doesn't do it justice and I decided to buy the DVD if available. I searched PBS; they didn't offer it. Next stop: Amazon. Sure enough, they had it, and it arrived two days ago.  The DVD is so magical I can't stop watching it. Plus my purchase helps support these wonderful people who created this tribute to the wonderful birds.  I have now returned to Amazon to buy *five* more as gifts. I know I will be giving family and friends a wonderful experience when I give them a DVD of "Winged Migration."  It is an experience not to be missed+dvd
Something strange !+P+This was one of my favorites when I was young and I can't wait to see it again ! Plus it has that cool song in it "Who you gonna call ? Ghostbusters !+dvd
The film you were not allowed to see!+P+Released my MGM--Metro Goldwyn-Mayer, October 24, 1962.   Rainy day: Pleasesee this film from beginning to the very end without any distraction or interruption.  This is a very important and wee-made film.   On DVD "Main Options", notice the card Frank Sinatra is holding.  Showing the back side and changing to Queen of Diamonds.   Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) has just returned from Korea.  At the airport is a grand fanfare put on by his head-strong mother (Angela Lansbury) whoose husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) is campaigning to be the next President in the White House.  Raymond despises his mother, but she has this "control" over him.  She also is handling her husband's campaign very closely even giving him cleverly the exact way to answer a question.   Meanwhile, Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has a dream that he and his other combat buddies are at a garden tea party meeting hosted by a Chairlady (Helen Kleeb, [The Waltons tv series]).  The dream changes to the men sitting at a seminar hosted by Dr. Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh).  Dr. Lo asks Raymond, while all are brainwashed, to kill Ed (Richard LePore). Major Marco suddenly wakes up screaming from his dream.  major Marco decides to investigate if his other soldiers are experiencing the same frightful dream.  Also in the cast: Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, James Edwards, Douglas Henderson, John McGiver, Jocelyn Jordan, Lloyd Corrigan, Joe Adams, Bess Flowers, Tom Lowell.  Academy Award Nominations: Best Supporting Actress, Angela Lansbury, Best Film Editing.  DVD is in full screen on one side, Wide-screen on the other side.   Audio Commentary by John Frankenheimer.   Special 1988 interview with Frank Sinatra, John Frankenheimer, George Axelrod.  Frank Sinatra pulled this film out of further release because of the assassination of our President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, November 22, 1963, as you will understand why after seeing this film all the wat through.  Kennedy's accused assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald who was then assassinated by Jack Ruby on his way to trial.  Oddly, their are references in this film to President Abraham Lincoln who was assassinated, April 14, 1865. Did Oswald see the film "The Manchurian Candidate"?   Frank Sinatra re-released this film in 1987.   Frank Sinatra personally chose Lucille Ball for the role of the mother, however the role ultimatly went to Angela Lansbury.   One source had the honor of seeing a "special exhibition" print and he swears this special print showed the big Queen of Diamonds costume with red over black.  This print is not available on VHS nor DVD.   This film was also re-released to pay-per-view television in 1987.   Terrible remake: The Manchurian Candidate (2004) with Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber.+dvd
Long, Boring+N+This was so long and drawn out. It took over 3 hours for this film to lay out what any crime show could have done on TV in an hour, including all the commercials. There were so many scenes that just went ON and ON - that's what they make DVDs for: to cut out long useless scenes to add to the "deleted scenes" special edition, so people who actually liked the movie can watch more of it, haha. acting wasn't even very good and not always very believable. just CHEESY. save yourselves 3 hours of your life.  also, i have no idea why one reviewer thought there was no sex. though it really wasn't as violent as most movies, still it's no family movie+dvd
Watch with your best girlfriend...+P+I took my best friend to see this (second run) in an small, artsy theatre in San Francisco.  It was so vivid and colorful... very interesting to watch.  I found myself following the storyline without having to focus solely on the subtitles.  As a result, I could appreciate the landscapes, the costumes, the hidden innuendos... all the first time around.  This movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship.  There is a scene near the end when the uppity, seemingly prudish Momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend, Ichigo that made us want to cheer.  As the end credits rolled, the small audience broke into applause.  Afterwards, we raved incessantly about how much we collectively loved it+dvd
How, why, what, huh?+N+I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm+dvd
Toooo beautiful for words+P+A must have. I enjoyed and loved ever minute. It does need widescreen. But that is the only flaw. "...And really Bad eggs, drink up me hearties Yo Ho!!!" This video is just at the end of standard definition and actually surpasses what SD can do. I really need the Hi def disk. I suggest buying both, this is that good. I LOVED every NANOSECOND of it+dvd
Four stars for originality...+P+...it is about a Comet that destroys all people who were exposed to it while it was passing through earth. Only a few survivors are left, and some who weren't directly exposed begin to turn into "zombie" like creatures. This is a fun 80's flick, with an original story. A good addition to your movie library+dvd
Enough with the Lions!+N+I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..+dvd
Oh, my, my...+P+It's obvious from reading so many of the reviews of 'Happy Feet', what's wrong with this country. Really, people...get a life!   It's a perfect reflection of our political climate, that a certain sector of the population is so wound-up, pent-up, angry, frustrated (and in so many ways), that they take it out on a bunch of harmless cartoon characters. I suppose this indicates that the angry rage over Tele-Tubbies has reached an end. My, this country has become a strange, dark place.   All that aside, I loved this movie, and can't think of a legitimate reason not to let your children see it. Smile...it won't break you.  +dvd
Simply Amazing! Christina at Her Best!+P+This Christmas Special is a must have if you're a Christina fan or if you think shes untalented give it a look to see just how talented she really is.  Not only does Christina sing her hit songs, "Genie in a Bottle," "What a Girl Wants," and "I Turn To You," she also sings some Christmas classics also on her christmas album, My Kind of Christmas.  Christina also sings some songs that aren't on her cds like "Climb Every Mountain," from The Sound of Music, one of Christina's favorite movies. Also included: "Alright Now," and Etta James' "At Last."  The Christmas songs she sings are "Merry Christmas Baby," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," and her song "Christmas Time," which is new on her Christmas cd, My Kind of Christmas.  Not only does Christina sing in english but she sings two of her Spanish songs "Contigo En La Distanica," and "Falsas Espernazas."  Special Guests: Lil Bow Wow, Brian McKnight, and Dr. John  Christina nails all of the songs on this dvd, its absolutely amazing, defenitely worth a watch and better then her previous dvd Genie Gets Her Wish+dvd
not 141 minutes and where the ----- is the music?????+N+A huge disappointment. First, there is only a documentary of 50 something minutes... just talk and talk and snapshots of people and the events... Then, a 10 min montage, more interviews and... where is the music?? Aweful..+dvd
One of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...+P+In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped "The Day the Earth Stood Still" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gort--the prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force... Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since...  In "Devil Girl from Mars," the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal...   In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.'   The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor...  Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy...   Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly...   Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!'   Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had...  Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...  +dvd
Watch it for the Fonz and Kathy Bates performances+P+This movie reminded me of a spoof of 'Forrest Gump'. I have no idea if it was intended that or not. I choose to look at it that way because that is the only way that this could ever possibly be funny. However, the real jokes are that Tom Hanks took the same material and impressed critics and audiences with his acting skills while Adam Sandler just amused a few people who watched this film. The other joke in the film is Adam Sandler's voice. He kept changing it. First, he had a mild southern accent, then he just began talking slower and faking a stutter. Regardless, I got a slight chuckle from the idea of him trying to fake a voice to sound stupid. His real voice would have fit all too perfectly+dvd
My favorite comedy movie of all time +P+This homage to Alfred Hitchcock is a work of genius. The shower scene in this movie remains one of the best parodies ever. Madeline Kahn's role is one of her best and Cloris Leachman looks as if she enjoyed playing her character. The casting in this movie is inspired.+dvd
Must have for the KC fan!+P+I loved the videos on this DVD although I too could have done without the fan footage. However, if you are a Kenny Chesney fan, I think you definitley would want this for your collection+dvd
what a joke...+N+this is supposed to be entertainment? well,wait...yeah, it is...comedy! what a joke to think anyone with half a budweiser soaked brain thinks this guy has an ounce of talent...people that like this stuff probably are the same people who like Tim McGraw,Toby Keith and the like...if you ask them &quot;who has more talent, the eagles or Kenny Chesney?&quot; their likely answer would be the latter...what are they putting in that there budweiser lately? must be some kinda mind numbing stuff to make people think this waste of space- poor excuse for a human being and even sorrier excuse for a musician could even stand in the same room with a legend like the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac...it's really sad to see the music industry fall to this low a level...speaking of Fleetwood Mac, has anyone heard the awful rendition of &quot;Landslide&quot; by the Dixie Chicks? sounds like someone scratching the chalkboard to me...check out the original,and judge yourself...if you know what talent is when you hear it..+dvd
Amazing for Adults and Children+P+What a great lesson in perserverance--kids will be eager to create their own works of art in the backyard.  Andy is amazing and this DVD is pure beauty+dvd
Legends Of The Dull+N+More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff+dvd
Hilarious, True and Funny+P+Anybody who has ever worked in any service industry should and can appreciate this movie....As a Floor Capitan in an above average resturant I would have sworn they filmed it in my establishment at times....As I watched - I saw so many people that fit the characters in the movie in my own place....As the saying goes on the box - "Never upset anybody who comes in contact with your food!"  This goes along with what my own father told me when we first came to the USA. People get off your cell phones and watch this hilarious movie+dvd
This is an excuciatingly dull, BAD movie+N+As a lover of film noir and proud owner of most that are on DVD or VHS, I can say without hesitation that this is one of the very worst ever. The only reason I gave it two stars, instead of one, was because of the fine performers who were saddled with this inane script.  Joe Ferrer's hypnosis of Gene Tierney to allow her to sleep is nothing compared to the yawns brought about by the agonizingly slow pace, lack of action, and interminable pauses between lines. At one point, Gene Tierney swears that she hasn't been lying, and you find yourself wanting to respond: "Of course, you haven't. You haven't said anything of import."  The storyline makes absolutely no sense. Jose Ferrer has set up the perfect crime so what does he do? He returns to the scene for no apparent reason other than to be captured. He hypnotizes Gene Tierney to steal incriminating evidence and then has her place the items where they will inexorably be discovered.  A complete waste of wonderful performers. Cross this one off the list, and donate the $9.99 to your favorite charity. Or pourchase "The Dark Corner," a truly memorable Fox noir with an outstanding performance by a breathtakingly gorgeous Lucille Ball+dvd
Star Wars+P+Come on, if you are looking to get this, do it....it is STAR WARS after all!!  Everyone either loves it or hates it.  no in between, if you like Star Wars then add this to your collection, if you do not like Star Wars, go away - look for something else------you will not fit in here+dvd
I saw this with a Holocaust survivor+N+We enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor, but my friend, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and a forced labor camp, was finally outraged by this treatment of the Holocaust, as was I. A child in Auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience! My friend would have been gassed to death, because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp. Watch Divided We Fall instead! Or for a very good depiction of life in the camps, watch Fateless or The Grey Zone+dvd
Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel?+N+If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them.  This movie was not scary.  It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters.  You know what the best part was?  When it was over.  Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad.  This one obviously did+dvd
These cats just lip sing....+N+I'm a huge Bone fan and I expected a great DVD and it has many performances but the catch is that THEY LIP SING on all there performances.  So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them.  The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference.  But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap.  If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star.  And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically.  So even if your a huge Bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned...+dvd
I'm so excited I literally feel like I'm going to fall over and die.+P+My anticipation is so great that I can hardly contain myself. I'm counting down the days, no, the minutes till it arrives at my doorstep. When it does, I fear that I just may very well keel over with a heart attack and die I won't be able to stand it. I can only hope my poor heart will hold out long enough for me to actually watch the movies. I will be so happy then. +dvd
Gilmore Girls fans beware!+N+this season gets WAY too soap opera for my family's taste, but maybe thats just us. I just wish they had kept it simpler like it was in the beginning+dvd
Peter Sellers is once again excellent+P+With every new Pink Panther Movie, Peter Sellers' performance continues to grow and mature. I've seen this move at least 7-8 times so far. It's definitely a classic.  Lots of good laughs.  My other favorites: Matrix Series (Christian Mysticism & Symbolism) V for Vendetta () Harry Potter Series Underworld (war between the Vampires and Lycan) (Mythology, Symbolism, "Collective Unconsciousness" as per Carl Jung's work)  P.S. Peter Sellers as Insp Clouseau is quintessential Virgo+dvd
Hauntingly Beautiful, a Must-See for those who judge a movie by its screenplay+P+The creators of this film had no ceilings on their vision of what they could bring to life when tackling the process of transforming the depths of the screenplay into the heights of a multidimensional cinematic experience. If you can see this on a big screen, do it. With shades of "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover," Tarsem Singh, the director, has fashioned his genius with his crew's technical refinement.   The movie itself is worth owning for the following reasons: Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio on the same screen at the same time, two great actors in two great roles; Jennifer Lopez way outside the box -- JLo only peaks out three times when her accent creeps back in on a few words; the stunning visuals and special effects rival only those of "What Dreams May Come;" this is Tarsem Singh's directorial debut and it displays the mastery of his vocation; and finally, the screenplay itself would have made a fascinating plot line under any direction, but auspiciously came to life under the wing of Tarsem Singh.  Warning: Plot Spoilers ahead. Jennifer Lopez is a psychologist who uses breakthrough neurological technology to enter the subconscious mind of a comatose child and then that of a serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. However, she has never tried "reversing the feed," which involves bringing the other person into her subconscious mind because of the emotional dangers of such a mind merge. The highlight of the entire movie is when, against the will of her superiors, she decides to do this anyway and brings the killer into her own world where he appears as his little boy self. The incredible battle she must wage between bestowing Compassion for the torture he endured from his father in childhood and delivering Justice for the torture he has inflicted on innocent women as an adult comes climactically to fruition in a sequence of tragically requested and tragically rendered Mercy. The terrible beauty of the death of suffering is brilliantly written, acted, directed and produced in a denoument that is priceless and at the very least worth the cost of the DVD.  Vincent D'Onofrio is a gift to the screen and Tarsem Singh a gift to both actor and audience. Enjoy this film even more the second time for its exploration of innocence versus experience, mercy versus justice, and life versus death+dvd
A Hard Lesson+P+The thing that we in our time fail at is to disapprove of someone for the right reasons. The true historical significance of Hitler and the Nazis is not well known. An earlier reviewer ntioned that Germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the Nazis started to vie for power. This cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that Hitler repaired Germany's economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought Germany to the forefront of world power. What is not understood is the true threat that Hitler posed. The 25 Points of the National Aryan Socialist Party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve. Number 11 clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking; and felt that it was crippling Europe's economy. Of course they blamed the Jews: but this broad-stroke was clearly one of Hitler's failures. What is significant is that once Hitler declared this; the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them. Any nation who seeks economic autonomy cannot be tolerated. In fact, almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely busines deals gone sour. Hitler never wanted war with England. It was in Churchil's interests to instigate war, owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite. Having said that, there is the quality of the nation-state, and its upliftment wherein Hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer. He was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims. He wa sthe first human being to appear on a public TV broadcast, he used radio and TV and in this case, cinema, to great effect. The holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide (unfortunately, not the last). Watching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion: and in human psychology. There was, within Hitler and his methods, a cynicism concerning the general state of the people. Consider the following quotes: "I reserve reason for the few, and emotion for the many" "If I approached my audiences with reasoned arguments, they wouldn't understand me. Their intelligence is small. I must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which I repeat over and over again, until my words become like commands under hypnosis" This is the general opinion he had of the majority of people. And if you examine any modern politician's speeches, they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences. Ms. Reinfenstahl's brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner. Hitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny; and his techniques have proven effective - especially when his obvious mistakes are avoided. He was just too obvious. Too much ego. To little hypocracy.  We can't say we weren't warned+dvd
A convincing vision of Hitler in Hell+P+The great 18th century mystic Swedenborg, who claimed prolonged visions of Heaven and Hell, reported that souls in Hell don't know they're in Hell because they're behaving as they did in life; the angels, however, look upon them and see them as terrible beasts.  As I watched this profoundly engrossing film, I had no doubt by its end that it's not just an artistic &quot;turn&quot; dealing with Hitler's psyche, image, and horrific legacy but instead is a powerful portrayal of him in Hell.  Hell for Hitler may well be eternal self-absorption and facile self-analysis punctuated by the rare inkling of consequences of his acts and awareness of the reality of others--sporadic insights that reduce him to befuddled torment and (his worst nightmare) weakness.  The actors' portral of Hitler and Goebbels are brilliant, and the film itself left me shaken.  It seemed not so much an artifice as a true vision of Hell+dvd
Fine biography of famed French scientist+P+This MGM-produced biography of French scientist Marie Curie is produced with the usual studio gloss.  Film drags at times and presumambly plays fast and loose with the facts, but still worth a look, especially for great  teaming of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, who has some of his best  moments here; his proposal scene is classic+dvd
A terrific li'l album that evokes a fun period and flick+P+For those of us who came of age when "Urban Cowboy" introduced John Travolta to the world in his third iconic dance-man starring role (after Saturday Night Fever and Grease) in a productive three-year period, this soundtrack is an essential. We're all familiar with the big hits that populated this disc and dominated Top 40 radio in the early '80s, but I'd buy it solely for the haunting duet by Linda Ronstadt and J.D. Souther, "Hearts Against the Wind," that closes the show+dvd
Jumbled+N+I wasn't expecting much from Pulse, and with such low expectations, I wasn't disappointed. It was everything a one- or two-star movie could hope to be.  What I did find disappointing was that they had a good idea somewhere, but everyone working on the film, top down, seemed to miss it. Then again, it was a remake of a Japanese horror classic (and Japanese horror films rarely, if ever, make sense), so they weren't trying to find an original story. Pity.  In an otherwise quiet college town, the suicide rate is skyrocketing. Eventually our heroes, Mattie (Kristen bell) and Dexter (Ian Somerhalder) realize that there is a virus, of sorts, in "the system", and odd, silvery specter-like creatures are the cause of it. These creatures, never explained, put themselves face-to-face with their victims and then it seems that they inhale and suck some essence from their victim, which feeds them - somehow. It makes for good viewing, but it doesn't make much sense. And because it doesn't make sense, we're not "creeped-out".  Since I'm reviewing this as the DVD, and not the film, I'm giving it two-stars - because for the first time that I can recall, the special features were subtitled. As I'm hearing impaired, I normally miss out on the special features, and even though these special features weren't all that exciting, I was able to watch them. +dvd
A Stinky Turd+N+My God, this is one sloppy mess of a movie.  Jet Li should be ashamed of this putrid turd.  Even the great fight choreographer, Cory Yuen, cannot escape being associated with this film untarnished.  The story is dumb, but so what.  The acting is dumb, but so what.  The pathetic attempts at comedy fail abysmally, but so what.  This is a martial arts film; we watch these films for the fight scenes, right? Uh-huh.  Unfortunately, the fight scenes suck too, big time.  The scene where Jet takes on the UFC guys is embarrassingly bad, and the MUCH anticipated fight between Jet Li and the great Mark Dacascos is a HUGE let down.  Someone needs to tell editors that cutting back and forth between several action scenes absolutely ruins the flow and impact of ALL OF THEM! (This is the same bad decision that has ruined the climax of so many of the Star Wars films, but in this case, all of the action scenes going on are downright awful.)  Further, DMX is just plain silly, and his nice-guy act in the film does not mesh with the meaning of the lyrics of his songs that accompany some of his character's actions on screen.  Similarly, I wonder what Jet would say about some of the lyrics to some of the crap rap songs in this film, such as the violent and hateful opening song featuring the whiny, smarmy voice of Eminem--Jet is supposedly a devout Buddhist, after all, who is very opposed to violence.  All-in-all, this is one big stinking mess of a film.  Even as BAD martial arts films go, this one has little-to-no entertainment value whatsoever at all.  It's so bad that Exit Wounds stands far above it! Watch Unleashed or Kiss of the Dragon instead, both of which are infinitely superior to this steaming pile of dog crap+dvd
Rhymes with "Lame"+N+This paint-by-numbers New Zealand film is a rote Coming-of-Age / Adultery flick in which a family living by the seaside is put in moral jeopardy by a handsome stranger. Throughout the film, I kept asking myself how the parents in this nuclear unit could spend so much time at their dream house without working a steady job. Instead, it appears that everyone involved has far too much time on their hands and found that drinking themselves into oblivion will only do so much to ease the boredom.  Yes, Mom (Sarah Perise) has a booze problem and the hots for the boat-bound stranger (Marton Csokas). Meanwhile, Dad (Alistair Browning) sits cuckolded in the back yard sipping hard liquor. Their two kids (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki and Aaron Murphy) don't have healthy hobbies either; spending their time cutting private parts out of porn magazines and taping them to their bodies. I suppose there is a lot of "higher meaning" going on between these "adult parts" and the lemon tree that grows in their back yard. However, I really wasn't inclined to dig deep in this overly glossy film whose plot and ending were visible from the onset.  Director Jeffs muddies her water with an overabundance of slow motion shots, drawing out the tedium of RAIN. Instead of treading new ground, the film provides the audience with trite morality and one-dimensional characters+dvd
Killer Action & Comedy!+P+Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a suburban couple who live in a large and beautiful house on a quiet street, have been keeping a rather large secret from one another - they are both actually assassins working for rival organizations.  When the two are sent on the same job and unexpectedly discover the true nature of their respective professions, they wage war on each other, which eventually destroys the not so happy home they've been trying so hard to maintain. However, when it becomes clear that their bosses want them eliminated, they realize they have to turn to each other.  Overall, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a mixture of very dark comedy and some well put together action sequences that deliver a well rounded movie going experience, but, there's some definite flaws here - some common sense issues, not to mention that there's no real villain  - but the battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie - verbal and otherwise - manages to carry the picture to it's conclusion+dvd

THE WORST DVD EVER  IN A HUNDRED YEARS+N+IT'S BRITNEY SO IT IS AWFUL,VAPID,PUNGENT,REVOLTING,TERRIBLE AND YUCKY.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HAVE THIS DISGRACEFUL BRITNEY DVD YOU SHOULD BE SLAPPED.A TRUE MUSIC FAN WOULD AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.GET ANY DVD FROM QUEEN INSTEAD.ZERO STARS+dvd
Very good historical drama+P+Good role for Crowe, well directed and appears to be fairly accurate of Roman Empire lif+dvd
Awful+N+I was very disappointed in this movie.  It had such cool cover art on the DVD that I took a chance and rented it - foolish move.  It just isn't scary.  It is a typical slasher type film, but with no scares, storyline, etc..    I watch many, many movies and can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the top 5 worst movies I've seen.  I highly recommend staying clear of this movie+dvd
Not really bad but could've been a lot better+N+The series' main flaw is the repetetiveness of the storylines, somehow even though I watched the episodes back-to-back I still felt deja-vu. The plot wouldn't advance for episodes, and I think this is what caused the ratings to plummet, they took too long to flesh out the plot so, the fans grew bored. Also, what contributed to my feelings was the showing of several identical slides in every episode! That said, it still was a fun watch, the bonds shared by the twins, Chobi, Lisa, and the enigmatic Kaze are really interesting and often funny(when not pertaining to Kaze of course). Also, the villians were not malevoloent, just mischevious which only served to affirm my opinion that this anime is more oriented towards kids. I'm not sure about the mechanism used to rate if it's final fantasy or not, but I think the fact that they had crammed all the plot twists in the last episode contributed to the criticisms, I think if the animators took some of the sub-plots out and focused on the storyline this series would've been good, instead of just decent. As it is, it's still fun, and at a bargain price; if you have nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it!(2.5 stars+dvd
Great Classic Needs New Transfer Badly+N+There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic.  There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905).  The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format.  If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release.  A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all.  Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen.  None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable+dvd
Read the book - it takes less time!+N+The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film+dvd
Kundera was right to object+N+The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society+dvd
Explores the "unknown"  American Revolution on the Frontier+P+This is a great movie that just gets better with the years. Released in 1939 it had to compete with "Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz", so it ran a little under the radar. When it comes to the Revolutionary War 99% of people think Gen. Washington at Valley Forge, Brandywine and the climatic battle at Yorktown VA. Maybe more interesting and just as important was the war that was fought on the American Frontier. That is the subject of this movie and it is done well. A boyish Henry Fonda plays Gil Martin and Claudette Colbert (who received top billing over Fonda) stars as his wife, Lana. Clothing and props are authentic as well as the flintlock rifles that are used. John Carridine does a great job as "Caldwell", the Loyalist leader of the Indian forces that attack the "whig" settlers.  Best of all it has been digitally remastered and looks better than ever. A special features section explains how this was done. It is good to finally see this movie on DVD and it should be in the library of everyone who enjoys historically based movies+dvd
Fantastic Movie+P+A true masterpiece of cinema.  This film not only showcases some of the best sound work done ever in film history, but showcases a true character perspective masterpiece.  The way it is shot and the way it is stylized goes incredibly well with the plot and storyline and everything meshes incredibly well to the point where you become completely immersed with it and forget your watching a movie+dvd
Okay, not a barn burner though+N+Interesting movie, little short on the story line, some of the actors were not as believable as they could have been (the native americans), the romantic scenes were over emphasized, ...I love the period in history, is the only reason I remotely like the movie+dvd
It is the exeption, not the rule, bad example+N+The documentary is one of the few that Fidel Castro will allow to show on the communist Cuban television. It shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants. Completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about Cubans. No a good example. The director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered. The other ninety percent of the rafter or Balseros, not showed on this documentary of course, are mostly white, blue collar worker, professionals, and artists. I see then all the time. Why this documentary doesn't show to the world that Cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government. Balseros that came here to work hard, learn the language, make money without selling drugs. It is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware Che Gevara tee-shirt. I am sorry about my English, I am just a Balsero that came here eight years ago and now I am American citizen, own a hause,  have my own insurance business and most at all, I am free and proud to be a cuban balsero+dvd
I didn't like it AT ALL!+N+I found the characters stilted and unbelievable.  These are supposed to be "REAL" people? It is just my opinion but my copy goes up for sale today+dvd
chopped and ruined+N+anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft.  in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the "best" scenes if you get my drift.  if you want to see the original film this is not it.  avoid at all costs+dvd
Bad one for Charlie+N+Charles Bronson is one of my favorites, but VIOLENT CITY is example of 70's trash at it's worst. Boring slow pacing and a "see-saw" action that gets old really fast. Bronson's character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself.  I love Charles Bronson... but this is one of his dud films +dvd
Some of the best movies I have ever watched+P+Each movie of the collection is a masterpiece, a refreshing experience, leaving a deep, intense after-taste. Do not miss them +dvd
Paradise NOT Uncut+N+Several images are blurred out.  Do not purchase this unless you want a censored version.  The VHS version from Astro Video is uncut with no images blurred and has the original music+dvd
AWESOME!!!+P+The title says it all!!!  I cannot stop watching this DVD.  I think the music is phenomenal.  I only wish it were longer, and every playoff game becomes available at some point. +dvd
Shame on Showzen+N+For an incredibly amazing, hilarious show, it is a shame that something that is normally closed-captioned when aired on television is not really captioned when released to DVD. Amazon says it is closed captioned, but there is nothing on the DVD box that indicates it is. Using this information, I went ahead and purchased it anyway, only to find out it was not at all. Who is really at fault I don't know, and yes I am definately bitter+dvd
A good piece of work+P+Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work+dvd
Tha Flight of the Intruder+P+The best air combat movie ever seen. Almost perfect +dvd
So bad it's hilarious!+N+A puerile, manipulative plot in the manner of Spike Lee on a bad day, a director with a sub-median IQ who doesn't have a clue regarding how real people behave, scenery-chewing actors who rival the worst of William Shatner, not a single role to inspire sympathy or empathy. What does it all mean? A couple hours of my life down the drain. But add a tank of nitrous oxide, and you just might have a great time. This one tops my previous pick for worst movie on cable, which was "Cellular.+dvd
Lang's triumphant talkie debut+P+This film is easily in the Top 5 of Fritz Lang's best films, and quite possibly his #1 best sound film as well.  In addition to being Lang's debut sound film, it was also Germany's very first sound film, and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures.  Almost every sound film from the late Twenties and very early Thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter, as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true "motion pictures."  But by 1931, a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out, and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece.  And unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound, Lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence.  He knew that the actors didn't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching.  Of course, the director is only one part of the film's genius; the actors are brilliant too, in particular Peter Lorre, who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role.  The film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre, what with the terrific shadows, lighting, and suspenseful mood and atmosphere.  The film does start out a little slowly, but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling.  The plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it.  Lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well, and this film is no exception.  A child murderer is on the loose, and with no answers in sight, the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty, particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals.  The people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations, and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves, but to do it all without any help from the police, who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to.  Even criminals have standards; it's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by "ordinary" criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did.  When the criminals finally track down Hans Beckert, the murderer, at a warehouse, they tie up the night watchmen so they won't alert the police, so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves, even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there.  The final section of the film, in the criminals' kangaroo court, is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film.  One starts out feeling repugnance at this menace, this person who molests and kills children, but by the time the film is up, one can't help but feel sorry for him, or at least see him as a human being.  We never see him hurting children, and don't even see his face right away.  He's not shown as a monster or an evil person; indeed, who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer?  The treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era.  While what he's done isn't being excused or apologised for, he's ultimately shown to be a victim himself, a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him, doing these horrible horrible things because of it, only finding peace when he's committing these criminal acts.  Is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle, people who could have become bank tellers, teachers, or doctors, people who had a choice because they didn't have this monster constantly following them?  This must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931, when many people blamed people like Beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it, when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control.  It's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it, and only gets better with multiple viewings.  Extras include audio commentary, an interview with Fritz Lang a year before his death (once again he tells the  tall tale of his meeting with Goebbels and how he left Germany late at night with barely any money, never to return until after WWII, even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture!), the mini-documentary 'A Physical History of M,' a gallery of pictures, stills, and drawings, an interview with Harold Nebenzal (son of producer Seymour Nebenzal), a ten-minute version of 'M' made by Claude Chabrol, and excerpts from discussions editor Paul Falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film.  Overall, this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history; one can't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it.  This film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film, instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it's great or if it's just overrated+dvd
[poor] and pretentious+N+This film is about a female student at Randolph University in Alabama in the early 60's who is a writer for the school newspaper.  She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement.  It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing.  A much, much better movie on this theme is The Long Walk Home and also The Ghosts of Mississippi+dvd
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU NEVER SEE THIS!!!!!+N+I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen!+dvd
Incredible+P+Wow.What a series.It tackles all types of uncannily real situations and people.This is a real human show and left me feeling the entire gamma of feelings:crying,laughing,anger,etc.I love the family represented in six feet under and find myself talking about them and their situations with my girlfriend as if they were real people.This show reflects life so well.If you haven't watched this yet you are in for a treat.I'm saving up for the complete series.I found that we had to ration ourselves to 2 episodes a night so it would last.I love the Fishers and Keith...and Brenda...6fu is the best series of them all and I'm an owner and big fan of Deadwood,24,The Sopranos,Curb your Enthusiasm+dvd
Ennui would be a kind descriptor+N+Clocking in at just under two hours, I LOVE YOUR WORK leaves the viewer feeling as though from the opening sequence that stones have been tied to your feet and your body thrown into the very deep and dank water to slowly settle into the mud at the bottom.  Sound dreary? Then avoid this little mess of a film.  It is hard to believe that Adrian Butchart who is giving us the radiant GOAL! THE DREAM BEGINS trilogy could help write this script: one wonders if writer/director Adam Goldberg didn't just bring him in for help.  The story is tired (small time guy gives up love for a career as a movie star with all the accessories of money, fame, celeb status, gorgeous wife, etc. only to find life in its simpler fashion was preferable) and the choices of casting this very dark and dreary tale are inappropriate.  Giovanni Ribisi, superb an actor though he most assuredly is, simply is not credible as a movie star sex symbol whose stardom is accompanied by alcoholism, self hate, paranoia, fragmented thinking, and bad decisions.  The only time we see anything vaguely suggestive of his ability to create a role is in the many flashback scenes (with girlfriend Christina Ricci): his on screen chemistry with his famous wife Mia (the enormously talented Franka Potente who here is wasted in a mannequin's role) is nil, and his interplay with such actors as Vince Vaughn, Marisa Coughlan, Judy Greer, Shalom Harlow, Joshua Jackson,  Jason Lee, and Elvis Costello is unilateral.  Goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner of artsy camera tricks that only serve to make the tedium increase.  With a cast like this the product had promise.  Goldberg needs some time to think about this phase of his career.  Grady Harp, November 06+dvd
Great Language Features+N+Band Camp was funny, but not as good as the first two American Pie movies. It was, however, on par with the third movie in the series. There were the usual silly, outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies, but not the main characters. This movie was fun and worth watching, but probably not really worth watching again EXCEPT for the the language features. The movie comes dubbed in Spanish and French, plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language. SO, this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills+dvd
Leon+P+Cannot rate this film high enough. It is in my top 5 films of all time!  The acting is fantastic, the story gripping, the action feels real, and then you have the wonderful Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, if you don't see this film, it is your loss+dvd
Caution - May be dangerous to your health!+P+When Darkwing Duck first aired on television, I was recuperating from a broken back and on some really good meds.  I laughed so hard that I nearly did myself another injury.  Now the first season is available on DVD, and I am here to tell you that even without the meds, Darkwing is still hilarious.  My youngest granddaughter and I have watched them all, together, and she loves to "get dangerous." +dvd
Dont like the banners+N+I bought this for projection shows for the visuals only and though it has some cool visuals, it also has on screen titles & banners that ruin the visuals+dvd
Great companion to the CD+P+If you Love Daryl Hall & John Oates, you will love this new DVD!   Daryl, John & the band singing live all the songs from their latest CD Our Kind of Soul.  They are great recorded, but unbelievable performing live!   Rock Steady is a great up beat tune, and the sad, but beautiful Neither One of Us is very poignant.   Due to the multi layered nuances of After The Dance, this will probably be the only time you will see this great, haunting song sung live by Hall & Oates.  +dvd
Hitchcock has done better+N+Don't let the title fool you as it did me.  For whatever reason, I led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion Rear Window takes place all within one location.  It doesn't, but part of me wished it had.  As far as the plot goes, two strangers meet on a train.  Guy, a pro tennis star, and Bruno, a psychotic socialite.  He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father.  Part of this felt very Throw Mama From the Train to me, but more funny.  Anyway, I have come to expect great things, and high tension from Hitchcock, and sorry to say, he didn't deliver this time around.  The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get.  His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey.  If they were to remake this movie (and as much as I despise remakes, I believe they are planning one), they'd be foolish not to offer it to him.  So for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices+dvd
The Yankees dont come up to scatch+N+This is a poor production when compared to the Ken Burn's masterpiece "Baseball".  Only for the deeply committed Yankee fans. It may be accurate but it isn't  "history+dvd
WORST EVER!+N+Wow E! must have the best editors in the world! I must have REALLY forgotten what the show was like, but i do remember liking it. However the DVD version is soo slow and there are many, many scenes where no one has anything to say to each other. Not the fun show i remember at all. Bobby Trendy is actually the funny one here. Anna is beautiful and fun and Howard is like the guy you can't stand but can't get rid of. Is he really an attorney? wo+dvd
BLOWN AWAY GOOD!+P+OK, so let's talk about the MUSIC and the performance on this Eagles concert HD-DVD. NOTHING BUT AWESOME! Just what I'd expect from these boys.  Twenty-five, or so, songs, performed live with studio-quality sound perfection and  singular performances by each and every member of this beloved American band! The HD-DVD cinematography, lighting, and color is beautiful - almost better than being there.  Pretty much all of the songs you remember and love the eagles for; ya know - Hotel California, Tequilla Sunrise, Take it Easy, .... etc. Some new stuff as well. Joe Walsh sings a good new upbeat tune about zoning through his earlier life due to alcohol. Lots of fun, big excited audience, great horn section, superb backup drummer, guitarist, keyboards.  My only complaint is about the direction with respect to guitar playing - I really wanted to see more about how Walsh and their other awesome guy (don't know his name) made those awesome sounds. Oh well.  Now, about HD-DVD players: I got the XBox 360 HD-DVD add-on. It was sub-standard, IMO. I returned it and got the real deal Toshiba stand-alone HD-DVD player with the independent analog audio inputs (you've got to get the analog surround inputs if you want to really experience HD-DVD sound on the recent Toshiba players). So get real and get a dedicated HD-DVD player and CHECK OUT THOSE EAGLES!  I have a 100" screen front projection HD projector, 1200 Watt pioneer sound box, and about $3000 worth of full size 7.1 surround speakers. It rally gets me in the "zone." But you don't need this much equipment to enjoy this great Eagles HD-DVD - just a dedicated HD-DVD player. BTW, if you love music, only the HD-DVD standard REQUIRES technically superior sound on each and every HD-DVD released - not so on Blu-Ray. So go HD-DVD+dvd
BZZZzzzzzzzzzz...+P+&quot;The Fly&quot; is a well made / known sci-fi classic. Andre (David Hedison) is a scientist, working on a contraption that disintegrates solid matter, sending it to another location to be re-integrated. Andre wants to develop it for the good of mankind, but that would make for one dull movie! Instead, he accidentally enters the disintegration chamber with an undetected fly. The two become fused into one being. Andre ends up with a fly head and claw. The fly gets Andre's head and upper body. Andre's wife is tested to the depths of her love for her now hideous husband. A frantic search for the tiny fly ensues (maybe they could de-fuse them??) with tragic results. Vincent Price is excellent as Andre's brother. Yes, it's true that &quot;Return Of The Fly&quot; is nowhere near as good as it's predocessor. However, I like having them both together anyway. Andre's son Phillipe is all grown up and decides to continue his father's work. He enlists the help of a guy who turns out to be a sociopathic criminal, bent on stealing the invention and selling it to an accomplice. After killing a nosey cop (by turning him into a guinea pig man), he knocks Phillipe out and puts him in the disintegration cabinet with a suspiciously handy fly. The rest of the film is a revenge story. I like the crooks and the way Phillipe avenges their treachery. A great double feature! Pop some corn, pour the beverages, and check the house for those pesky insects..+dvd
A 'minor' note+N+Content of the movie aside, has no one noticed the cover of the DVD???  The American flag is backwards!!!  The field of blue is always on the LEFT if the flag is hanging vertical.  I'm glad that Disney didn't get to build its American history theme park in northern Virginia back in the 80's.  If they can't get a simple DVD cover right, just imagine what could have happened+dvd
Mr. L Mapes+N+I was very disappointed in this product, as the recordings were the worst I've ever seen. I could have done a better job of recording these for re-sale. With all the Computor knowledge that we have today, it's a shame that a product of this quality would be sold. Amazon, you messed up good this time.+dvd
Read Between the Lines+N+If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.  By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease+dvd
Better than Vanilla Sky+P+This movie was much better than "Vanilla Sky."  "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  "Open Your Eyes" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get "Open Your Eyes.+dvd
Anger management fails...+N+I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching. +dvd
Good but not Great+P+A very sensitive and touching movie about a boy and his teacher. It has some gratutious scenes and the story does not flow very smoothly, but none the less worth watching and the ending reveals alot about humanity throughout the ages.+dvd
Innauguration of the Pleasure Dome a Pleasure Indeed+P+If you've seen the old Mystic Fire VHS of these films, you will be amazed at the quality of this DVD.  Innauguration is breathtakingly vivid.  I haven't even been able to watch all of the films yet, only Eaux d'Artifice and Innauguration, but I was so enthused by what I had seen that I couldn't wait to get on here and praise it.  Ken is a visionary film maker in the most literal sense of the word.  These films also come from an interesting milieu of individuals and circumstances and are important historical documents as well as lovely works of art.  As a Thelemite, I  have long admired Anger's art and his dedication to promulgating Aleister Crowley's teachings.  Yet his art, although rooted in a Thelemic idiom, is not trapped by it, and it should appeal to anyone interested in the visual language of transcendence.  I'm already slavering for volume II+dvd
the wedding dress+N+I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what+dvd
Good but not as good as 1st 2 movies+P+I like this movie the least of the Mad Max trilogy. Anyways, several years after the events of "The Road Warrior", "Mad" Max is still wandering the wastlands of the post-apocalyptic Australia. He shows up at a "semi-civilization" called, Bartertown. Where through events that would take to long to describe, he ends up being forced to fight in a arena called, Thunderdome. Where he soon escapes (creating alot of havoc for Bartertown) and escapes in to the desert. Where he is found by a bunch of Goonie-like kids,and they sorta annoy me.I wonder why they put them into it when Mad Max was based on car crashes rather than playschool.I know i will get people trying to tell me that scene was good,cause the kids acted well,but i thought it was crap.Also it lacked his brilliant car,i know it got smashed up,but they coulda made it so he found another cool car. The script lacked punch i think.Some of the acting was average. I remember being excited when they said this movie was being released,only to be disappointed because it simply does not match it with mad max 2. But after seeing it quite a few times,i do enjoy it,but i just cant feel satisfied with it comparing it to the first 2 installments to this trio. But its still quite a good movie+dvd
Finally on DVD - and worth the wait!+P+I've always had a soft spot for this cheese-fest from the 60's, and since I am a MAJOR Inger Stevens fan, this is a must-have.  The good news here is that the print is excellent, and has both the wide-screen version, which is the best version - LOTS of picture image is cropped out of the pan'n'scan version, as well as the "full-frame" pan'n'scan chopped up version for those that insist on these inferior video image displays.  Tons of cool cameos, fantastic title song by The Turtles make this a winner. No extras other than the trailer, but I say if you liked this movie in the past or just like those wacky 60's sex-comedies this is an essential purchase.+dvd
Not enough stars+P+I'm sure some folks will not agree with with me and thats ok. I think there are not enough stars to rate this. Three big reasons: 1) The Beatles 2) The other acts 3) Commercials Trip down memory lane for me back to grade school. And I kept hearing my Dad [...] about the "long hair", when 4 years later he would have bought me a car if I wore my hair that short. What a gem. At least for me+dvd
Interesting Spy thriller+P+Interesting and different role for George Segal.  The movie takes you into the "confusing world of espionage".  Very watchable older movie and done without all the modern day pyrotechnics. Some other familiar actors/actresses are also present+dvd
Perfect in every way.+P+This DVD is truly inspiring, the things she can do while so heavely preagnant is amazing. Its got the whole body covered. And you keep thinking if she can do you so can you. One of the best DVD's for pregnant women out there. One can even do it if you're not pregnaunt. The three training levels, Beginnger, Intermediate and Advance makes this DVD perfect for first timers, and it is challenging enough for those whose been exercising.  I Love it and recommend anyone and every one to add it to your collection+dvd
Hugely Entertaining and Rewarding Mystery+P+OK, I'm not a film critic. I do like older movies, especially Hitchcock mysteries and John Wayne Westerns and that makes me decidedly middle-brow. All I can say is that 'Dial M for Murder' is a hugely entertaining mystery that rewards the viewer who pays attention (umm, it is a mystery after all). Several delicious plot twists+dvd
Only in 2 channel stereo and to much talking & interviews+N+Wow, she has to travel and stay in hotels. Never would have guessed that.+dvd
Below Average+N+&quot;My Reflections&quot; dvd is much better as it is a concert. This dvd is a bunch of videos and interviews. Not a keeper. Rent in first.+dvd
Bloody Sunday +P+The best movie I have seen in a long time Have watched it a few times and never get tried of it  It brought home what the people of Ireland had to go through and the heartache +dvd
Loved it!  Rose Red combines many likes!+P+I loved the movie in the way it is not too grose for children to watch, but is has suspence, mistery, ghosts and other paranormal all mixed into one.  Easy to follow and loved the amount of background informatio+dvd
More Show!!!!+P+I really enjoyed this dvd because it had more of the show filmed than in the vhs riverdance - the show. It is a little bit of an annoyance that I have to flip it over in the middle. I definately like Colin Dunne's dancing better than Michael Flateley's, Colin doesn't seem to steal the spotlight away from Jean Butler as much as Michael did. It gets my thumbs up+dvd
Enthralling, painful, profound, cathartic+P+Thoreau said "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." While this may be true of some, others are not so quiet. Caouette has unleashed a tidal wave of agony and angst, at times a shill scream of adolescent suffering, at other times a low moan of early adult-onset life affliction. Truly, many of us know the feeling of wanting to explode and fill the void with the screech of our own inner turmoils, but lack the voice, the means, the mechanisms. For want of a method we seeth silently, voiceless, castrated, invisible. We want to be known and loved and understood and instead we stammer and stutter and fall silent. We pack in our caring and seal our emotions and vulnerabilities behind high walls of rationality and apathy. Or we scribble in diaries or blogs and our hidden solitary torture goes wholly unnoticed.   Caouette has commendably captured in video and audio snippets, in stills and captions, a glimpse into the troubled past that haunts and harasses him. He has undertake a photo collage of his own life experience, himself as the subject matter and the material. I cannot know how much he left on the cutting room floor, what he felt necessary or desireable to expunge, but he seems to have faced it all with remarkable candor and vulnerability. He survived a rural Southern upbringing, a father-less household, poverty, a love of film, and homosexuality. To that potent melange, he added mental illness, abandonment, foster care, PCP, physical and sexual abuse.   I cannot say that I understand his life even after viewing it or that I can even relate to some of the events that shaped him. But through his art I feel that I can say I know a little of him and I can say that I empathize with his pain. I will never walk a mile in his shoes, but I don't think I have to in order to care about the tribulations and fate of another human being. It is his candor and vulnerability, his willingness to expose the deepest parts of his own psyche and say "Here I am, look at me." that makes me care about him. That gives me a reason to watch and wonder, How did he turn out? Seeing the first half of the project, one would be forgiven for thinking "This will end badly." That one of these stark text captions will announce his successful suicide and provide that closing parenthesis to his life: Jonathan Caouette (1975 - 200x).  Ultimately, I think he redeemed himself and perhaps transcended his lot in life.   What I saw as the film continued was a man coming to terms with himself and his past. A man demonstrating that he is capable of finding love and connecting with others. A man who did not harbor resentments for the wrongs done to him and his mother, did not harbor a grudge toward his father or grandparents for abandonment or abuse. Rather, I saw a thoughtful, emotional, caring man, a creative artist, a loving partner and a devoted son. His journey is not yet complete, but as the film concluded, I felt a compassion and a sense of optimism, for not just Jonathan, but for all of us.    +dvd
great for toddlers !!!+P+My daughter loves this DVD!  At age 2 she can already say her ABCs, recognize all the letters individually, and even write some small words.  This is a wonderful, educational DVD+dvd
hip hop documentary??!??+N+Straight from the streets wasn`t what I expected. If you ask me this isn`t even a documentary about hip hop, more a documentary on black people. On this DVD you have a lot of black people talkin how they shouldn`t fight amongst each other, how they should unite and stuff like that. Besides the interviews with ice t and the low rider show this dvd has nothing to offer. It is NOT A HIP HOP DOCUMENTARY, if you want a hip hop documentary on DVD, buy Rhyme &amp; Reason+dvd
The BARD: Who Was He???+P+"What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form and moving, how express and admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!"  The man this program is in search for is the one who wrote the above beautiful words and, as well, wrote many verses and words like it.  His name: William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616), "[a man] not of an age, but for all time."  Surprisingly, not much is known of Shakespeare's life, until now.  The enthusiastic Michael Wood takes us on a wonderful trek to discover just who Shakespeare was.  We learn about such things as follows:  his parentage; his birth; his times, the politics and religion of the time; his youth; his marriage and loves; his "lost" years; his London years; his career; and his plays and sonnets.  There are four parts to this program (originally aired on the Public Broadcasting Station).  Each includes a very brief introduction that I will reproduce here:  (1) A Time of Reformation (9 scenes including introduction and credits)  "Like all stories in history, this is a search for ghosts.  A quest for the people that made us what we are.  And for one man in particular.  William Shakespeare is the most famous writer of all times...Yet his life is still shrouded in mystery...This is a historical detective story...searching for the life of William Shakespeare of Stratford Upon the Avon."  This is the only part where Wood gives a summary.  He says,    "There's the first nineteen years of Shakespeare's life.  [Wood then proceeds with his brief summary...]  and that's just the beginning of the story!"    (2) The Lost Years (8 scenes)  "How did a poor country boy...become such a celebrity so soon after he arrived in London?  It's one of the great mysteries of Shakespeare's life...Ten years before Shakespeare had been...in Stratford with no job and few prospects.  How did he do it?  How did he make that leap?  And what did he do in those ten years?"  (3) The Duty of Poets (8 scenes)  "In the 1590s the English theatre entered its golden age and for the next twenty years its brightest star was William Shakespeare.  But back in the early 1590s, Shakespeare was one of many gifted young poets.  What was it that transformed him in the next few years to the greatest thing anybody had ever seen.  What happened to him in his career and his private life?"  (4) For All Time (8 scenes)  "For William Shakespeare, 1603 was a very good year.  Writer, actor, director, he was now the artist and chief of Elizabethan theatre.  He created some of the greatest characters in literature...In [England], theatre wasn't just entertainment, it was popular and political - it had a thrilling and dangerous power.  Shakespeare...is...in his late thirties...Out of the experience of his life and the turbulent times through which he lived, the new worlds and the lost worlds, he pulls it all together in some of the greatest works of literature ever written.  It's that last story and the mysterious end to his career that we're going to uncover."  Wood travels extensively to different places, talking and interviewing people.  He even reads from the actual historical documents that indicate something about Shakespeare, some of it uncovered only recently!  The cinematography is breathtaking.  The photography inside actual buildings of Shakespeare's time is fantastic.  The background music compliments Wood's narrative.  Special mention should be given to the Royal Shakespearean Company who travel with Wood.  They act out bits of not only Shakespeare's plays but other plays of that time (such as those of his rival, Christopher Marlowe).  You'll hear bits of his plays from each of these categories:   the Romantic Comedies (example: "A Midsummers Night Dream"); the Histories (example: "Henry IV," Part 1); Tragedies (example: "Macbeth"); and the Tragicomic Romances (example: "The Tempest").  (There was no example from his "Problem" plays.)  There is one DVD extra (about twenty minutes) that has eight scenes. It is quite good.  The DVD's picture and sound quality were perfect.  There were no distracting artifacts.  Finally, if you're a William Shakespeare fanatic like I am, then you'll enjoy this program.  I learned a lot of new things that I was not aware of before.  If you're a newcomer to Shakespeare's life then I envy you.  This program is the best introduction to his life, in my opinion, that there is.  In conclusion, be sure to view this program and find out why Shakespeare discovered that the duty of poets was "to speak what we feel and not what we ought to say!"  (2003;  4 hours;  2 discs;  made for TV; wide screen) +dvd
Overhyped cult film finally makes good.+P+I'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.  Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.  (Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold. C'mon Lucas, you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.+dvd
good movie for the little budget they had!+P+i saw this movie first as well as reincarnation and i gotta say, stop hate'n on it cause of the budget! this is the best low budget flick ive seen so far with good f/x for the money they had to spend. it has a good plot if you listen and watch carefully so dont hate on the movie because of the production+dvd
Why?+N+This is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie.  Josie, at 25, is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school, and whines for the entire movie.  It's unclear why any one likes her, espesially her teacher.  It's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher, beleiving that she is in high school, makes no attempt to hide his feelings.  The final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with.  Never Been Kissed isn't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy; it's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content+dvd
Not Worth Your Time+N+The only good thing about this movie is the plot.  From there it goes downhill.  The script needs to be rewritten to add some sophistication to it.  The acting is marginal except for the actor that plays Justin.  If the script were rewritten then I think the acting would be better, maybe+dvd
Wow.+P+How to get busted in a totalitarian regime: make a film like Firemen's Ball. Just watched that last night. Amazed. Brilliant transfer. May not be as poignant as Loves of a Blonde or his later works, but a rousing critique of the regime with some really funny scenes. But, again, that transfer amazed me. Hard to believe it's a 35 year old czech film. Highly recommended. Enjoyed Forman's comments on the film and the debacle that ensued. He was almost locked up for 10 years and was luckily helped out by none other than Francois Truffaut! Beautiful+dvd
Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead.+N+I waited ages to get this Fulci classic and now I wished I did not. It is probably Fulci's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film #33 from him. I can buy GIALLO being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched, but this one is just plain bad from start to finish, it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence (chain whipping also appeared in "The Beyond"; Fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff), "Don't Torture a Duckling" is completely void of substance, mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making, from the obvious papermashy heads to the "shall I stand here and act now" type blemish on everyone's face, considering this is Fulci's 33rd film or thereabouts, it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror, I was expecting a somewhat smart GIALLO and got drawn out rubbish instead. Like I said - Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead. It was made by Argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead. I would recommend that Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's cash crop schlock "Don't Torture a Duckling" any day of the week+dvd
"Our daddy's gonna kill you, preacher!"+P+I think that line (spoken by a crowd of evil children before they beat up an unarmed, chained Russell Crowe) sums up the movie well. This movie does an excellent job of communicating the sheer GLEE of sadism. Everyone in this movie (with the partial exceptions of Stone and Crowe) don't just like to inflict pain on others - they ENJOY it. They cackle and quip and snicker and guffaw as they blast enormous, ragged, bleeding holes into people. This is an excellent (if somewhat garish and comic-bookish) look at an evil that has infected a whole town. Imagine Eastwood's more sinister and sometimes turgid attempts (High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven come to mind), but with a wink and a sense of humor. More slow-mo than the Olympics. Pioneered the bullet cam that has since been done to death. Ms Stone shows a lot of leg. So, it's got a lot going for it is what I'm saying.  +dvd
Five stars are not enough+P+Having read through most of the other reviews of this excellent series, I find there is little new praise to add.  We stumbled upon this series when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre one evening and have been hooked ever since.   Kitchen conveys volumes about his character's inner turmoil and thoughts--without speaking a single word.  By watching the delightful interplay between Foyle and Sam, between father and son, between employer and subordinate, friend and friend, you discover nuggets of each person's upbringings, beliefs, losses, and fears. The mostly-unseen character who influences them all, the soon-to-invade German army, continuously forces each character to internally re-examine his or her priorities and decisions.  This series is superb. Anyone interested in mysteries or in history will thoroughly enjoy.+dvd
Lola's Running +P+I thought this product was awsome, a classic, cheaply priced, and I recieved item way before the delivery date. Recommend buying movies from this seller.  This movie was creative (although it was in subtitles), and equally unique from any of the other movies I found over the internet.        +dvd
Save your money+N+I bought this DVD based on the excellent reviews.  As both an afficionado, and practitioner of kink, I am always looking for a good film in that genre.  Not only is "Maitresse" poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable.    I also found the film "quality" leaving a lot to be desired. (Poor lighting) I found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it.    The relationship and communication between the Domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling, and left me with the impression that I had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other.  There was just no chemistry between the players.  Save your money+dvd
A Disappointment...Ugh...Not recommended.+N+For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix.   The ex-con cannot deal with "her career" eventually and threatens her to quit, etc. (At some point, you get the idea that the director himself really doesn't understand where the Domina is coming from.)  What started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through. The writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection (or pimp, for want of a better word). Then, we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse, where a real horse is shown killed onscreen, strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly (this image will upset you for weeks, believe me! [I feel like it's my duty to WARN YOU!]). And the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots. Totally stupid (like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas).  Believe me, I really WANTED to like this movie. I ignored the negative reviews, because there are so few "real" films on this subject. But I was sorely disappointed and depressed by it.  If you need to see this film, rent it. It's definitely a "one view" film at best; and it will be a film that will leave you angry (because the horse scene) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out. Too bad.  "Moonlight Whispers" is a much better, respectful treatment of S/M, a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological (and sexual orientation) questions, while also being a beautiful film to watch. That film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience!    +dvd
redford/gandolfini cannot save terrible script+N+Redford is a 3 star general sentenced to 10 years, for what we later learn is sending men to die in a mission contradicting a presidential order.  Gandolfini is the brutal military prison warden, who orders the death of a soldier/prisoner, inciting Redford to lead the men in revolt.  The problem is both men are cut from the same cloth, as the script poorly distinguishes them.  This complexity is useful, but not when neither character is worth rooting for.  The most telling scene is when a reluctant follower asks the ex-General if leading men is just moving pieces on a chessboard to him.  Redford answers it is, and we infer this is 'the burden of command,' his book on warfare, i.e. the ends justify the means in battle.  It is hard to become a pawn for the great military machine, when the cause is unjust or not worth the price.  Here, the men can just follow the severe code versus revolt.  While Gandolfini's warden goes too far, his justification of needing order is reasonable.    He tries to get Redford shipped out on mental issues, delusions of taking command.  The problem is, Redford really does what the Warden says shows mental infirmity.  As if he cant adjust to not commanding thousands, he invents a battle.  The battle seems as much about the General's need to command troops and teach the Warden a lesson as anything else.  No real reason was given as to why his personal connections could not have fixed the prison problems, and they were already going that way as Redford met with the Warden's superior, who 'put him on notice.'  In addition to poor character development, taking one step back the whole basis and execution of conflict in a prison yard is laughable.  Last, the ending is so insipid, everyone who sees it will think of 5 ways it could have ended more intelligently.  The film instead tries to make a tearjerker when no such ending was needed or justified.  A great film of the evil nature of man's institutions is One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.  A great war film for moral ambiguity is Platoon.  Last Castle is a must miss+dvd
THE SCENE FROM JOHN, RAISING LAZARUS...+P+This is a traditional telling of the life of Jesus, from before his birth to the resurrection. The cinematography is breathtaking, the color, the costuming, the writing aided by Carl Sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of Jesus weeping and then raising Lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring. It was this scene which motivated me to write this review. Rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb, Stevens has Jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff, puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill. Once there, Jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of Ivan Mestrovic and the French bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century. When Jesus reaches the high tomb, Stevens and Sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the God of life before Jesus calls out, "LAZARUS! COME FORTH!"  But in striking juxtaposition, Stevens pulls back the camera, hundreds of feet from the tomb showing Jesus, the Son of the Almighty, as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside, let alone the universe, much as the fist fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck in BIG COUNTRY, shows the scale of man to God's work. However, as Jesus calls-out Lazarus instead of seeing him rise, we see the wonderment, the bewilderment, the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss. We see in the crowd, as the camera dollies, rolls and scans, the faces of the believers, the unbelievers, the doubters and the ever faithful, their reactions to a man dead three days, reawakened by an act of God, brought forth by a human being, favored by God. How much more effective was this direction? Rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise, we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing, the awe, the tears of joy, the fear, the love, the attempts to reconcile with reality, the unbelievable. There was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring  artist or film director. My only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one, Jesus' (Max Von Sydow) hair is too short. If you believe, clap your hands, and even if you don't, its worth the 199 minutes of your time. I saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the VHS and DVD, and watched it with a group, one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the Lazarus scene. 4.75 Star+dvd
Highly disappointing, definitely not for everyone+N+the trouble with this DVD is that it is too fast, too brief and with no real outline of pilates for 'everyone' as the title implies. This is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new. However I found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me. I like to do my pilates slowly, and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly.  There is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises. There was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives, but it is all done during the exercises, so it is of little use. It is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core, and anchor yourself to the floor. It is definitely a quick once over.  I enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this, but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates. There are some very good books which can get your started, I loved Brooke Siler's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives.+dvd
'Bowled over, big time!+P+Another NFL season gone, another round of NFL playoffs comin' up (as of this writing). This is the time I usually look back on those great Super Bowl teams of yore by whippin' out those half-hour Super Bowl highlight shows I taped offa ESPN2 several years back. That is, until NFL Films finally saw the light and put the first thirty together in separate DVD box sets, now combined into this super-set. Now I can watch my fave Super Bowl shows (AKA the 49er and Redskins victories, and the ones the Cowboys, Rams, & Raiders lost) don't have to worry about my gradually deteriorating VHS tapes getting eaten by my VCR!  While I thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks I threw down, NFL Films added even more value to the presentation by throwing two featurettes in with each Super Bowl game. Included among the mini-shows in games I to X are brief profiles of the careers of Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Bob Lilly, Jack Lambert, and Roger Staubach. Also showcased: the silent enigma that was Cowboys RB Duane Thomas, the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season and their famed(?) "No-Name" defense of the early 70s, the legacy of Tom Landry, the fights that broke out between CBS and NBC before, during, and after their simultaneous broadcast of Game I, the Minnesota Vikings setting the standard for Super Bowl futility, and other sideline stuff I never knew about before.  Then there's the second decalogue of  highlights from "The Great American Time-Out", featuring both good moments (the 49ers' first two wins in XVI & XIX; The `Skins' first Super Bowl Championship in game XVII, and the Bears' 46 defense stealing the show in game XX) and not-so-great ones (The Raiders claiming games XI, XV, and XVIII, and the Cowboys picking up their second Lombardi trophy after XII). While I found most of the featurettes in the XI to XX run kinda interesting, I was also driven to nausea by the sappiness of a few of `em. Runnin' the Saccharine-o-meter to the red zone was the piece on Anthony Munoz and his NFL prospect son, Howie Long discussing his life in football and how he's been keepin' himself busy after his retirement, and Jim Plunkett pulling himself off of the NFL scrap heap to lead the Raiders to two Super Bowl championships. I swear, if I hear one more interview where someone was talking about how much heart ol' what's-his-face had, or how so-and-so's toughness & drive really inspired the rest of the team, I'm gonna need insulin treatments!  Finally, there's the third decalogue of shows, featuring the good (the 49ers' last three championships & the `Skins' last two), the bad (the Giants escaping game XXV with the win, and the Cowboys grabbin' three Lombardis in four seasons in games XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX), and the downright ugly (The Broncos and Bills match the Vikings' record for Super Bowl haplessness). Sadly, most of the contests recapped here were more like "Stupor Bowls" (see my ListMania on this coma-inducing phenomenon at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/POLOADG90JFT/ref=cm_aya_av.lm_more/102-8646183-3962510 ), featuring the bulk of the NFC's 13 year dominance of the big dance,  including the only two Super Bowls where the winning team scored 50 points or more (XXIV and XXVII). A couple games were close at halftime (XXI & XXVIII), but the NFC champions eventually managed to pull well away from their less-than-capable AFC opponents in the second half. Fortunately, there was a halfway decent Super Bowl (XXX) along with two of the greatest ever played (XXIII featuring Joe Montana's legendary drive, and Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood's "miss heard `round the world" in XXV) to help keep the boredom from setting in too deeply. Adding a touch of excitement to both the "blah" games and the smattering of close ones is the wonderful background music, which is some of the most exciting soundtrack tunage I've ever laid my ears on. BTW I'm glad to see NFL Films has seen the light and finally put a whole buncha these tracks out on CD (check it out at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002VERQA/ref=cm_aya_wlasin.title/102-8646183-3962510?v=glance&coliid=I49VMCS3COBJX&colid=35SRBZ4ZQ8HU3 )...  Unfortunately, there were a couple things that I noticed were amiss: the Supe XXI and XXIII shows have been edited down a bit. I recall the XXI show being titled "Land of the Giants" during the "opening credits" sequence when I caught it on ESPN2, but when I saw it on DVD here, the "Land of the Giants" title had been deleted. More heavily edited was the opening title ("Drive to Greatness") & credits sequence to the Game XXIII show, which was completely excised.   The featurettes in this set usually cover the players who coached or participated in each game (Doug Williams as the Super Bowl's first black quarterback in XXII, Steve Young in XXIX, etc.) or breaks down the most memorable moment in that game (like the Niners' game-winning drive in XXIII, Norwood's miss in XXV, Leon Lett-ing a TD get away in XXVII, etc.). Like the previous sideshows, the XXI-to-XXX mini-films were a bit sappy...   Now I'm wondering if NFL Films will wait until after game XL is played before they put out the final  box set-- well, "final" `til games XLI to L have been played, anyway-- or will they do it shortly after XXXIX, and leave the set one Super Bowl short of a full ten? Personally, I'm hoping they go for the former option; I'm patient enough that I could stand to wait an extra year to get a complete ten-game set. But even if they don't wait, set four will likely be the most exciting of the bunch, featuring the best bits of XXXII (John Elway & the Broncos finally winning it all), XXXIV (the Titans end up a yard short of tying the game as time runs out), and XXVI & XXVIII (the Pats' Adam Vinatieri becomes the first kicker to win two Super Bowls with field goals in the closing moments). In any case, I can hardly freakin' wait...  `Lat+dvd

"Tom Baxter's come down off the screen and he's running around New Jersey!... Nobody knows how it happened, but he's done it." +P+"The Purple Rose of Cairo" was the first Allen's movie I saw back in Moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films. "The Purple Rose..." is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches "Purple Rose of Cairo" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and "trapped" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all, Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave "Purple Rose of Cairo", too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as "Purple Rose of Cairo".  9.5/10+dvd
Yet another complaint+N+I'll add my complaint to the others who find that bundling Cold Comfort Farm with another movie I don't want is stupid+dvd
A great movie but is it the same as the theatrical release?+P+I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.    The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.  At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.    I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.   On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.  So where is the version with the alternative ending???+dvd
BEST DVD/TV Workout!!!+P+I was revisiting this page because my sister-in-law just told me there is a new dvd out! so...trying to find out more!   I LOVE this workout and tell everyone about it honestly! I don't have extensive ballet skills at all...unless you call 2nd grade having any ballet skills! AND this does not seem that strenuous to me AT ALL - i almost thought it was a waste of time as me and my husband did this for the first time in 2000/2001 (seemed too easy), but...after the second time of doing this and you start to feel your muscles coming to life again and you start to hold things (like my kids!) with your upper body the way you are suppose to! It's amazing...the abs section for any mom trying to get back in shape is AMAZING! and right along the line of what my doctor recommended, but you somehow feel more elegant doing it to classic music with the soft voice directing you! I don't normally love dvd/tv exercising would much rather go out for a walk, etc...but this is so good to tone your muscles and help you feel strong! or as the front of the dvd states "Stretches and Exercises ANYONE Can Do for a Strong, Graceful and Sculpted Body"   I TOTALLY Agree and seeing as my husband did this with me the first time (and there is also a sports option to help strengthen him for skiing!) I don't understand where people are saying they had a hard time following it... Maybe they couldn't keep up, but...any aerobics class, yoga class or pilates class i've ever been to - the instructor usually say the same thing just do as much as you can and just as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit and once you do it a couple of time you will get the hang of it! that's what practice is for - no one is perfect typically the first time+dvd
arthur lee forever!+P+the time he was given was such a little while, but his music was way more than style. i would rate this dvd one notch above 5 stars. let's call it goosebumps. buy it for the experience. the referral is free+dvd
Best Season+P+This is Miami Vice's best season - at least to me. The stars, music and Testerosa all come to together for insiteful and consistent episodes each week. And I appreciate the improved packaging so I don't have to flip DVD's to watch more. Any Vice fan needs Season 3.+dvd
DVD Bonus Features alone is worth getting this disc+P+Like finding the Titanic in the backwoods of Kentucky, in AWE!!! Awesome extra DVD features, touching Interviews and insight on Waverly HIlls. It kind of freaked me out all that vile stuff thrown in the woods. If you love creepy things, this it it. Well Produce+dvd
Torn+N+This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story.  But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie.  Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie....  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend...  much like the more recent movie about King Arthur.  Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers......  So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating...+dvd
On My List of Perfect Movies+P+Everything about this movie is perfect, acting, directing, singing, cinematography. I watch it about every six months. Wouldn't change a thing+dvd

Addicted to This Movie+P+I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, and I enjoy watching and discussing his deep, dark movies like &quot;The Beguiled&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven.&quot;  But my guilty secret is: whenever &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; show up on cable TV, I get a big goofy grin on my face, drop everything I'm doing, and watch it.  I realize this film is an acquired taste, but I *love* it.  It's my redneck roots coming out.  The overage bikers, Clyde the orangutang, William Smith, crazy old Ruth Gordon, Geoffrey Lewis, Clint crooning with Ray Charles on the soundtrack, even Sondra Locke's singing and acting (which comes off as enjoyably campy in this context)--it's all great!  And I love the message of &quot;we rustic rural types are just as interesting as anybody else&quot; (because these *are* my people, as I've said.)  I don't think Eastwood has made a more enjoyable movie+dvd
THIS MOVIE IS BEAUTIFULLY AWFUL.+P+I love this movie.  The acting is hilariously bad, the music is great, it's campy, not realistic at all and I wouldn't want it any other way.  I've probably seen it 30 times.  Every time I see something that makes me laugh.  Nine times out of ten the laughing has nothing to do with the scene being shot to be funny.  It's totally dated and in the dying metal days of the early nineties.  I'd recommend it to musicians totally.  Just remember that it's totally terrible in a Rocky Horror kind of way+dvd
Jane as she should be portrayed+P+This is, in my opinion, the best Jane Eyre of them all.  The characters look the part, and the film is beautifully shot and convincingly acted. A great romantic movie+dvd
The theme song was NOT changed+P+This is in response to the concerns a couple people have raised about the theme song. In the original broadcast run the theme song was sung by studio singers for the first 10 or so episodes only. After that new vocals were recorded by Johnny Mathis and Denise Williams over the same backing tracks and their vocals were heard on all subsequent episodes. That is exactly what happens on these DVDs. After episode 10 we get the Mathis/Williams recording on all the remaining episodes. I have all these early episodes on VHS recorded MANY years ago and the theme song - with both pairs of singers - is exactly the same+dvd
great ab workout+P+great ab workout with simple instruction; leisa hart was my life saver with her fitmama videos, and now i am feeling so much better than i did after my first two babies,, my abs are getting toned(the extra skin is still there, but that will take me time), but i can see definition that i did not have before. the sexiness of this video, and all the Sexy Series videos, is very real, nothing fake or cheesy, it is very professionally produced and it is getting me the results i want, i highly recommend this workout+dvd
Lord of the, oh I mean Feet of Flames.+N+This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego+dvd
Creaky+N+Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going+dvd
2.5 stars+N+Alright. So I had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it. A week or so ago it was playing on Oprah's Oxygen network and I was very happy that I would finally be able to see it. Overall, it was alright. So then it was on again the next day and I couldn't stomach watching it again.  It may be called Brown Sugar, but the plot moves slower than molasses. It is way too predictable and sweet, with very little substance. It wasn't even all too interseting the first time around and I couldn't stand seeing it a second time. There's a reason why these movies are on TV, people. No need to purchase the DVD. As soon as I saw it once, I had gotten my dose and wanted no more+dvd
ALL I EXPECTED+P+I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS DVD FOR SOME TIME--  I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT.  THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE VIDEO IS VERY SHARP. I WOULD RECCOMEND IT +dvd
One Bad, One Average Episode!+N+As the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end, I'm left unsurprised that Classic Trek got axed at this season's end.  After a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes (where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons?) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel.  The first episode is just very, very poor with terrible scriptwriting and Spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms.  The overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid.  Why wouldn't a force strong enough to send the Enterprise 1000 light years away just simply destroy the Enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained.  Why would the computer have to make replicas of Lee Meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot.  I can safely say that this episode "That Which Survives" is one of the worst 3 episodes in the entire classic trekdom.  The second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves.  The script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be.  This episode ranks among the better ones of season 3 as well.  Overall, we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the "give it a miss" category if you are deciding which volumes to collect.+dvd
Northanger Abbey video review+N+This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen.  The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works.  Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice.  The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in "All Creatures Great and Small") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff.  I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice.  The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book.  As they say, "the book was better," and in this case, the old saying couldn't be more true+dvd
Not Uncut = ****!+N+Gah. Judging from earlier descriptions of this box, I thought it'd be Uncut and billingual like other 4Kids DVDs. It's not the case, so no dice+dvd
This sucks on ice!!!!!!!+N+This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all!+dvd
The best out there...+P+There's really not much to say. It is simply the best karate movie ever made so far and by far. Captures the true spirit of what karate movies fans want to see. A must see for every martial arts fanatic+dvd
Loved the movie. The DVD, not so much+P+The 13th century, Europe. Russia (at this time known as "Rus") is at her weakest, with Mongolian hordes overrunning her lands to the east. What remains of Russia seems ready to fall as the Germanic order of the Teutonic Knights - under the blessings of the Catholic Church - march on to take the land for Rome. Thus this is the setting for "Alexander Nevksy," probably one of the earliest "great hero versus the evil horde" type of movies ever made.   It is very clear who you're supposed to love and who you're supposed to hate in this movie. The Russian characters are a grand assortment of loveable characters that are well developed in their own right. On one hand you have Vasily and Gavrilo, two friends vying for the affection of a young girl who enter a pact that whoever proves bravest in battle will win her hand. You also have have Ignat, the friendly armorer who seems to find a bird metaphor for every situation. (and was personally my favorite character) On the other hand, the Teutonic Knights are portrayed as absolute devils. They are a deeply militarized enemy, wearing masks that turn them into a lifeless, faceless enemy. The Grand Master plans to divide Rus among his knights, orders the death of Russian POW's, and in one scene tosses babies into a bonfire. (although in Eisenstein's defense, this wasn't his creation - that was what the Teutonic Knights supposedly did) Likewise, the Russian who betrays the city of Pskov to the Germans is hated by Alexander even more than the Grand Master is.   A lot has been discussed about the propaganda nature of the film. Obviously at the time there was tension between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and this surely inspired Eisenstein in his work. The villifying of the Germans as well as the subtle symbolism - the swastika-like shape on the Bishop's hat and the hands hand sticking out of Teutonic helmets as if in a Sieg Heil - can only support this. The film's soundtrack is peppered with patriotic Russian songs calling for the people to rise up against the enemy, defend Russian land, and the usual calls to arms.  I do not feel, however, that this detracts at all from the film. Eisenstein was always an artist first and a politician last. The character of Alexander Nevksy is portrayed as dashing, compassionate, brave, and a man-of-the-people because that was how Russian legend portrayed him, and that was how he was emoted through the actor Nikolai Cherkassov. A lot of people have said he is a metaphor for Stalin, but at no point in the film did I think, "Wow, this Nevsky is a lot like Stalin." Nevsky is no more like Stalin than were King David of the Bible, Aragorn in "Lord of the Rings," or Davy Crockett of the Alamo's legend. Some of the more negative reviewers have wondered how Stalin signed the pact with Germany after this film was released - the truth is, the film wasn't released for too long. The Soviet government approved it's making, then removed it from theaters after the non-aggression pact was signed with Germany. Eisenstein was heartbroken because, as stated before, he was always an artist before a politician. It should be noted especially that for a time before this film as made he could not get support in Russia because the communists disapproved of his putting film method over party ideals.  And Eisenstein's touch for filmmaking certainly shines through here, as the man who brought us the famous Odessa steps sequence in "The Battleship Potemkin" brings us the the Battle on the Ice sequence. The close shots of  hand-to-hand combat are stunning for the time they were filmed. (even if by today's standards it looks like a bunch of guys clanking their shields together) From Nevsky's cavalry charge to the Teutonic shield wall to the crumbling of the ice, you'll find yourself rooting for the Russians at least once or twice. (I especially laughed at the part where Gavrilo grabs a German, spits in his face, and axes him out)  Regrettably, the DVD is not too good. There's not even a title menu - when you put the DVD in it goes straight to the movie, and when it's done it goes to the chapter selection. There's no commentary, no original trailer, no cast bios - nothing! This combined with an unrestored audio track and sloppily placed subtitles almost hurts the movie-watching experience. Considering this film is put alongside "Battleship Potemkin" and "Ivan the Terrible" as Eisenstein's greatest films, I think it deserves something better. Maybe in the future Criterion will do what they did for Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and finally give the film a decent DVD release. Wait...technically they did, but it's in an $80 DVD compilation with "Ivan the Terrible." I suppose if you're willing to bring out the extra bucks, you can be happy at last.  All in all, I was not disappointed with this film. If you liked "The Battleship Potemkin," like Russian cinema, or you want to see a good foreign film, (or you want to see what the Russians had before "LOTR: The Two Towers" was made) this I definitely recommend this movie+dvd
Good movie+P+It's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it doesn't make sense. I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show. Robert Stack plays the role of Captain Larkin, Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Detective Daniel Myerson, and the beautiful young women was Farrah Fawcett majors who played the role of Karen White. This was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502. After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases. All and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star. As far as Farrah Fawcett Majors goes, she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge.   +dvd
DISAPPOINTMENT OF A LIFE-TIME...............+N+and i guess along, i knew it would be!!! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows. period.!!! THERE IS NO.. nor...EVER CAN BE a "revival" of the original...sorry! "revival" was a VERY forgettable attempt by dan curtis (genius) to desparately cling on to an old idea...and i don't blame him, cause it' is my favorite show of all time, but by the 90's, the people and the mood was altogether different fom the 60's...cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber, destined to fail because of that alone...was time to seal the old coffin up 1n 1971...and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was. +dvd
Classic western with Henry Fonda+P+Wonderful movie. Wanted to buy classic westerns for the nursing home I work at and know they will love it. I watched it and it is great. Thank you+dvd
I think+P+it was a hoot upon seeing this film in the theatre espeically the part where Candice Bergen tries to woo Burt back with her terrible singing "Better than Ever"  I think that is the name of the song ..as always Jill Clayburgh was winning as ever and Burt couldn't been better too.  Its a shame Jill's middle age romance flick with Jeffrey Tambor .. "Never Again" got the due it deserved when ti came out.  Everybody should check that out, its a hoot too+dvd

A Charming bit of Camp for a Rainy Afternoon+N+As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance. +dvd
Avoid this movie-!+N+This has got to be the worst film version of an Austin story I've ever seen. The plot is only tenuously connected with the book; as for the characters, hairstyles & costumes, it should be subtitled "Fellini Does Austin" because it most closely resembles the "Satyricon" IMO. The makeup, costuming, & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically, but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that's just the lead character, Catherine. The rest are worse. Bad acting, too. Very lame film. The Austin estate should sue BBC for turning out such a turkey & using her name+dvd
a true artist+P+One of my all time favorite movies. What a great documantary and story of a very complicated man and his effect on such a vast multitude of people of all levels and across the world. And then his families, and the son who tells the story and his journey and questions, you can feel how he's attempting to grapple with all that he discovers, that inspired me. Awesome footage, and quirky interviews with some of the legendary architects of our day. Amazing job for the documentor and how he has put such a complex story together in such a simple style without over-simplifying the stories+dvd

Lackluster Lear+N+Holm is a really terrific actor, but I have a feeling his Lear is probably better served by the stage than by this rather uneven production. For one thing, he really doesn't seem old and frail enough. And the supporting cast doesn't seem particularly well thought out - or is it just the way they're directed. There are some particularly unfortunate moments where we get to see Goneril's twitching, overwrought facial reactions during Lear's lengthy outpourings of invective, and the thing would be hilarious if it weren't so hard to watch (and not in a good way). Lear shouts and everyone shouts back. There is no variation or contrast in the performances. Goneril, in particular, works better as a measured, icy presence, in my opinion. In a television production, we could still see his words cutting her as she keeps her infernal composure. The shouting matches leach the material of a lot of it's dramatic tension. It sometimes seems as if everyone is playing mad here - except, perhaps, for Michael Bryant, who gives faultless line delivery as the Fool.  I personally don't think 'Lear' has a chance of working unless as much care is given to the characters closest to him (particularly the daughters) as to Lear himself. The performances need to be developed interdependently, as the characters are interdependent. The music of the piece doesn't come out here.  Eventually, it becomes tedious+dvd
You will not find a better movie version of 1984+P+Naturally any film media can not place the entire book on the screen with maybe the exception of "Hamlet" (1996). With anything less than a mini-series. Second is it the story or the philosophy that needs to be transmitted? If you are lucky you get both.   In this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie. An added plus, you could say double plus good, was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version. The story "1984" was envisioned in 1948.   -------------------------------------------   In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith (John Hurt) is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex (Suzanna Hamilton) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member (Richard Burton) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.   If he gets caught, he will be sent to the "Ministry of Love" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.   ---------------------------------------------   This version is a little more graphic than the other two earlier commercial movies. However each movie version brings a different emphasis on this classic story. There is a 2007 version in the works  Read a review of the book "1984" by George Orwell. The movie can stand on its own merit, but knowledge of the book will help fill in the gaps and explain the inferences. Better actors could not have been picked. Richard Burton is in his element.   Many people think this is happening today.+dvd
poor adaptation+N+This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story+dvd

An Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Novel.+P+David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.  This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.  This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).  True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.  This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)  Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.    In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture. +dvd
Honorably Courageous+N+Has everything:  a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special.  It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well.  This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances!  Thank you for sending me a copy.  - +dvd
Nice date night movie!+P+Add one part love story and one part baseball sports flick and you have a great date night movie! This is a wonderful movie to watch. Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie, but more importantly the storyline is really well done. Costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career. On the last game he pitches, we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher, but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again/off again romantic relationship with Preston's character. Definitely worth watchin+dvd

"You can't escape destiny by running away."+P+Set in the sleepy German town of Bremen, the 1922 German silent film "Nosferatu" is based on the Bram Stoker novel, "Dracula." The film company was unable to obtain the rights to the story, so the names of the Stoker's main characters were changed to avoid legal complications. Bram Stoker's widow sued anyway, and won. All existing copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed by the court handling the case, but since many copies were already in circulation, "Nosferatu" was not lost.  In this version of the vampire legend, a young married man, Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is commissioned by the peculiar, repulsive Knock (Alexander Granach) to visit Count Orlock in Transylvania. Count Orlock, apparently wants to buy a house in Bremen, and Knock tells Hutter to travel to Transylvania and make the necessary arrangements with the Count. Knock tells his employee not to pay any attention to the stories of phantoms--it's all nonsense. Hutter, who imagines that he's hit the big time with this commission, travels to Transylvania leaving his wife, Ellen (Greta Schroeder) behind in the care of friends.  The trip to Transylvania builds up the suspense as Hutter travels closer and closer to the lair of the Count. Locals at an inn near the castle are full of dread, but Hutter laughs off their horror by blaming the rumours he's been warned about. Even when he's taken by coach to the castle, and dropped some way off because the coachmen fear to go closer, Hutter still proceeds on his journey. The Count's nightmare castle is incredibly atmospheric, but it isn't until Hutter slices his finger while eating dinner that it begins to dawn on him that there's something wrong with this situation. The Count--who doesn't look human--expresses an inordinate amount of interest in Hutter's blood.   While Hutter becomes the Count's next meal, his wife back in Bremen experiences horrible nightmares. Meanwhile the Count travels back to Bremen via his coffin in the cargo hold of a ship. The people back in Bremen begin to read newspaper accounts of the plague spreading throughout the region, and after Nosferatu's coffin arrives, residents are found dead in their beds. Naturally the blame falls on the plague--a disease shrouded in mystery. Fearful residents in Bremen stay isolated in their homes, but death still finds them.  The element of sexuality always evident in later vampire films also exists in the symbolic surrender of a victim as she presents her neck to Nosferatu while collapsing on her bed.  While the film is of great interest to anyone who likes silent film or German Expressionism, it's also fascinating to watch the film and see how the Dracula legend mutated over the years with various versions. Modern versions of Dracula tend to portray him as an accomplished, enigmatic seducer. Nosferatu--on the other hand--looks like a ghoul.  F.W. Murnau's film is a masterpiece of the imagination. Nosferatu is a nightmarish figure--a ghoul who rises from his coffin to relentlessly seek his food. The film--devoid of the special effects that dominate today's cinema is gripping, and the scenes of the rats pouring out of the coffin are unforgettable. This Alpha DVD was fair quality given the film's age. It was certainly watchable--one note however, in the subtitles, the original names--Count Dracula, Renfield etc. are used--displacedhuma+dvd
Big, brash and boring+N+The movie "Extreme Ops" which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it. It is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment.  Let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips. This movie has no plot and no characterization. The point appears to be to display some "amazing" stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station.  The plot, and I use the term loosely, concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film. They have been hired by a Japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche (the reason why is never really given) so this ragtag group heads for Austria. Why they made the decision to film the shot in the Alps instead of the perfectly good Rocky Mountains is similarly never explained, except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering Serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death.  Understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers. He, like the theater audience, seems to find them just as annoying as we do, but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or, even more sensibly, walking out in the middle of the movie, he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them.  I usually try to find some good points in a movie I review so it is somewhat balanced, however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say, I guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count?  Do yourself a favor and give this a miss. I would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on DVD shelves. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull, dumb movie+dvd
Shallow & self-serving & disappointing.+N+I can only agree with those other viewers who found major gaps & omissions in the "documentary". No mention of Michael Ritchie or John Boorman that I could see. But lots of footage of "hot" & "trendy" folks like Mazursky, Avildsen & Hopper. Even the bit of commentary from Friedkin, Altman & Coppola that might have given this effort some real substance is too slight & superficial to matter. It's stuff you've read or heard a thousand times before.  Too bad. They really blew it+dvd
Not as funny or creative or whimsical as the first two!+N+This Rugrats movie is the worst of the three. Obviously, it was made for promotion and cash more than anything. Nickelodeon didn't consider the plot in the process, so the movie suffers. The plot is complex, yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously, and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots. The movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp. Since Rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds, they won't get it. The main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [also, Burger King promotion to go with that], and the fact that Spike would now talk. Hah! Spike talked in the episode of the series about Chuckie's dreams. Besides, smelling some disgusting card [that you can smell anytime, not during the movie] isn't fun. The burger smells more like spoiled milk. Anyway, the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dosen't happen. Debbie's well-publicized line and the &quot;That is so wrong!&quot; line, and the Wedgie-dance, are among the stupidest things I have ever seen. Maybe an 8-year-old would disagree. Being 12, I found the humour pretty dumb. So you're aware, I love the series. This movie just wasn't creative at all, it was more of a Thornberry-type flick. And finally, it just isn't whimsical or special in any way. Not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store, if that+dvd
Review of Orson Welles &quot;It's All True&quot;.+P+A treasure for all Welles' fans. A 32 minute documentary on the failure to complete &quot;It's All True&quot; leads into a full presentation of the beautiful 46 minute B&amp;W SILENT drama documentary titled &quot;Four Men  On A Raft&quot;. An excellent modern ( Stereo ) score made up of renditions  of the Brazilian music Welles was investigating is dubbed on together with  appropriate sound effects ( wind &amp; waves etc ). Despite being on  Nitrate film stock stashed in a studio basement for over 40 years its  presented in almost perfect condition. A thrill to see what's left and  truly sad to think of what might have emerged. Included amongst the  snippets of incomplete material is just 3 minutes B&amp;W and 3 minutes  colour Rio Carnival footage and a complete 3 minute segment from &quot;My  Friend Burrito&quot;+dvd
HUGELY Disappointed. . . .+N+Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!    The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp.  Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!  +dvd
I like Lenny Bruce just fine, but...+N+I always thought of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, which I haven't seen, and the movie producer from WAG THE DOG, which I love. Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better. +dvd

I worked up a sweat with this one.+P+This is a good cardio/interval weight training workout. The entire workout is 40 minutes in length. You will need 3 to 5 pound dumbbells for the toning segments (there are 2 or 3 incorporated into the cardio workout). The instructor leads you through some classic aerobic moves then goes into one of the weight training segments in which you will still keep the entire body moving to keep the heart rate up. The kickboxing segment is good too. There is a standing abs with weights segment near the end but she doesn't do any classic floor crunches. This workout had me sweating! It took a couple of times for me to get the routines down, but it seems to be a good cardio workout to add to your fitness DVD rotations.+dvd

Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ??

My son still loves it now at 15 months and has learned to clap with the characters and he dances when the jazz song comes on.  Even my husband enjoys watching it...over and over and over.

A glorious sendoff for two fine actors. . .+P+Richard Harris and Oliver Reed inhabit roles worthy of their larger than life talents in Ridley Scott's glorious GLADIATOR.  The film has had many reviews, so my two cents are for Harris and Reed.  Everything about this marvelous, intimate epic is first-rate, and you must see it if you have not, and on a big screen TV if you can.  Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, Caesar for twenty-five years until his murder by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), brings his authority and gentility to bear, never needing to raise his voice to be absolutely In Charge.  His Caesar is a man, no more, no less, wondering if, after all these years, what does he truly leave behind?  How will History treat him?  We get to know him well through his conversations with his daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) as well as his trusted General, the son he wishes he had, Maximus (Russell Crowe).  It was close to Harris' last role, and most definitely one of his best.  Harris has played kings in the past, but never this realistically.  And what can you say about the late Oliver Reed?  Along with Harris, he was one of the last of the original Brit hellraisers, and the wear and tear on his face and body make him the perfect Proximo, former gladiator and now trying to make his fortune on other fighters.  He doesn't play Proximo, he IS Proximo.  You can't help but think of all the great roles Reed played over the years, such as Bill Sykes in OLIVER, Vulcan in BARON MUNCHAUSEN, Otto Von Bismarck in ROYAL FLASH, Athos in THE THREE and THE FOUR MUSKETEERS, HANNIBAL BROOKS in the film of the same name, and of course his performance as Gerald Crich with Glenda Jackson in WOMEN IN LOVE.  His loss was a great one for not only the filmmakers of GLADIATOR, but for all of us.  Take a look at the 200-minute documentary on Disc Two of this three DVD set and you will find a large portion devoted to Reed, his unfortunate passing only three weeks from the end of filming, and how Scott, the screenwriters and the rest of the crew of GLADIATOR brilliantly completed Reed's wonderful performance.  Oliver is probably smiling down, Guinness in hand, saying, "Good on you, mate."  GLADIATOR is an epic, to be sure, but ultimately it's about people, and how they survive in a deadly time.  Djimon Hounsou as Juba, the spiritual center of the film, Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, who wants to try to bring Rome back to Marcus Aurelius' dream, Ralf Moeller as Hagen, who comes to respect Maximus as a true leader, and all the cast turn in sterling performances.  No one but Ridley Scott could have shepherded this film to as emotionally satisfying an experience as it is. (I think he really should have gotten the Oscar on this one:  how could it be voted Best Picture, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects and Russell Crowe Best Actor without acknowledging who pulled it all together and made it work?)   See GLADIATOR, check out everything on the three discs, and savor some of the best work from two wonderful actors:  Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.  We who are about to view salute you. . +dvd
Very Funny!!+P+This show is so funny, I cannot believe that it didn't last long. The same people that created South Park made this so you know it's gonna be hilarious.

Great movie but negative+N+I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it.+dvd

If you live outside the united states DO NOT BUY!!!!+N+I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green.  STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuf+dvd
fulcis blood drenched classic+P+lucio fulcis zombi 2 is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn of the dead is a close second]and should be in every horror fans collection. people say that its a rip off of romeros films, but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead. romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre. fulcis picture is actually quite original. the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective. the zombies look amazing, much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers. fulcis zombies are rotting, decaying monsters. each one has its own original qualities. the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing. it takes like 40 minutes for the film to get going, but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest. speaking of gore, zombi 2 has plenty of it. the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film. if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly.+dvd

American Psycho - the book (1991) and the movie (2000)+P+While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever.  It is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage.  I did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it...  Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards.   The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting. His James Bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly, that your blood would freeze.  +dvd
American Psycho+P+Wow this is one crazy movie. LOL Christian Bale is one nutty dude in this movie. The world of Yuppies. One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be. Who has better looking, more expensive business cards for one example. It's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world. One is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill. He kills one acquaintance of his who he really doesn't know, and takes him for another person. Of course Jared Leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are, and gets killed in this movie to, and he is actually the first murder victim. His place is also where Christian's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them.  This movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers. It's very well done, and Bale gives a very compelling performance. I call it Yuppieville. 5* rating, it has all the elements of a great thriller.+dvd
&quot;a true rapper&quot;+P+this dvd is great, this dvd shows the real tupac just like the other reviewers said.. one thing puzzled me this whole time ever since tupac got murdered..is he dead or alive?? i've been putting alot of thought into this.. i came to a conclusion, but i'm not really sure.. my conclusion is that he could still be alive.. after he got shot he was of course rushed to the hospital, then some how he survived the shots, then after that he probably told the FBI or the Cops or whatever that he doesn't want the public to know if he's dead or alive, the reason to this?? i think because if the public knew then of course the  gangsters that put this whole murder plot up would know too.. this way the gangsters dunno if he's dead or alive so they cant do anytin anymore about tupac..tupac is probably livin in a paradise sum where in this world far away from the public and the FBI is probably supportin him by giving him food and all that stuff...of course my theory can probably be wrong.. I guess God will only know &amp; the FBI..+dvd
When Hippies Make Movies+N+I had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while, being a big Sellers fan and a Ringo/Beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie. It is neither. Perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself. The idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both Sellers and Starr to shine, but the script and story (what there was of it) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to. One strange setting after another ends anti-climatically, which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity. It really does seem that they "wrote" it as they went along, if there was anything written at all. And one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed+dvd
Here's A Puzzler: Who's The Most Loathsome Cast Member?+N+I am being generous in giving this film two stars. I saw a trailer for it, and while it looked intriguing, looks can be deceiving, much like the bulk of this would-be psychological potboiler. I think the photography work and acting deserve a minimum of two stars as both were excellent; the general storyline, however, was drivel.   Many reviewers have noted how the film fundamentally makes no sense, and there are parts where I agree wholeheartedly. I don't mind thought-provoking films that leave you wondering what actually happened, but this was mostly in the shallow end from the standpoint of plot construction. It is inconceivable to me how the two female leads (Charlotte Rampling, and Ludivine Sagnier) could tolerate one another; further, it is incomprehensible why Rampling didn't merely leave France when Sagnier started making her life miserable. To believe that Rampling would actually help Sagnier conceal murder is impossible. Yes, I know that the entire character of the daughter is ambiguous by the end, but inasmuch as the character was constructed in Rampling's mind to be a murderess negates charges of cinematic intellectual superiority and holds Rampling's judgment suspect.  The entire movie is filled with characters that are excruciating to watch, and the only real reason for a two star rating is that the actors do an outstanding job in their roles. I considered briefly watching the film a second time to make sure I understood all the nuances, but I just hated it too much the first time to give it a second chance. This is one film that looks positively great as a two minute theatrical trailer, but looks positively awful in the light of day as a hulking 103 minute feature.   I am very open-minded to unusual, imported, and avant-garde films, but while this movie had touches of all three, I was merely relieved when it was over.+dvd
If you like movies from Focus Features...+P+If you like movies from Focus Features... you should see this one+dvd
Jayne wanted to be in a Cary Grant movie at all cost,and the result is a DISASTER+N+Poor Jayne,and the mistakes she made in her short film career.Read any biography about Jayne,and you will have to agree that she should have never accepted this role.Why did she do it? Her life-long competition with Marilyn is the only explanation.MM had been in a Cary Grant movie (Monkey Business),so Jayne just had to do the same.Interestingly enough,in the 2 Cary Grant biographies I read,the film is not even mentionned...Jayne fighting for the attention of Grant with the beautiful model turned actress,Suzy Parker,ends up looking like a female-impersonator,and not a good one.In 1957 Jayne was in a position where she could have refused that tacky role,but instead she sure is in this bomb.Cary Grant was obviouly in it for the money,and his 'I'm so cool,i can't believe it-kind of acting' just doesn't cut it this time.Jayne is the fifth wheel,and just looks like she doesn't belong-No chemistry whatsoever,and everyone in the film looks embarrassed for her.Even her clothes don't even have the feeling of a movie that is supposed to be set in the  1940's.You end up with the feeling that she is an unwelcomed guest on the film-set. Get the DVD,but don't pay more than a buck for it +dvd
an incredible movie and riveting performance+P+I don't think I've ever rented a movie twice before, but I did rent "Lost" twice.  And now, on top of that, I've bought it.  For me, that's a lot of money, and a lot of time, to spend on a single movie.  In this case, it's more than worth it.    I've never seen anything like this movie.  It absolutely gripped me.  The performance by Dean Cain was so real, so utterly convincing, that it is hard for me to escape the idea that it all actually happened to him, personally.  And nothing anyone else did in the movie detracted from that sense that I was watching real events unfold and spiral out of control.    I've seen one person shows before but they were always the type where the audience is very aware that it is a performance.  You know the type of thing I'm talking about - a venerable actor on a stage - perhaps a stool and a glass of water - a bare card table - a spotlight...  This was virtually a one person performance but I didn't even realize it until a day or two after the first time I watched it.  The fact that Dean Cain carries the whole movie isn't necessarily obvious because it isn't the point of the movie.  The writing, photography, directing and acting (especially the acting) are so layered, nuanced, complex, rich, that it satisfies on every emotional and intellectual level, without additional on-screen characters, or glitzy locations.  If this movie strikes a chord in someone, as it did in me, the bleakness of the landscape, the heat, the sun's passage across the sky, the weather changes, all become internalized.  Their shifts will become your shifts, and you may feel the connections of the land to the character and events as they become a part of you.  You may experience the longings and desires, the sadnesses and fears, that led to the passing moments, and underlie them.  And you may not be able to shake them.+dvd
Brett takes your breath away+P+If I was going to hire an escort he is the one I would want. Penelope and Brett made a great couple. Her father -in- law wanted her to date again after losing her husband on a bucking bull. She has to convince him she has a boyfriend so he quits sending every eligible bachelor in town to her office. Brett shows up and steals the show. He stands up to her father -in-law and wins the respect of the whole town.  This is an excellent movie+dvd
Wilderness Videos are the best+P+Excellent for nice viewing and music. Wilderness has scenery with very few people, excellent music and I have the whole set. Wish they did more+dvd
WHO NEEDS EXTRAS??+P+These films stand on their own as great films and great examples of DeMille's unique brand of film making.  They don't need 'extra features' to hype them.  I was also glad to see the inclusion of 'Four Frightened People' which is quite different from DeMille's usual epic style.  The packaging of the set is actually quite good, with single-sided disks and an attractive slip case.  The film quality is excellent, considering the fact that these films are over 70 years old.  Overall, an outstanding collection at a relatively reasonable price.   +dvd
Ever seen a made at home movie? Nows your chance! +N+... Now how do you start a review of this kind of movie.  Was it a movie?  When all of a DOZEN towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the (wonderfully computer rendered)dragons doesn't that just somehow seem sad. We six Heros will die so that the dragons won't eat the rest of you!  Thats right all 11 of...oh Im sorry didn't see you there, ALL TWELVE of you.  I especially like how in this town of twelve+heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy, a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels,(talk about envy) and the robin hood guy, except he's actually from outside the town.  So I'm going to stop now before I cry... Yes it was that bad.  But as always watch it for the Heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing..experience thing+dvd
My favorite movie...+P+I liked the deleted scenes...too bad they took them out from the general audiences.  Those scenes made for a more powerful human story...too powerful for civilians, I guess.  Excellent movie+dvd
Legends Of The Dull+N+More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff+dvd
What experts are saying...+P+It is a big step forward in cutting edge presentation of XC images and educational materials. Combining loads of hot shot footage and a pumping alt.rock soundtrack, both the video and DVD are a perfect presentation or backdrop to a club potluck, overnight trip, or snow dance party. Mostly promotional in nature rather than oriented to technique, that is enough right there to separate this beast from the pack. There is something for just about anyone. The DVD puts them eons ahead of the rest of the XC pack) has tons of extra goodies. A great time-eater on airplanes destined to get your whole area of the plane craning their necks (we know, we tried it :-). - Cross Country Ski World and American Cross Country Skiers  Finalist at the Banff Mountain Film Festival and chosen by Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival in "Best of the Fest" tour.  "Awesome x-c ski video" - Cross Country Canada  "Technically, it's excellent. This video offers great angles and exciting action shots.

Hard-bitten fun in glorious black and white+P+An armored car driver (Burt Lancaster) involves himself in a robbery scheme in order to protect both himself and his ex-wife (Yvonne de Carlo), whom he still loves and is now married to a local gangster (Dan Duryea).  This is a hard, uncompromising example of film noir, featuring great performances and generating true suspense.  The finale of this film is certainly no cop-out and demonstrates that, although films of the 40s were not as graphic as those of today, they were nevertheless often edgier and tougher than most of what comes out now+dvd
Barbarella's influence on pop-culture...!+P+OK, we all know that Duran Duran got their name from the evil doctor in Barbarella, but Barbarella's influence on pop-culture extends far beyond that!  Fans of X-men will notice that when the Great Tyrant captures Pygar, it's identical (practically frame by frame) to the introduction of Callisto and the Morlocks in #169 (X-men fans, pull out your issues, you'll see what I'm talking about).  Demolition Man (sorry, I love campy movies), uses many of the elements of the "perfect society" that Barbarella comes from - down to the way they have sex (sitting next to each other with your hands up).  There are many others, but I'll let you discover them for yourselves+dvd
What shark??+N+I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else+dvd
possibly the most boring film I have seen...+N+Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces.+dvd
A delightful comedy+P+For anyone who enjoys good acting, wonderful plot and enjoyable drama this is a must.  For those not familiar with Shakespeare this is a fabulous introduction to his comedies+dvd
Where's Boris?+P+The only reason I knocked off a star is, I was disappointed that in a couple of the movies, Boris is hardly in them.  It is really stretching to include them as a collection of his movies.  Other than that, the quality is first rate.  And I was glad they gave us three discs, instead of one double-sided one, like they have done in the past.  I don't know if Universal didn't have more in their library to choose from, but it is painfully obvious in The Black Castle, that Boris and Lon are just making cameos to try market it as a horror movie. +dvd
A little cheesy, but an all time classic+P+Considering that this movie came out in 1951, the special effects aren't too bad.  The acting is alright, and anyone that understands astronomy would understand many things in this movie just aren't possible.  Putting that aside, its just a neat old movie, that I had to add to the DVD collection+dvd
Good Film - For Some People+P+Straight to the point. . . .there are a lot of mixed reviews here, but I would say that this movie is a really good film. Now, i'm in to the quirky, eye-catching, think you can't stomach what is going on with this film kinda movies that have young up and coming actors/actresses in it. Bijou Philips can always be spotted in most of the films, that's how you know it might fit the mold. Anyway, if you aren't into the crazy larry clark films such as "Kids" and "Bully", or any movies such as that, then this probably won't interest you a bit. Oh, and to that reviewer at the top. . . Megzi i believe their name was. . . .Mischa Barton who is great in the film, she doesn't throw on a fake english accent in the movie. . . she really is from London. . . do your research first+dvd
MASTERFUL NOTHINGNESS+N+Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it+dvd
Semi-thrilling Thriller+N+This film is so stupid that when different locations in Quebec are shown the captions read "St. Jovite, Canada" or Montreal, Canada" like mentioning Quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for.  Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here.  The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!!  Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly.  She should have been the lead.  She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week+dvd
A Complete Reason For Seeing This Movie+P+Well as all my acquaintances know I'd go to see anything Angelina Jolie appeared in, even if she's in it for only two minutes.  Years ago Pauline Kael pronounced that "By now Jane Fonda has become a complete reason for going to the movies" (probably around the time of KLUTE) and it's been apparent for some time that Jolie is the spiritual descendant of Jane Fonda.  Think of them, each one the wild, tormented daughter of a great matinee idol with a cleancut image.  And neither one with a super great range, but both excellent at what they do: Jane was terrific at denoting "modernity" (to Kael, she carried forth Bette Davis' attitude of purring like a perfectly kept motor), while Jolie is all about being the "wife's worst nightmare."  TAKING LIVES is only about one inch deep, and the trailer tells it all, but why not see it anyhow?  Either you're in thrall to her giant lips and long arms, her downcast gaze and humungous tattoos (here covered up for the most part)--or you're not.  Playing Ileanna Scott, ace FBI profiler in serial murders, isn't much of a stretch for Jolie, for nowadays all you have to do is immerse yourself in a room filled with horrid photos of the killer's crimes and then drift into a trance state where you become the killer; then you wake up gasping like a fish and you shout out, "He uses toothpaste to sedate them!" and everyone goes on the alert for Crest sales.  Ileanna's pregnancy is a dilly especially watching the film in early 2006, a time of great world strife during which no magazine cover appears without a mention of Brad and Angelina's forthcoming baby.  One of the few shock moments of the movie involve a threat to Ileanna's baby, too gross to go into here.  I remember during the filming of this movie the paparazzi caught a tender moment between Jolie, her son Maddox, and her French co-star here Olivier Martinez, best known for dating the Australian pop star Kylie Minogue.  Angelina and Olivier took little Maddox to his first ball game, and the next thing you knew, Kylie was flying across to Montreal to pay an impromptu set visit.  Well, I suppose Angelina was innocent that time, or as innocent as she gets.  She waited until MR AND MRS SMITH to play her full ace of hearts.  And Olivier and Kylie are still together as of this writing, hooray+dvd
What is this complete and utter insanity?!?!+N+What is this complete and utter insanity?!?!  This &quot;Set 2&quot; was supposed to include Woody Allen's VERY best &quot;little&quot; film &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;!!!  &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; and no &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;?? &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; is an excruciating waste of time.  &quot;September&quot;?  &quot;Another Woman&quot;?  &quot;Alice&quot;?  And no &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;?  The only picture worth bothering with in this &quot;Set 2&quot; is &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; which is not only one of Allen's most brilliant movies, but just generally brilliant. What is the deal?  What is the problem?  Where is &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;?+dvd

"I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive."+N+You'd have to go a long way to find a group of people as unpleasant as those depicted in Christophe Honore's film "Ma Mere." When the film begins, Pierre (Louis Garrel) arrives from boarding school in France to spend the summer with his wealthy parents in Gran Canaria. His father (Philippe Duclos) rattles off some sort of heart-to-heart talk with his son about not really being the sort of person he's become, but Pierre is clearly bored and spoilt, and asks, "can I go now?"   Pierre's father returns to France and is abruptly killed in an accident. This leaves Pierre alone with his mother, Helene (Isabelle Huppert) and their two long-suffering servants. There's no period of mourning--although Pierre does discover--and foul--his dad's secret stash of naughty magazines, but then the film settles in to its main theme--the tortured Oedipal relationship that exists between Pierre and Helene.   With Pierre's father gone, Helene is clearly unleashed, and together with Pierre, this mother-and-son team begins the odyssey of Pierre's total and complete debauchment. Apparently this isn't difficult to achieve in a city full of holidaymakers and swingers who bravely sport outfits consisting of jockstraps and sequins. Plus Helene spares no time in introducing her son to her friend, Rea (Joana Preiss)--who is, apparently, "the wildest woman" in Helene's wild acquaintance. Helene acts sometimes as a voyeur to her son's debasement, and sometimes as a participant. And it's all rather no-holds barred, revolting stuff.   Isabelle Huppert is known for accepting risky roles--consider "The Piano Teacher" for example--a marvelous film that stretched boundaries. "Ma Mere" does more than stretch boundaries--it's an over-the-top kinkfest that sinks rapidly into scene after scene of revolting, purposeless and demeaning encounters. The only joy to be had here is the silly self-righteousness one occasionally indulges in from watching the antics of the filthy rich who have nothing to do all day but engage in depraved activities. Huppert, as always, acts her heart out, but after a while, the film just becomes an exercise in how much the viewer will tolerate. In French with English subtitles--displacedhuma+dvd

Still Terrific After All These Years+P+#51 on the American Film Institute's Top 100 List, "The Philadelphia Story" is a 1940 comedy that has never lost its popularity. It's the film that rekindled Katherine Hepburn's then-ailing film career, the only movie James Stewart ever won an Oscar for, and a movie that Cary Grant demanded a huge salary for. Surprisingly, the movie is actually funny to this very day.   Grant plays C.K. Dexter Haven, a millionaire who has recently separated from his wife Tracy Lord (Hepburn). Now, Tracy is getting remarried and Dexter has hired two people from the gossip magazine Spy to cover the marriage. They are Macaulay Connor (Stewart) and Elizabeth Imbrie. Neither one is happy to be there. Connor is on the verge of quitting his job at the Spy, as he fancies himself a writer and is sick of writing gossip articles. Elizabeth fancies herself a painter and is sick of taking photographs of rich people. Pretty soon, Connor finds himself falling for Tracy as Dexter finds himself falling for her again.  Stewart deserved his Oscar as he steals every scene he's in. As I said, the film is still very funny to this day (a rarity, since comedy has changed so much over the years). Anyway, "The Philadelphia Story" is not my favorite film of all time. It think there's plenty of films on the list placed beneath it that are much better, but "The Philadelphia Story" is a charming film that is definitely worth your time. GRADE: A+dvd
This wasn't  Orson  Welles' movie.  so we don't have the+P+expense or baggage of an original Welles production. He was hired to direct & act. The movie was made to make money & therefore to be done under budget. Welles succeeded & did an excellent, stylish, directing job. In a bit of over-acting he also played the part of creepy Dr. Charles Rankin, formerly Franz Kindler, Nazi war criminal to perfection. This now an old fashioned movie but 1946 was the perfect time for it's subject: Nazis hiding in our midst, such as a small town in Connecticut.   This film noir drama may have been made on the cheap but it's stars are first rate. Besides Welles, Edward G. Robinson plays title role, & comes to town under the guise of an antique dealer. He is actually a federal Nazi hunter on the trail of Franz Kindler. Loretta Young is perfecting her role as the idiot wife of Kindler/Dr. Rankin.  You might remember her as David Nevin's stupid spouse in The Bishp's Wife several years later. Kindler is embedded as a professor at a private prep school. He seems to be popular with the boys.    About half way through the movie, Mr. Wilson has a pretty good idea who Dr. Rankin really is. The climax is to be expected but is still well done, on a subject that still of interest today, facism in America+dvd
Great, but I missed subtitles in spanish+P+I loved all three chapters of this DVD, as well as Poirot Set 2.  The menu is easy to use, the quality of the picture is incredible, etc.  The only thing I missed, where the subtitles in Spanish.  I speak fluently English, so that was not a problem.  So, if you are going to buy this DVD and dont know English, dont buy it, unless you want to learn.  And the sound is a little soft, so dont forget to turn the volume down when the DVD is over...  Hope this was helpful, and have a great day+dvd
Not what my daughter expected+N+My 4-year old daughter fell in love with MLP after watching the "Princess Promenade" DVD, so when we saw this, we scooped it up.  After watching princess promenade though, watching this was torture.  The animation and audio are so poorly done.  Every story has a scary character that terrified my 4-year old.  The cover resembles the princess promenade disk as far as imagery, but doesn't match the video at all.  It seems deceptive.  Only after my dissapointment did I note the 1987 production date.  If I can return this, I will, because my daughter is too scared to watch it+dvd
Very well done neo-noir+P+Brian DePalma's Blow Out is a taut thriller that would make Hitchcock proud. The Master of Suspense loved to put his characters in situations where they had to sit by helplessly while events occur beyond their control - the best example of this is Rear Window - and DePalma uses that technique to great effect in the finale of Blow Out.  John Travolta plays Jack, a Philadelphia movie sound man who witnesses a car accident one night while he is out recording audio on a bridge. He manages to rescue Sally (Nancy Allen) from the wreckage, but another man - who we later find out is the front-running Presidential candidate McRyan - is left for dead.  After reviewing his recording of the accident, Jack determines that this was no accident. He believes that somebody deliberately shot out the tire, but who, and why? When video of the accident surfaces, shot by a man named Karp (Dennis Franz), Jack begins to suspect that both Sally and Karp know more than they're letting on.  We also see glimpses of a vigilante psychopath, played by John Lithgow, but who is he, and what are his motives? Jack is determined to find out the truth and unravel the conspiracy, but despite many clues that this wasn't an accident, nobody else seems to want to investigate any further. Jack is also scared that now that the assassins have achieved their goal, anyone who might discover that this was no accident must be eliminated, including himself and Sally, to whom he has developed an attachment.  Blow Out is an excellent film that entertains on many levels - plus it takes place in my fair city of Philadelphia. It doesn't dumb anything down for the audience, and the characters manage to act like any of us could see ourselves acting if placed in the same situations. Thumbs up.+dvd
DVD badly produced+N+I love the sound of Il Divo, but this DVD has very bad sound.  There are many times when you cannot hear the singing and when you can the sound quality is not good.  This has nothing to do with the singers; it has to do with the sound engineer.  This DVD is not worth the cost+dvd
When the death dies for love!+P+If you are one of those people who still doubts the movie is far from being an artistic ecpression; come to Cocteu's world and please convince by yourself about the veracity of this affirmation.  Cocteau adapted the classic Orpheus's myth to the present times, but keeping the essential basis of the myth and its veil's mystery. The poetry literally loads the picture all along the way.  Blood of a poet constitutes undoubtedly, the first reference step you must ascend to higher peaks. The surrealist airs are present with all the frenzy of the First Opus; rapture images and seductive illusion, irreverence and disobey; a real captive journey through the Fourth Wall where the dreams and love live.  In Orpheus,we will assist to the dramatic premise: Orpheus is obsessed with his wife's death. Heuterbise and Cegeste will his fellows friends and his lamentations and complaints are at last satisfied when he will get the opportunity to get through the frontier between the life and death. She will visit to his beloved wife in clear reference to Dante and Beatrice but he will sign a pact with the underworld's Jury: he will return with his beloved wife with jus one condition: he won't be able to watch her under any pretext or reason.   To look behind: this is the most important reflection that feeds not only this fabulous myth but even an apparent far distant work as Faust: to look behind means to be frozen in the time's shadows; and Faust through the decision of becoming to the dead youth will establish his own agreement with Satan. But you have more: When Lot's wife in the Christian mythology looks behind becomes in salt's statue. The memories constitue a real matrix: it's seductive, the enviroment temperature is so warm and seductive that you can be engaged through your entire life. Narcisus comes to our mind when the human being, once has reached the experience's stage, pretendes, mistakenly, to get back to the ancestral origin: the naive innocence. If you decide to get back, you are committed to pay a prize, that's why Orpheus will be murdered in the Hades.  Finally in Orpheus' testament we assist to the last farewell of the poet. Inquired by the Great Jury Cocteau answers: "A film is the petrified image of the mind which resurrects the dead acts". He will be punished to live in his final days till the time will come for him to fade. The final encounter with Oediphus literally will invade you of perplexity and cosmic anguish; to be so close and unable to meet one each other.  Consider this film not only one of the twenty giants films one any age ever made but one of the ten top French films and perhaps one the three most admired and perfect film in the whole cinema's story. The other two to my mind would be: Carne 's Children of the paradise and Robert Bresson 's A man escapes.  When a rose vanishes, the poetry will wait for it and the cycle will start over and over!     +dvd
Smiling is my favorite!+P+This may be my new favorite movie. Will Ferrel is fantastic - the music is wonderful, and I could not stop watching it over and over+dvd
Critics missed this one...+P+...and they caused me to pass it up for about 20 years, too.  I don't recall many kind words about this movie when originally released.  Most reviewers never got past the notorious scene -- you know the one I mean.  How sad.  Anyway, I took their word for it, movie sucks, don't waste your time.  They were so wrong.  I finally saw it this weekend.  Wow.  What an outstanding little thriller.  And, I gotta say, a fairly important film.  Along with Jacob's Ladder, this seems to anticipate almost every major thriller of the past 15 years.  But this one came first, and it may be the stronger film.  Rourke is terrific.  Seeing this, it's hard not to wonder how different his career might have gone if the critics hadn't chosen to make him their personal whipping boy.  I'm not quite ready now to rush out and snag copies of 91/2 Weeks and Wild Orchid, but I'm thinking about it.  They were so wrong about this one...maybe these others weren't celluloid vomit, either.  Anyway, excellent film.  If you're a horror / thriller / mystery fan, and have steered away from this one because you didn't want to see the Cosby kid defiled, I'd encourage you to give it a chance.  And if as it unfolds you're thinking, man, this is pretentious trash...well, hang in there.  When the story is over you might feel differently.  Only complaint.  DeNiro's character's name.  Come on.  As effective as the movie was, it might have been that much more so if they hadn't telegraphed DeNiro's character every step of the way+dvd
Widescreen Or HD Blueray ?+N+i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it's release why? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on HD or Blueray or a new 2 disc DVD set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie..+dvd
Feedback from Real Apache "Calculus Wiz"+N+I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching.  I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies.  Examples include "Death Hunt," the 80s "Death Wish" series, and "the White Buffalo."  But his acting in this movie is unrealistic.  He does not act like a real Apache.  Bronson seems to overdo it on being "stoic."  A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels.  Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache.  Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in "Hombre," which I purchased on Amazon.  I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s.  Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead.  He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the "Undefeated," which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years)+dvd
Simple movie with a profound commentary on relationships+P+A very simple story of a very simple guy who follows his hormones to self-delusion and destruction.  He does not make relationships but always keeps women just close enough for his hedonist fulfillment and in the end realizes he is only fooling himself.  An admiring friend provides the mirror that helps him see himself as he really is.  But can the love of his life ever trust him or has he burned all his bridges too late to recover what really matters?  A good lesson on relationships and the price of a promiscuous life. +dvd
Pretty good.+P+I like having sporting events on DVD vs. VHS.  Quality of this one is good.  Don't expect too many 'extra' features.  If you want a good recap of the 2001 Masters, this will do.  The post tournament conference with Tiger is pretty interesting too to watch+dvd
How Far We've Come+P+When I watched this classic documentary, I couldn't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here, we just wouldn't make it. What it took for Inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls, body-piercing, Hummers and rap music, underneath it all is a heritage that is raw, rich and admirable; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up. It would be interesting to produce Nanook II and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now.+dvd
CHILDS PLAY+N+THIS MOVIE WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OLDER PEOPLE WILL NOYT UNDERSTAND IT+dvd
Ah. I spent to much to rent this+N+I was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from Brotherhood of the Wolf. What a disappointment. I fast forward through alot but still couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. The plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a TV shows+dvd
Tobe Hooper? Richard Matheson? Masters of Horror? What happened??+N+One of the most eagerly awaited episodes in Showtime's Masters of Horror series, Dance of the Dead is sadly disappointing.  Now granted, it's been a long time since Tobe Hooper, the craftsman behind the legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has done anything remotely spectacular, but the potential was here.  Based on a great story by I Am Legend author Richard Matheson (and adapted by his son, Richard Christian Matheson), Dance of the Dead revolves around a Mad Max-ish post-apocalyptic future in which a sheltered girl (Jessica Lowndes) gets in with a bad boy (a beefed-up Jonathan Tucker, from the 2003 re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre) who does work for the MC (genre icon Robert Englund) of a club that does some very different performances than you would expect, only to learn a shocking truth about her family.  What's the most disappointing here is Hooper's techniques, which are quite a number of quick flashes, edits, and cuts; which were most likely done to give the story a tripped out feel, but only distract the viewer.  Not to mention that a majority of the cast are so bad delivering some truly atrocious dialogue (Lowndes and Tucker are the only ones who don't seem to be sleepwalking) that the episode has an overly campy feel to it, and the music (allegedly by Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan) is nu-metal drivel that is as derivative as Hooper's directing techniques.  It's a shame, there was a lot of potential here between Hooper, the story, and the cast; but it all got wasted.  There's some nice moments here and there (the apocalyptic flashback sequence is very nicely done), but there's not enough here to make Dance of the Dead what it could have been+dvd
Underrated, Entertaining+P+This is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics.  There IS some clumsiness to it--the use of flashbacks towards the end doesn't work.  They seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy, exciting pace it is in the final movie, and to add a little of that during the final part, which after Horn is arrested moves at a slower pace.    But the movie is still well-made, well-acted, and plenty entertaining. This is a revisionist western that doesn't downplay--well, doesn't downplay excessively--Horn's stature as a killer of men.  In the movie, Horn isn't reluctant to fire the first shot, or to keep shooting after a man is down.  When one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town, for example, Horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud, probably mortally wounded, Horn unnecessarily shoots him again. In the film, it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out.  Horn comes off as something of a hapless, easily-manipulated rube in the movie--which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was. He's an idiot savant, of sorts, a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people, but inept at living in the civilized world. When he learns that he is being accused of killing the Nickell boy, not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence, he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself.    We remain sympathetic to Horn, though.  When we see him kill, he's always killing men much, much worse than himself.  The world is not a worse place for their departure.  And he's a helluva shot.  We Americans love a great shot+dvd
Zombies with obfuscate+N+Last night I watched The Gates of Hell, aka City of the Living Dead. It's an Italian horror flick made by Lucio Fulci. Fulci may be best known for his movie Zombie! in which an eyeball is pierced in slow-motion by a sliver of wood, and in which a zombie battles a great white shark (with predictable results). Personally, I find Fulci's movies confusing, boring (aside from a few key scenes), and just plain bad. The cut scenes are abrupt and often make no sense. The "good" scenes in The Gates of Hell include a drill press to Bob's head, and a teenager puking up all her internal organs. The movie is set in New England, which makes the recurring howler monkey sound effects entertaining. And when the dead all awaken, the sound effect is of crinkling cellophane layered over howler monkeys, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it.  Or not+dvd
A Movie That Echoes+P+The great thing about this movie is just how believable it is. Some people I have shown it to actually thought that Eddie and Cruisers were a real band and that the movie was a docudrama. The characters have faults and failings and are believable, the plot is classic rock'n'roll mythology, the music is original (mostly) and great.   John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band provide the real voice of Eddie Wilson and these guys can really rock. This soundtrack rates in my top 50 favorite albums to this day.  "What I want is songs that echo" says Eddie, and oh and they do. Both score and movie are still fresh and relevent today.  The only Rock'n'Roll movie I like better is Eddie Lives! (out now) together they tell one of the best R'n'R myths ever. Get both NOW!+dvd
You'll Never Get Rich+N+This is not one of Fred's better efforts,  the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners.  Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films.  In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching+dvd
Perfect+N+My friend and I randomly found this movie at the rental place and were in for a good laugh, so we rented it. We were right when we were looking for a laugh. It was probably the worst acting I've ever seen. Not to mention, completely plotless. The whole idea behind this movie is ridiculous; from the zen-like janitor to the 'popstar's greatest fear: taking a math test. Please buy or rent this movie. Its horrible nature seriously entertains+dvd
A must-buy  for animations lovers!+P+Bought this HD DVD without having seen the film previously, so it was a risk....and I won! I absolutely enjoyed it from begining to end. This film is very under-rated. It's witty, well done and clever...unlike all these stupid animal films that are out now.  Buy this film even if you haven't seen it....you won't regret it+dvd
Exactly what I wanted!+P+This DVD is exactly what I was looking for - a plain "old-fashioned" aerobics class like the ones I attended back in the early 90s when I lost a lot of weight.  I put some back on over the last few years and I knew that aerobics would be the thing to help me.  All the classes at all the gyms around here are "specialized" - Pilates, yoga, spinning, step, etc.  - and not what I wanted. I have seen Gilad's shows on Fit TV but I hated the commercials.  So I went looking for a DVD and bought this one.  I love it...I was exhausted after it was done but I felt great. It is good for all levels.  If you want a great, challenging and motivated aerobic workout, this is the DVD for you+dvd
Disappointing 70s world war 2 flick.+N+Bad special effects as far as the model work goes.  Stupid love story that you have to fast forward through.  60s hairdos on what are supposed to be 1940s women.  It's just low budget and lame+dvd
Hybrid of Sixth sense and Psyco+P+I am really tired of watching "Sixth Sense genre" movies where dead people hang out with alive through out the movie and at the end give obvious creepyness. This movie also has a dead sister hanging out with the other alive one and at the end gives the chilling creepyness. But the originality of this movie is there is no ghosts; the dead sister is only a creepy imagination of psyco sister that is still alive.  Actually I enjoyed more watching two sisters taking care of eachother. They are adorable together. I think i am gonna keep this movie.+dvd
Loved it!!+P+Okay, first off i make it a point to not say anything about the plot, characters, etc. when writing a review on this site. However, let me say this, I watched the whole series, all 21 episodes, in 2 days...and yes i have a full time job! I could not stop watching! I found that this series, not unlike Gantz and a few other that i have recently picked up, was incredible. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is even remotely into anime. And on a side note, i wounder if one of the animators work on Fooly Cooly (sp?). There were several scene where i noticed similaritie+dvd
Romeo Must Kiss Juliet+N+Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out.  Romeo must kiss Juliet.  Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky.  A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers+dvd
FANTASTIC+P+I wasn't sure about this when I ordered it, but it was a HIT!  Its a new favorite, and everyone who hears it, raves.  Beautiful stage, great music+dvd
another Van Damme flop+N+purely for fans of crappy Van Damme movies again like I says. really corny from beginning to end. Paul Sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one. Rob Schnider is wasted and WHY THE HELL WAS HE IN THIS I will have no clue. Van Damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in Double Team. with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said HEY!!!! damnit, lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here+dvd
Way over-rated.+N+I read so much about how "creepy" these Holy Grail of movies were. Luckily, I did not buy the set. I rented it from a local store in Philadelphia. I suggest renting them before making a purchase. I thought these movies were extremely dull, and not in the least frightening. Tombs is the best of the four movies. But, it is really all downhill to the end. Unless you're a Blind Dead fanboy, save your money+dvd
Not good. +N+Most of the time I love French films. 400 Blows, Breathless, etc. This one caught my eye so I bought it. Waste of $$. Horrible. I never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one. It was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound. I looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep.+dvd
The Weasel fails to deliver the goods...bud-dy!!+N+Pauly "The Weasel" Shore stars as himself in this movie about well, himself as he goes threwout the movie, backtracking and tracking forward on how his career went down the drain. He had hit movies, Son-In-Law, Encino Man, In The Army Now, Bio-Dome and Jury Duty. He had a failed Fox TV show and no one liked him anymore. He keeps bugging fellow actors to ask the director for a spot in their movie. Anyway, Shore gets a visit from the "Ghost of Sam Kinison" and Kinison tells him you'll be famous if you're dead. So, Pauly Shore fakes his own death and everyone mourns him, even his # 1 fan Bucky (W. Earl Brown) but soon everyone finds out that he faked his death, so he goes to Celebrity Prison, everyone hates him. In prison, Shore shacks up with Todd Bridges and has encounters with Heidi Fleiss, Tommy Lee and Carlos Gomez. Soon, Shore wants to be known as Pauly Shore the actor, not The Weasel anymore. Funny in a bunch of parts and cameos are scattershot as well...some cameos include Ben Stiller, Tom Sizemore, Michael Madsen, Britney Spears, Bill Maher, Paris and Nicky Hilton, Fred Durst, Andy Dick, Mario Lopez, Carrot Top, Vince Vaughn, Rico Suave, Dustin Diamond, Charlie Sheen, Verne Troyer, Clint Howard, Sean Penn, Kurt Loder, Pamela Anderson, Dr. Dre, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Mewes, Kato Kaelin, Snoop Dogg, Thommy Chong, Ja Rule, Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Corey Feldman, Rick Ducommmun, Mark McGrath, Montell Williams, Perry Ferrell, Matt Pinfield, Taylor Negron, Jerry Springer, Adam Sandler (voice only) and many others. Deep down, The Weasel fails to deliver the goods. Pauly Shore Is Dead, dies along the wa+dvd
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE......this movie+P+This movie is soo good.  I think that anyone will love this movie its funny but also heart-warming!+dvd

Wonderful movie with many outdore scenes a realy romantic and funny movie , High Quality transfer . Recommended .+dvd
Man Hating Hollywood. +N+The plot is of this film is built around Hal, Jack Black's character, being a "shallow" beauty obsessed man who one day finds that he is no longer capable of noticing a woman's exterior appearance. Thanks to Tony Robbins and his Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hal can only see a woman's internal beauty. Is there any legitimacy to such a premise in the first place? Of course not. It's totally ridiculous. One reason is that obesity correlates with mental disorders like depression and obsession-compulsion. The real question is why are these individuals incapable of controlling their own behavior? It certainly isn't due to their being more picturesque "inside" than the rest of us. More importantly, Hal's true self is far deeper rather than the Robbinized one; we see the hypnotized Hal pleasing obese women everywhere while he actively working against his own interests and those of humanity. When he was categorizing women based on their physical fitness and beauty he was practicing a form of selection that allowed us to be among the most successful species on earth. His choice gave him excellent odds of mating with a women who happened to be fertile and also strong enough to survive pregnancy. Contrast this with what happened after he was placed under the conjurer's spell as his reproductive chances immediately evaporated. A porcine woman is one less likely to be fecund, and also one more likely to contract diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and ovarian cancer  along with producing babies who are afflicted with omphalocele and various other birth defects.  There's nothing shallow about avoiding obese women. The fact is it's the height of intelligence. Such a predisposition is highly refined and highly recommended. That we have evolved to the point of castigating men who desire healthy mates is merely another indicator of society-wide misandry and our  reflexive habit of condemning what is male while fawning over what is female.+dvd
The truth about Tibet+P+I visited Tibet last summer and experienced the amazing Tibetan people and culture which are rapidly disappearing because of the Chinese. I stayed at a monastery that was slowly being rebuilt after being destroyed and the rinpoche murdered in the 1950s. This beautiful and well-made film documented all that happened to the Tibetans during the Cultural Revolution  and made me cry. Why has the west turned its back on Tibet+dvd
A True Treat for any Doris Day Fan!+P+To finally be able to see this terrific Doris Day variety show in all it's restored color and fantastic sound was something to behold! Day looks and sings like a dream and it's just ashame that she did not do more of these types of shows at this point in her career. The highlights for me were to be able to view the show without the laugh track....you could really enjoy the music....and of course....Day's 70's redition of her big hit Sentimental Journey....don't think she has ever sung better+dvd
Old Rehashed NFL Films Footage.+N+I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible+dvd
Liked the movie - hated the packaging!+P+I'm writing this out of frustration. I saw the ending twice on HBO - Free week-end - liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon. The only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that I have yet to figure out how to open. There is a red plastic piece on the right side. It can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open. I tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked. Those discs are inside for good. I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab. Obviously I'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened. But, as I said before, what I did get to see of the movie, (the last half hour) on hbo . . . I liked. A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today+dvd
A parable about our current relationship to Islam.+P+This is a very entertaining DVD, full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope. In some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current Western civilization of America and Europe and the Islamic world that stretches across Asia. I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs. In this film, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), his father, and the king of Jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs.  The Templar Knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them. In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for Christians. It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design. The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film. Saladin wins the battle and Jerusalem is handed over to the Muslims. Remember that after the death of Jesus, the apostles and disciples spread Christianity into Egypt and Ethiopia, into Rome, France, Spain, England, and Ireland. Also Christianity was spread into Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Germany. Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. Thus the sweep of Islam across the world in around the year 600 brought Islam to Christian communities and cities across the Middle East. It is in response to this growing Islamic power and dominance over the Middle East for 700 years that the Crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film. Yet this is not a Christians hate Muslims who in turn hate Christians type of film. Instead the writers and film-makers imply that the Kingdom of Heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other's beliefs about God. This is actually a good message for our day and time - which director Ridley Scott obviously knows+dvd
Best Waste of a Sunday Afternoon+P+The statement, "He wins a couple of baseball tickets by calling a radio quiz show," misleads the viewer from the best part about this film. He wins Cubs World Series tickets! Therefore, this should be a must see for any Cubs fan!  There is also a cameo by one of the Cubs' greats and, not suprisingly, he has a major impact on the film.  If there is a better movie about a guy breaking out of prison to see the Cubs in the World Series...I haven't seen it+dvd
A brilliant and charming comedy+P+The very funny and very true story of a newly-married couple in New York in the late 1960's.   Barefoot, which made Robert Redford famous, features the lovely Jane Fonda, as well as french actor Charles Boyer.   Extremely funny, very well played, eccentric, original, charming, this is great entertainment+dvd
not as great as "Charlie Parker"+P+Bird, is a film about the life of jazz great Charlie "the Bird" Parker. Forest Whitaker is doing a great job as Charlie Parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life, except one is lead to believe that "Chan" was his wife (in real life, she wasn't). One negative thing I felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film. I think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance. Another critisism is for a film about Charlie Parker, his talent on improvisation, his creativity could have been, and should have been emphasized more. There is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning, Charlie doesn't even remember the piece, or even the conversation that took place. This is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation. In real life, Charlie Parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time, with some additions here and there, givin it a new mood, new angle, new taste. This could have been shown. However, despite these minor shortcomings, I think the film is a very good one. For Charlie Parker fans, I also strongly suggest the book "Bird Lives" by Ross Russell+dvd
Don't Be Fooled!+N+I ordered this DVD for my public library's collection along with the English language version.  THEY ARE THE SAME DISC!  They have the same label numbers.  The only difference is a small paper label on the 'Spanish' version's disc declaring that it's dubbed in Spanish. Both the English and Spanish dubbed discs have the exact same content - soundtracks in both languages.  Shame on Disney/Buena Vista for this horrible marketing ploy+dvd
Not the right actors+N+James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER. That would be my only reason for buying it. He is certainly not in this one! So where is he????!!! Are there no Diner videos or DVDs with James Spader?+dvd
Totally entertaining adventure film+P+This is that typical kind of entertaining 1950s adventure film for all the family, of the kind "they don't make anymore". So if you liked "Elephant Walk" (1954) or "King Solomon's Mines" (1950), this one's most definitely for you!  What stands out, IMO, besides the special effects (good for 1954) and scenes dealing the Marabunta invasion, is the great chemistry between sultry, elegant, appealing Eleanor Parker (Joanna Leiningen), at her prettiest and most ladylike, but at the same time, full of passion, ardour and desire to love a real man...and there he is, Charlton Heston (Leiningen), at the peak of his macho-man magnetism with the ladies (my mother told me that she absolutelly swooned over him around the time he made this film). He conveys very well the character's contradictions between his insecurities as man and his desire for this wondrous woman (Parker), chosen to be his wife by his brother.  The first part of the film has plenty of scenes that fully display, elegantly in 1950s style, the sexual tension between the characters played by both leads. They make one of the handsomest couples ever paired. William Conrad (of "Jake and the Fatman" fame) is good as the friendly comissioner. Abraham Sofaer plays a similar role than in "Elephant Walk", but this time more sympathetic towards the heroine.  Some footage must have been filmed on location, but almost all of the scenes involving the leading players were obviously filmed in Paramount's backlot.  Good entertainment! The DVD has no extras though. The print's quality is very good! +dvd
Good thriller, lousy DVD.+N+Bravo MGM; you've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible DVD. -It's actually an ORION picture, and I'd hoped that they would've cared more about its appearance, but no such luck. Of my 100+ DVDs, this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image. (Let's hope they're more careful with their upcoming Woody Allen ORION collection.) This is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just don't make them anymore in Hollywood, but it's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on TV. Hackman, Heard, Cassidy and Jones lead a good cast, but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie. Until then, avoid like the plague+dvd
Defective Recording+N+This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.  It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!  This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD.  Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing.  And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..  It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording.  Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.  Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash Pirates  This is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.  I am immediately returning this to Amazon.  This recording should never have been released+dvd
Battling Alcoholism, Battling a Disability, and Battling an Incarcerated Outlaw's Determined Friends+P+The three parts of the title of this review illustrate the three main conflicts in this classic western. The main conflict is this: An accused criminal (Burdette) is held in jail on the orders of Sheriff Chance (John Wayne). Burdette's many friends attempt several times to spring Burdette from jail. The setting is Texas sometime after the Alamo, and there is a significant Hispanic flavor in this western.  The following information is provided for those viewers concerned about the levels of violence in films. This western includes a great deal of shooting, and there are actual scenes of people dead and dying of gunshot wounds. In addition, dynamite is used as a weapon.  Dude, an under-sheriff of sorts, had experienced personal tragedies in the recent past, and became a hard-core alcoholic. Burdette's men refer to him with contempt, calling him as a barfly. Throughout this flick, Dude tries to free himself from the bottle. A number of scenes show him trembling from withdrawal symptoms (d. t., delirium tremens). At one point, his hands become so unsteady from the d. t. that he wants to quit his job. In spite of his best efforts, he is about to drink again. But he pours the alcohol back into the bottle, demonstrating at this point both his mastery over alcoholism and the renewed steadiness of his hands, indicative of the passing of his d. t. But the conflict continues. Alcoholism is so insidious. Is Dude actually victorious over his alcoholism, or will he break down and drink again? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.   Stumpy, another under-sheriff of sorts, is assigned to guard the jail. Sheriff Chance does not want Stumpy engaged in gunfights because the latter walks with a limp, and would probably be a liability in a gunfight. But Stumpy resents his subsidiary role, and longs for the action. Will Stumpy remain relegated to the sidelines, or will he see a part of the action? See the film.  Burdette's friends resort to several ploys in order to free Burdette from jail. At one point, they capture Dude and use him as a hostage. They want to exchange him for Burdette. Sheriff Chance, having other ideas, agrees to this exchange. Will Dude be safely returned? And will Burdette go free? Again, I will not spoil the ending by revealing it. +dvd
Film, Acting, Cinematography: Excellent.+P+**I tried to make as little known about plot lines; I will try to be as vague about this film as possible.**  Night of the Hunter is one of those rare films that hasn't won any awards and simply got stored as a film that doesn't seem to get much play on television. Yet, NOH passes the test of time in such formidable ways. The storyline and believability of the plot and characters remains strong, as does the top-notch cinematography.   Film buffs, photography students, and all those who are fans of camera work, please, do yourself a favor; purchase this film, pop some popcorn and then pop the flick in your player, and prepare yourself to be mesmerized by 93 minutes of a film gem. The scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on, and by the time Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) makes her grand entrance towards the end of the film, you'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears, several times over.   How can I impart to film buffs and those who enjoy "eye candy," to please become an owner of this treasure? NOH is rarely spoken of when it comes to must-haves in feature movies. When you see the list of talent, it seems like a quiet film that made its debut in the 1950's, not produced to try for blockbuster status. And people didn't recognize the film then, except perhaps that they didn't embrace its style. It's been over half a century since, and NOH is an opportunity for you to turn off your cellphone and let yourself journey with John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce) as they depend on each other to survive what happens within their family.   By the time Miss Rachel appears, you simply want to cry on her shoulders yourself. Ms. Gish commanded the performance, and seemed to be the only one (along with John) who had any real common sense to understand the unfolding situations.   Fortunately, most of the film seemed to take place in the night, and Stanley Cortez took control of his shots and of the lighting in such extraordinary ways. **slight spoiler info, very slight** One scene worth a note: look past the "spider's web" and the other things during the boat ride; put yourself in the mind of a child, and watch them from that kind of perspective, to understand and appreciate these scenes. At first, I was put off by the perspective of some things, but now, I thoroughly enjoy this passage. **end spoils**  The interesting thing I observed about NOH is that especially now, this kind of unfolding drama could happen in real life. Nothing in it is beyond reasonable. And that's the chilling thought that coursed through my mind after watching it again. Imagine the point of first contact between John and the preacher. The style of filming is so deep-thought. I also found that Cortez was a photographer, and each scene he composed shows that very foundation.   After you watch NOH, place it in an easy-to-get location, because you'll want to watch it again and again. If not for the gorgeously-thought out settings, for perhaps the excellent songs contained within the film.  **Some more spoils, about scenes** My favorites:  John's first knowledge of Harry Powell when telling a story to Pearl Harry Powell with Willa Harper in the bedroom Willa Harper's river scene the complete dark passage on the river  Scene after scene is incredible. You could grab still frames from these and make a beautiful photo album. Someone once wrote that it may have been easier to shoot such scenes with black and white film. Well.... look at the B/W films that have been shot through the decades. Rare are films in which the cinematographer truly displays all of their inner talents. It is simply masterful.+dvd
Beyond Jaynes opening "leg" shot....+N+There's not much this film can offer, unless its some cool-looking British sedans and OK to decent character actors. Quyale is utterly wasted. Jayne is, well, Jayne, and the plot is pretty weak. As far as the picture & sound quality, let's not even go there...+dvd
The Sittaford Mystery+N+I have been an ardent fan of Agatha Christie and Jane Marple for 40 years or more but if this had been the first Christie movie I had seen it would also have been the last.  I had a hard time recognizing any of the story in this movie.  In fact I stopped and reread the book to be sure I was not completely off track.  This is a perfectly good story ruined by overzealous 'modernization' and revision. Geraldine McKewan certainly makes a poor Jane Marple but this is the first one I have seen her in so she might grow on you after a while.  I liked the way the story developed and the way it was solved   but the story line was completely ruined by the movie.  I suppose the movie would have been better if I hadn't been a Jane Marple fan but she was completely extraneous to the story in this one and really didn't appear to contribute to the story at all. I was planning to buy both series of these movies but now I will wait for something else+dvd
Learn (and Retain!) the Letters as a Toddler+P+My daughter (now 2-1/2) started watching this DVD at 19 months.  Within three weeks she not only knew all her upper- and lowercase letters, but she was also obsessed with letters.  We have the foam "puzzle piece" letters that go on the floor - she would pick out her favorite and take it to bed at night or have to carry it to the store.  She watched the video obsessively for a few months until she'd had enough, and now at nearly three she still knows all her letters in spite of not watching the video anymore.  She was similarly enamored with the numbers (Meet the Numbers) and colors (Meet the Colors) and learned each in rapid succession.  We went to the eye doctor several weeks ago, and the nurse was astounded that a two-year-old could actually (and easily) read the letters on the eye chart.  We've now started our 15 month old watching this video.  She is a little young, but has really started talking so she's in the right developmental timeframe.  She has nowhere near the attention span and focus of our older daughter, yet she, too, is mesmerised by this video and is becoming obsessed with letters.  It is truly amazing.  We are giving this DVD as a baby shower gift to everyone we know who is expecting+dvd
Excellent learning tool for introducing your child to the alphabet+P+I love this video because my 3.5 year old learned his letters (both upper and lower-case) in a week.  Sadly, he did not have much exposure to the alphabet prior to this video so we were extremely happy with how quickly he learned.  I thought he would get bored with it because it's very repetitious (eg. the letter 'A' is repeated several times with the image flashing in different positions) but they do use that same letter 'A' as a cute character (a rocket that takes off into the sky while saying 'A') which my child loves.  Each letter (both upper and lower-case) has a different character (although the upper and lower-case of each letter is similar - for example, letter 'A' and 'a' are both rockets in different environments).  The kids voices used for the characters are also endearing to hear over-and-over...which we do watch over-and-over-and-over at my oldest son's request.  (My 18 mo old son loves this video also!+dvd
Memories...+P+If you love the art of dance and this takes you to a blast in the past, then buy this movie for the collection and the history.  The story and acting is pretty bad, but the dancing is excellent!  If you are looking for something with a good story, keep searching.  If you want something entertaining, then this movie is worth it+dvd
Barbi Doll+N+I don't really like video collections.  Live music is so much more interesting.  The only exception I can think of to that rule is the video collection by Tom Petty, because he put out the most imaginative and well produced videos.  I'd much rather see Shania actually singing and relating to an audience than lipping it to these recorded songs.  The only songs on this vid that are live are the last two, and one of them is the boring Rock This Country, one of her weakest songs, a sort of takeoff on Donnie and Marie's I'm A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock and Roll.  It's mostly all glitz and glitter.  It's mostly just seeing the latest outfit and makeup Shania is wearing.  That is superficial.  Let's have a real person instead.  I don't care about the outfits and the makeup.  Seeing her pretend to sing just doesn't cut it.  I've heard these exact versions of the songs plenty of times.  Come On Over is a fantastic album.  She looks great, particularly in her Hawaiian look during the romantic You've Got A Way.  I love that song and I love her Hawaiian look. It's all so romantic.  I'm not wild about her look when she's wearing slacks or sweat pants.  It makes the bottom half of her look so ordinary and boring.  She looks so much better in something feminine.  Sporty Spice is not a turn on and is not romantic.  If you want to turn it up a notch in your music videos, pick up somebody's live performance.  It's a whole different feeling.  Granted, some of them aren't the greatest, but when they are good, they are a lot better than this.  You actually see a real person on stage.  Not just Barbi Doll in her newest outfit and makeup+dvd
Move over James Bond!+P+Great diabolical romp.  Lots of fun to watch,  John Phillip Law at his best! He's the reason this movie is so charming.  Oh, those gorgeous eyes!+dvd
A witty, humane, thoughtful movie directed by Ernst Lubitsch and written by Samson Raphaelson+P+"As Henry Van Cleve's soul passed over The Great Divide, he realized that it was extremely unlikely that his next stop could be Heaven. And so, philosophically, he presented himself where innumerable people had so often told him to go."  Henry (Don Ameche) is greeted courteously by His Excellency (Laird Cregar). "I presume your funeral was satisfactory?" the devil asks. "Well...there was a lot of crying," Henry says, "so I believe everybody had a good time." His Excellency explains that while he will consider Henry's request, there must be good reasons to avoid going Up There. "If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you. Would you be kind enough to mention, for instance, some outstanding crime you've committed " "Crime...crime...I'm afraid I can't think of any," Henry says. "But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor."  Heaven Can Wait is the witty, nostalgic, gentle and surprisingly thoughtful tale of Henry Van Cleve, philanderer, wealthy lay-about and a man far from noble. Under Ernst Lubitsch's direction and with Samson Raphaelson's screenplay, Heaven Can Wait is, as critic Andrew Sarris says, "a hidden masterpiece."  His Excellency is intrigued and asks Henry to tell him his story. Henry believes that he can do this only through the women in his life, and, in one linear flashback, he does, starting as a babe in a bassinet. Henry loves women, he loves the pursuit, he loves the pleasures of the chase, the theater, the champagne, the supper clubs. He's spoiled, he's optimistic, he's endlessly inventive in finding ways out of being discovered. He may be innocently selfish, but it's in an almost childlike way. "Oh, Henry," his wife, Martha (Gene Tierney), says to him after being exasperated once too often, "I know your every move. I know your outraged indignation. I know the poor weeping little boy. I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man, the worn-out lion who is too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night."   Henry had eloped with Martha the day he met her, under the nose of her fiance, his cousin Albert (Allyn Joslyn), a straight-laced lawyer who believes "marriage isn't a series of thrills. Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people." Henry loves Martha deeply, but can't resist a beautiful face or a well-turned leg. Even as a widower, with a grown son, his old habits remain a part of his character. Yet he is so likeable and charming, Henry Van Cleve rarely hurts anyone.   After listening to Henry's story and despite all of Henry's tales of waywardness, His Excellency sends him on his way...but in an elevator going up, not down. He tells Henry, you'll find many people up there who love you and have been waiting for you. They will intercede for you...because despite everything you made people very happy.  This is a delightful movie that must have seemed either a relief or irrelevant to it's time. It was made in 1943 and was popular, yet it ostensibly is about nothing much at all. The setting is the 1870's through the start of the 1940's. There is no reference to any outside forces in Henry's life, no World War I, no Great Depression, no rise of fascism, no moral messages. Yet as the movie goes on we meet characters we come to either find amusing or to like, or both, and they disappear from the screen. Their time has passed and, out of sight, they've died while Henry's story continues. I was left, almost without realizing it, feeling optimistic and a little sad. Life does pass us by, and it's best savored by enjoying life without damaging others.  Among these characters are Henry's grandfather (Charles Coburn), irascible and secretly (and not so secretly) envious of Henry's outlook on life; Henry's father and mother, played by Louis Calhern and Spring Byington, obliviously stern and clueless and loving and clueless, respectively; and Mabel's parents from Kansas, played by Eugene Pallette and Marjorie Main, who have a great Sunday breakfast scene battling over the comic pages while their butler is the intermediary. Laird Cregar, only 29 when he made this movie and dead little more than a year later, brings great, amused authority to the role of His Excellency. Gene Tierney with her overbite was never more luscious. She did a skilled job as Mabel, loving Henry, understanding of his ways but only willing up to a point to be tolerant. The movie, however, is Don Ameche's. He might have been a bland actor, but he is just about perfect as Henry Van Cleve, well-intentioned, charming, constantly tempted and often frustrated.   The movie seems to me to be just about a perfect collaboration between director Lubitsch and writer Raphaelson. They had collaborated earlier on two other great movies, the incomparable Trouble in Paradise and The Shop Around the Corner. Trouble in Paradise has one of the most amusing screenplays you can find, and Lubitsch brought to it all the urbanity and style he was known for. If you could choose only one Lubitsch movie to own, I'd unhesitatingly say to make it Trouble in Paradise. But I think Heaven Can Wait would be second choice.  The Criterion DVD features a sumptuous picture transfer with rich color. The extras include a discussion of the film by movie critics Andrew Sarris and Molly Haskell and an interview with Raphaelson by Bill Moyers. The case has an informative brochure with an essay about Lubitsch and the film.+dvd
Solid entertainment+P+I am glad Best of the Best released on DVD. Even though it is only the 3rd and 4th of the series. The third one is about Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) fights a group of neo-nazi. Best of the Best 4, Tommy is up against Russian mafia who involved in counterfeit. Both movies are quite good for this martial arts action genre. YOu got 2 movies for slightly higher price of a single DVD so it is quite a deal. The picture quality is OK (full screen only) and no 5.1 Dolby Digital, just Dolby 2.0 which is not too bad either. I wish Best of the BEst 1 &amp; 2 will be released soon on DVD. Best of the Best 2 is available on DVD in Canada. For those who can't wait you can find these put up on auctions by Canadians in ebay. I have not received my copy yet so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD+dvd
Children's Classical Ballet+P+The production looked like a "wet fresco" on the wall of an old basilica that has come to life. The  choreography is in close harmony with the musical score.  I enjoyed the meadow dancers, aqua dancers, grafitti wallsters and graffiti tree. But, most of all, I enjoyed the "foot-prep" of Peter, The Grandfather, The Cat, The Bird, The Duck and The Wolf.+dvd
ewhh+N+This movie was just nasty.  A couple of descent parts, but other than that it was just low-class nasty... and I got it for free!!!!  It wasn't even worth it free+dvd
Much Better Than the Lester Film!!!+P+From the first frame the Donner version is much better than Lester's. Everything about Donner's Superman 2 is far superior. This is the way Superman 2 ahould have been. I love the turning back the world ending as opposed to the stupid and I mean stupid forget kiss of the original superman 2+dvd
i love almodovar+P+i can't say it any other way. as one critic once, almodovar doesn't just make movies. he is THE MOVIES! in the light of that, he deserves his own box set. while not a complete box set of his works inclusive, this does feature a pretty good cross section of early works & recent works which confirm that almodovar is indeed a film-making genius in every sense of the word. let me also mention law of desire & matador have never been available in dvd format here in north america prior to the release of this box. it may be a shame, however, for some customers to buy this box set if they already own all the other films in the package aside from those two. on the other hand, this is a great find for many as virtually all of the films here are now very difficult to find & some are currently out of print. fortunately, i only owned bad education & talk to her on dvd before this was released so i didn't lose very much by purchasing the entire box. as far as the plots or storylines go, i think it's fair to say the critics have already done a fantastic job so i will skip the film introductions here. i can also safely assume all of us who are shopping for almodovar films know pretty much what to expect whether it be controversy, heartfelt stories, or madcap humor. if the gods of celluloid cinema would find it in their hearts to release another box set, i would surely appreciate it as there are four more films of almodovar that are either out of print or never released in the states on dvd which would make nice gifts or great collector's items as well. in the meantime, i'm quite sure we are all atleast marginally pleased with the box we've received. the box itself is quite attractive featuring nice artwork all-around, lobby cards including orignal artwork for every film included here, & a bonus disc with special features sure to please every die-hard fan. there are no individual cases for the films here but they are fastened relatively tight by spindles which tend to overlap a bit. i had initally feared that the individual discs could become dislodged in transit causing damage or scratches but everything was in it's proper place. most of the discs themselves don't offer much in the line of extras so they are basically standard issues with the usual subtitles, menu, & chapters. overall the quality of each movie is very good but not great. in fact, some of the discs are only a tad better quality than the old vhs tapes which are hard to find these days as well. but again, i'm just greatful that these films are readily available so the overall picture quality may be jsut small potatoes as far as i'm concerned. nearly all the films here are deserving of the five star rating i've supplied even though i can't say that bad education was my all-time favorite. for some reason or another, i thought this was a bit too dark & i was hoping for a bit more madcap humor or warmth which almodovar is known for. nevertheless, almodovar did an excellent job & gael garcia bernal was phenomenal making bad education a worthy film to view. unfortunately, this one is as unsentimental as it gets. i can hardly wait for the release of his latest film volver on 04/03/07. isn't life grand?         my personal rankings  talk to her all about my mother women on the verge of a nervous breakdown flower of my secret law of desire live flesh matador bad education      +dvd
Season 2+P+Having recently gotten into "The Sopranos," after I finished watching the first season; I rushed to get this. Let me just say, I loved the first season; But I love this more. This is a great season of a great show. Not only are the jokes funnier, the acting stronger, the plot twists more surprising, but they also made a couple good decisions. First off, Livia Soprano (Tony's mom) was a big part of the first season (and frankly, she wore out her welcome several times). Here, her character is decreased and when she does appear...It's not bad. Anyway...Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family, including wife Carmela (Edie Falco), daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and son A.J. return with a whole array of family and business issues. Tony is still seeing Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), his shrink. Christopher (Michael Imperioli) tries acting. Adreanna's (Drea De Matteo) uncle Richie shows up in the beginning of the season, becoming a main character and ends up dating Tony's sister Janice; Despite a personal-and-business feud between them. Oh, and there's a rat in the family. I don't want to say too much, because I think with any show, it's better to watch each episode without any real knowledge of what's going to happen. But, rest assured, if you like the 1st season. You'll definitely like this one. Here's the list of episodes and a few comments:  1. Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office-The first episode of the 2nd season picks up basically where the first one left off. Tony's uncle Junior is in jail, which makes Tony new boss, he's severed ties with his mother, and his psychiatrist won't see him. In this episode his sister Janice shows up.  2. Do Not Resuscitate-Nothing really significant occurs in this episode, but it is pretty entertaining. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. 3. Toodle F**king Oo-This episode is pretty funny, except my interest in Tony's mother in the hospital goes down everytime there's a scene that takes place there. 4. Commendator-In this episode, Tony goes to Italy without Carmela or the kids for business purposes and Pussy's wife wants to divorce him. The episode is written by series creator, David Chase...So, it's one of the better episodes even though it's different from the other ones. 5. Big Girls Don't Cry-This is the most entertaining and cool episode so far and features Christopher joining an acting class and letting out some of his inner demons as well as Tony returning to therapy. 6. The Happy Wanderer-This episode has an array of cool things. Guest appearances by Frank Sinatra Jr. and Robert Patrick; And you hear the song "Down" by Stone Temple Pilots played in the background in one scene. The season is getting a lot better later on, because this is a really great episode. 7. D Girl-This episode is extremely close to perfect. Guest appearances by Jon Favreau, Janeane Garofalo, and Sandra Bernhard. 8. Full Leather Jacket-A surprising (and funny...kinda) ending makes this episode one of the best this season. 9. From Where to Eternity-This episode is written by Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, and deals with what happened in the previous episode. Very dramatic, very funny, and very entertaining. The classic R&B score works really well. 10. Bust Out-In this episode, Carmela comes close to having an affair with a painter. It's an entertaining episode. 11. House Arrest-This episode is very funny and you also get to see a sensitive side to Uncle Junior. 12. The Knight in White Satin Armor-This episode wasn't my favorite, but the last 20 minutes were great. One of the main characters may or may not die in this episode.  13. Funhouse-When an episode of a show is written by it's creator (especially when it's the season finale) it's usually really good. This is one of the strongest episodes.  GRADE: A+dvd
The ultimate battle between good and evil!!!+P+The Transformers have always been a favorite of mine, and to finally be able to own this movie is awesome!!! As a fan I could watch this hundreds of times and still get caught up in the current emotion of the scene. I would give this ten stars, but it only goes to five!! This is a great deal with all of the bonus features!!+dvd
I think Robert Stack wandered in from another movie+N+This is not a "typical" Fuller effort. He goes for the Cinemascope view of post War Japan, pictures of blossoms and Mt Fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer, Robert Stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along -  and his full range of expressions from A to B.  The drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as I imagined Ms Yamaguchi's desire drooped at the thought of giving Mr Stack a massage.  Boy what a let down. Mr Ryan does his professional best but hey, he's always a trooper worth watching.  Mr Godard allegedly thought this was Fuller's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time. No no Nannette?  No no noir+dvd
TERRIBLE..TERRIBLE BORING MOVIE! +N+I am a lover of Japanese movies. I even purchased a masterpiece (Sadakan No. 8) for $50 for a VHS. I have a huge collection of Japanese jems.  So I know what I'm talking about. Heck I'm even Japanese myself :-)   But let me tell you--MABOROSI must mean MAJOR BORING..This movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring. Yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die...please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and Yumiko dreams about this repeatedly. Yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide. She mops throughout the movie from start to finish. She wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect. A totally unrealistic movie; in real life, Yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of. (her husband was some kind of laborer.)   THE MOVIE IS DREADFULLY BORING. BORING. BORING. BORING. It goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot. It goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy...   Masterpiece--HOW ON EARTH????? It's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good.   Now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this. It's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well! I'm not exaggerating.   If you decide to purchase this BORING movie, and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated, well, I warned you.   Thank you+dvd
A Groundbreaking Thriller!!!+P+Jack Nicholson goes crazy better than anyone else on screen.  The film is a bit dated, but enjoyable none the less+dvd
Moon River....this movie is all wet!+N+Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat.+dvd
A waste of time.+N+Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this+dvd
Mindless Black Revenge Drama, Boring+N+Racist cop John Shaft (again the over rated Sam Jackson) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people, blow up the streets of New York and shoot anyone he wants to, well, this movie is a bit of something absurd. The direction is terrible, the action sequences are cliched and the "black brother" message doesn't really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all "honkeys". I would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians.....  +dvd
Old Laughs+P+You may have forgotten just how funny this one is.  It's great for those times when you just want to smile, but aren't sure what to watch.  Plus, you have the added benefit that most young people haven't seen it yet!  Nothing too objectionable in it, so that's good too. +dvd
A Summer Place+P+DVD arrived quickly and it great shape will make a lovely addition to my keepsake collection+dvd
From the mouth of a 5 year-old+P+My son is obsessed with this movie, as he is with everything Scooby.  But he says he give it 4 stars instead of 5 because in this one the gang spends half the movie not being friends (but then they do make up)+dvd
Too many unanswered questions...+N+I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it+dvd
Does not work!+N+The DVD does not work in Ireland so it is absolutely useless!! I should have been made aware of this when I was purchasing the product. I would like to be refunded in full for  the three DVDs I have purchased: My Fair Lady, Paris when it Sizzles and Breakfast at Tiffanys (purchased at the same time) Also the packaging costs were not displayed until i had entered my credit card number and were much too expensive. Overall i am extremely disappointed with my experience and I expect to be compensated for this+dvd
Well shot, terrible ideas+N+First off, I found this movie finely played and edited. But I was truly shocked at Lester's pro-Castro ideology. We're en 1979 for Christ sakes ! Can't we have some true historical facts ? Didn't you hear about the trials, the political prisoners, the crowds of people trying to escape the totalitarian regime ? No, the bad guys here are Batista people, potrayed like mere pigs. I'm glad this movie didn't catch people's attention, it's nothing but propaganda. And like a previous reviewer said, it must be Castro's perefered movie, well done Lester, accomplice of the Castro's killings+dvd
What a stifferoo!+N+Dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed. The only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller. Other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the Alan Smithee psuedonym - what a pity Mr. King didn't. Just awful+dvd
MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE SEEMS STUCK IN REVERSE!+N+Among Stephen King's famous quotes is the one about why he doesn't direct his own films. His answer, not surprisingly, is, "Have you ever seen 'MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE'"? That just about says it all. The film has terrific material to work with, but it is static and very poorly executed. When I watch this film I always think, "Why didn't he do this or that?" and "Why are all the actors just standing around"? Fortunately, King is a better writer than director.  IMPRESSIONS OF A YOUNGER KING FAN:  My teenage daughter has read most of King's novels and agrees with King's assessment of this film. Her favorite film is "Creepshow" which I introduced to her when she was too young and scared her with the famous line, "Where's my cake?" That line still works.  BETTER STEPHEN KING FILMS TO WATCH:  To see better cinematic examples of Stephen King's storywriting, check out "The Shining", "Misery", "Creepshow" or "Carrie". None of these films was directed by King, but each film better represents King's work on the big screen. In "Creepshow" he even stars in one of the sequences "The Death of Jordy Verrill", and he does a respectable job of interpreting his own work.  OUT OF FAIRNESS:  There are worse films out there, but Stephen King did not write the novels or screenplays for them. This film, though not a good representation of King's work, is watchable for some and is not terrible. Unlike many of King's other films, this cannot be classified as good, however+dvd
Charisma is capable of far better acting+N+Drivel.  I'm a 40 year old woman and I like "chick flicks" when they are good. I loved "You've got mail".  But this? This was just drivel. Badly written, formulaic boring plot, and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends.  You want to watch funny interactions between the sexes, watch Friends or BBC's coupling.  You want to watch Charisma ACT? Go rent Buffy and Angel. Watch Veronica Mars.  Charisma did her best to be Mary TYler Moore, but in the end, she was an unbelievable character who I'm supposed to believe as a wallflower. Yeah. Right+dvd
The Foyle Hunk+N+I'd like to give this period tv series higher marks; I love Michael Kitchen's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, and Honeysuckle Weeks as Women's Auxiliary driver "Sam" Stewart is delightful.  Their interplay really makes the show.  It just isn't enough (for me) to compensate for many major shortcomings.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the show weaves contemporary (early WWII) social issues into its plots.  Not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be EXTREMELY off-putting.  Why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area?  Apparently it's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars?!?  Worst of all is Foyle's out-of-character sermonizing, which sometimes takes weird turns, as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he'll be on his case when the war's over.  Not only does this make no sense in view of Foyle's previous instructions, but I interpret the capitalist villain's bemused expression to mean "Thanks for the tip, copper, I'll be getting off THIS flight in extradition-free Ireland!!!"  D'oh!  Well, carry on, inspector!  The show's designers are also a bit careless with PHYSICAL period details.  Usually this is pretty minor stuff, but at least once produces a howler.  In the FIFTY_SHIPS episode, after a lengthy sermon on the CRUCIAL importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of U.S. military equipment ('even though it's just moldy American rubbish'), we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a U.S.-made C-47 (cutting edge in 1940) in RAF colours!!!  As other reviewers have also pointed out, the stories are relentlessly pc.  I have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services; I'm sure that's true of all armies.  But after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman, prejudiced patriot, and cowardly bourgeois I switched to Sherlock!  The unforgivable sin, however, is the cheesy plotting.  It's not just that it's formulaic and predictable, but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow Foyle to 'detect.'  Do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until Foyle pulled a Columbo with the tea bag?  Is there a Gosford Park near this police station?  In conclusion, there're FAR superior Brit and, yes, U.S. detective shows out there.  If you like it pc try Morse; if you're into period try Poirot, Wimsey, or the Hickson Marple.  Leave Foyle unless you're desperate+dvd
salute the king of new york+P+With this concert, he proved he was the King of New York.  For a rapper to sell out Madison Square Garden by himself, as quick as he did, was no real surprise when we all know Jay-Z's achievements over the years. This concert was the culmination of an incredible career.  'The Black Album' delivered what Jay-Z promised, he was back to his very best, and his incredible performance on this DVD showcases that. The live performance is very well mixed in with studio shots of Jay-Z at work with producers working on songs.  It gives the viewer and understanding of what has to happen for a song to be completed, and it also showed Jay's unique way of delivering his rhymes, without any paper, just remembering them and spitting them on the fly. The concert was unbelievable.  Jay-Z trotted out star after star to help him with all his collabo's over the years. The only time this let him down was when he had Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek and Freeway on stage at the same time.  All 3 rappers detracted from Jay-Z being the main show, but this is how i felt on 'The Dynasty' so I guess it wasn't going to change. The night finished with Jay-Z performing Encore and December 4th so a crowd delerious with joy and satisfaction.  After this performance, Jay-Z will go down in rap history as one of the best to ever grace the microphone. Definitely buy this, it's well worth it.+dvd
Lo de menos es el disfraz+N+¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best!+dvd
Awfully Funny+P+After accusing each other of infidelity, Jerry and Lucy impulsively decide to divorce. They have to wait until the divorce is final, but in the meantime each begins to date other people. Lucy dates an oilman from Oklahoma and Jerry has great fun doing everything he can to ruin the romance including telling her how much she'll like Oklahoma's night life compared to New York's.  Lucy gets her revenge by pretending to be his sister when Jerry dates a rich socialite. When they're not trying to sabotage each other's relationships, Jerry and Lucy are fighting over the custody of their dog, Mr. Smith.  "The Awful Truth" is one of the funniest screwball comedies that I've ever seen. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are a delight as the feuding couple who truly deserve each other. There are many laugh out loud scenes in this movie - including when Jerry thinks Lucy is having an affair with her voice teacher and bursts in on what he thinks is the two of them; an off-screen fight between Jerry and said voice teacher; Jerry's date with a nightclub singer, and many many more. There are plenty of double entendres and sight gags to keep you laughing. From the very beginning you know how the movie is going to end, but it's a lot of fun getting to that ending.  "The Awful Truth" is awfully funny.+dvd
BEST BIGFOOT MOVIE TO DATE+P+Even though made as a comedy, this is the best portrayal of Bigfoot Hollywood has ever come up with. Thanks to the very convincing make-up talents of Rick Baker. The master of the trade. I've been waiting for, and requesting this one for years. Family entertainment delight. FINALLY+dvd
What a treat+P+When our adult children were small they loved this film. Now we have an eight year old who is extremely physically handicapped but is mentally alert. He absolutely loves this film. When I hold it up to see if he wants to watch it and he gets the biggest smile. It is a film that children never get tired of and we adults love it too. I had actually forgotten about this movie until I ran across it one day and I immediately ordered it. I am so glad it finally came out on DVD.+dvd
Perfect Truffaut Package.+P+All of the Antoine Doinel films are here in this excellent dvd box set. The films are packaged in their best possible presentation thanks to Criterion, and the special features are all one could ask for including Truffaut's first short film. Not only a great collection of films (THE 400 BLOWS and STOLEN KISSES are among the best) but one of the best titles in the Criterion Collection. A Must own+dvd
the best+P+Man, this DVD is so good. The band is awesome. That's no comment for Chick Corea..+dvd
Could have been better+N+Gay guy tells straight guy that gay guys can get any girl. Straight guy tests this out and supposedly, fiasco occurs. Well there was a fiasco: the acting, the script and the lead actor (guy who plays straight) because he painfully upstaged the rest of the cast. He does a good job in a bad script. The guy that plays his roommate (the straight guy's roommate) is a horrible actor. He made me flinch everytime he delivered his lines. The rest of the cast was 'high school production-esque'--  I especially liked the trampy girlfriend. She kind of reminded me of a non drag version of Devine. I don't remember the names of the characters because most of this movie is forgettable. Some of the scenes were funny when they weren't supposed to be and others were awkward when they were supposed to be funny. There is a little girl (straighty's sister) that also has some funny lines and fairly good delivery. If you want poor production, bad scripts and bad acting, you can either rent America's Funniest Home Videos or this movie. Both have some decent moments, but neither of them are worth buying on DVD+dvd
RAINBOW featurung RONNIE JAMES DIO+P+Who was Rainbow and are they any good? Rainbow was birthed out of famed guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's departure from supergroup DEEP PURPLE.His impression of lead vocalist,Ronnie James Dio's group( ELF who was opening up for DEEP PURPLE), led to his proposition into forming RAINBOW.This group,RAINBOW, established DIO as the premier heavy metal vocalist that would later define metal as we know it.It would prove to be part of DIO's path of successful stepping stones before joining BLACK SABBATH prior to his own highly successful solo career in the 1980's. The 1970's:There wasn't the sound equipment available that we have today nor did the avereage individual have the means to play any form of music videos.So when it was filmed,it was never intended for a professional release.Thankfully,it was filmed and it is great! This is an era that wasn't about all the show,,, IT'S ABOUT THE MUSIC ! It sounds as good as the records did from that era and with an opened mind you will see that this is a true gem to be relished. HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID ! ! +dvd
Velcro. Nice. +P+I really liked this one, an improvement over the first X-men which was also good. There was plenty of stuff exploding, lots of flying, lots of fighting, snappy dialog, with the characters being just developed enough to fulfill their roles without slowing the pace. Patrick Stewart shined as always.   The sound design was not exactly Murch territory but it was basically perfect for an action-blockbuster type of movie, with great balance, and not an over-reliance on dramatic 'over the head' or ping-pong effects.   Now for a couple of small cons: a tiny gripe is Magneto's costume, it was incredibly cheap and dumb looking. They did kind of 'save' this with a line from Pyro, but still...  The most interesting opportunity for any actual drama was the subplot about Striker's son, especially as he controlled the illusory little girl, and then he was just gone. I went back and looked for more shots and they just left that story in the dirt. Really , probably another thirty seconds on the character and I wouldn't even complain given that this was an action flick.  Overall though it was really enjoyable. 'A thrill a minute'. Best line: 'Velcro. Nice.' +dvd
For Jarheads+N+I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..+dvd
Almost Solid Gold+P+To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in "Harvey" and "Arsenic and Old Lace," to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a "dumb blonde"!  She only did that in "Born Yesterday.+dvd
empire of the wolves+N+So whose brilliant idea was it substitute Jean Reno's trademark french accent with a bloody yank's?  What a total let down, the entire appeal of this bloke is his gruff, natural french accent and to trade it off with a yankie accent is beyond comprehension. Idiots.  Ray Duncan Australia.+dvd
great!+P+I'm married to a spanish man and have always wanted to learn the dances from his culture.  Granted, the dances on this dvd are a lot more americanized than the actual thing at times, but i can definitely keep up now.  Each dance is broken down and repeated a lot of times--they teach the men's steps 3 or 4 times, as well as the women's steps, and then both men and women together, then they finally do it quickly to put it all together.  So if you're someone who needs to see it a lot before you get it, this is perfect.  The only funny thing is that the teachers speak with this british-like accent, which i wouldn't expect for a latin theme, but hey it's still great.  The music is even good.  And it's definitely a workout.  This was worth my money, most definitely+dvd
Really Two-and-one-half stars on normal scale, but Dir. Mark Lester screws this one up!+N+Take Eugene Levy (Puhleez!), his former Canadian (R.I.P.)SC-TV alum John Candy and add 'Commando's' Dir., Harold Ramis and (!) James Keach (!!) to the writers and what do you have? An only moderately funny John Candy movie! There are some great bits in here - but this movie is  the greatest waste of space (make that talent!) since Greenland! Robert Loggia and Meg Ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles. And Levy with Ryan?! About  as bad as Billy (Clipper-fan, his only  redeeming quality!) Crystal with Ryan!  Or Tom Hanks! Lester did better here  than with 'Commando',but is that really  saying much!?+dvd
i would do business with this again+P+came in good time and i a1 conditio+dvd
David Attenborough is unbelievable+P+This is a disc that contains six movies on it, each with a theme that revolves around one season in the Antarctic and what happens during that time to the continent and the animals and birds that live in or on it.   These movies are so realistically and clearly presented that you need a blanket to curl up in while watching Attenborough walk around in freezing Antarctica filming all kinds of creatures - on land, under water and in the air. The guy (and his camera team) are simply unbelievable.   They spent three years filming these scenes. As anyone who has experienced anything colder than freezing can attest to, spending even a few minutes outside on a cold day can be daunting. But to spend all your time in temperatures of 74 below, with winds of upto 120 miles per hour - that is either sheer determination or insanity, or maybe a mix of both.  Whatever, the result is startling movies that are breathtaking, superbly shot, and extremely well-presented. I have watched most of Attenborough's films and they are all top-notch. He is definitely the world's most amazing wildlife and nature filmmaker ever. He presents everything as is, without sentimentality, but with a clear sense of wonder at all the marvels he is depicting. When he speaks and shows you scenes, you feel you are there.   Hands down one of the top three wildlife films I have ever seen. Highly recommended+dvd
Completely Awesome!+P+The Golden Suns are here, finally! This is an amazing set, and better than I remembered it as a kid!  Compelling stories, good animation, great voice acting.  Tons of fun for any age.  Wish they made cartoons today as good as they did back in the "day".  The Temple of the Golden Suns completely got me hooked on Duck Tales as a kid, and got me into reading the Carl Barks/Don Rosa comic books.  I remembered it from, gosh, when I saw it in 87', so it must have made a big impression!  Go get it today - you won't be disappointed!  Because life IS like a hurricane+dvd
I Can't believe we missed this show the first time around!+P+This show has it all, I can only hope this continues fall the remaining seasons.  I  never thought it was this deep, how entertaining can a show about a high school student killing vampires be?  Damn Entertaining, that is what!+dvd
Quite the little head trip.+P+Swimming Pool explores some very interesting themes: the differences between youth and age, innocence, sexual awakening, motherhood, solitude, and voyeurism, among others.  The plot is deceivingly simple. Sarah, a writer, is staying at her editor's house in France so she can work on her next novel. She's had a great deal of success as a mystery writer, but seems to have hit a wall. She doesn't want to do another mystery, but she doesn't know what else to write about.  Enter Julie, the editor's daughter. She breezes into the house one night like a force of nature. Her first order of business? She uncovers the swimming pool in the backyard. It's full of leaves, but this doesn't stop her from peeling her clothes off and swimming in it. She also takes to sunbathing topless and having sex in the living room on a nightly basis, with whatever men she can talk into coming home with her.  Sarah is disgusted by all of this behavior at first, but as time goes by, she becomes captivated by it. She creates a 'Julie' file on her computer, and she starts writing again.  But there's a lot more going on under the surface. What is fantasy? What is reality? Is the movie just a product of Sarah's imagination? Are Sarah and Julie linked in some way, and if so, how? What the hell is going on?  Francois Orzon, in an interview with Indie Wire, had this to say:  "I don't want to give you the key. I myself have an opinion about it, obviously -- but I wanted to keep the film open-ended and let every viewer imagine what he wishes. It's a movie that gives viewers the freedom to make their own film."  So essentially the meaning of the movie is left for you to decipher. I'm not sure how I feel about that. It doesn't really seem like good storytelling, and it would be disastrous if every director in the world started doing this. But Orzon isn't every director, and Swimming Pool isn't an ordinary movie. I found myself thinking about it a lot once I had ejected the DVD, turning the facts over in my mind and trying to make them fit into some kind of coherent storyline. It's strangely satisfying to do this, and I seriously suggest that you watch the film so you can do the same.  My only complaint is that the DVD features were sparse - just a trailer and a few deleted scenes that didn't seem to add much. There wasn't any director's commentary, which irked me to no end. I would have loved to hear Orzon's take on the rather bizarre series of events, but no such luck.  Oh, and should you pick up the unrated version, be prepared for a lot of Ludivine Sagnier's breasts. They should have been given second billing for all their screen time+dvd
I haven't recieved this item yet+N+I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive+dvd
4 not a 5+P+This film looked and sounded great. It was an Angelina Jolie movie but it just wasn't what I expected. I come from the time were Lara Croft was controlled by your fingure tips so I don't think they captured my Lara Croft Tomb Raider. It is still a film I have seen in standard and own in HD. The HD looks great. The film itself just didn't do it for me. They really didn't capture the essence of Tomb Raider+dvd
Strangely sterile, a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity.+N+This is a movie that got universally bad reviews.  It helped knowing that going in because my expectations were very low.  Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I was not disappointed in her performance.  Despite a thin plot and cheesy effects, Angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse.  Unfortunately even her talent cannot overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations.  The film grew tiresome very quickly.  On a Jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility.  The first scene is Lara upside down, in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler.  This opening segment defined the problem for the film--someone who is not grounded and unconscious.  Lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose--except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else.  This cycle repeats endlessly, as do video games, which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none, sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain.  The individual does not develop--just the skills.  Lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs, co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game.  This disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight.    In one moment in the movie, there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle--Lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father.  But then she reverts to form.  In addition there is no mention of her mother--what happened to her and why is this not a loss? Obviously this is such a deficit it cannot be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed, and by the total lack of other women in the film.   Overall a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity+dvd
No, SendThem Sand; No, You Can't Take It With You!+N+Very disappointed.  The famous routines I was looking for are not on this set.  I didn't like these routines. Look for mine on Ebay cheap+dvd
Best seen with low expectations+N+A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.  With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show cliché) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.  A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself+dvd
The Life of Tito+P+The biography of Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito could have been presented in many different ways, taking into account different literary portrayals of this truly great statesman of the 20th century.  There is no doubt that Tito had a multitude of enemies, but the number of his friends was even greater.  I was a child when Tito died, but I witnessed the truly heartwrenching outpour of grief among common people of Yugoslavia - from Slovenia in the Northwest, to Macedonia in the Southeast (or as a Yugoslavian song says, From Vardar to Triglav, From Djerdap to the Adriatic).  I will never forget that stunning sight.  It is that much more sad that Tito has been much maligned by the radical nationalists, and even more sad that the common people who once cried for him now rejected the memory of him.  Tito is often portrayed as a communist - there is no doubt that he was the leader of the Yugoslavian communist party.  But above all, Tito was a nationalist, fighting for the southern Slav peoples of the Balkan peninsula.  Not many Westerners know that Tito never allowed Stalin to absorb Yugoslavia into his Eastern Bloc, or Warsaw Pact.  Tito, along with Nehru and Nasser, was the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement.  The world, not just Yugoslavia, lost a great man on May 4th, 1980 at 3:05pm, when Tito succumbed to illness in a hospital in Ljubljana, Slovenia, just short of his 88th birthday.  The world needs more leaders like him, leaders who truly strive to unite and spread peace.  So, indeed, may he rest in peace+dvd
Boring+N+This video was very boring compared to the "Elmo's World" videos that my son loves. I guess if you are looking for something low key and relaxing for a baby to watch it is a good choice. It is not good for a baby who really loves fun music and action.  My son was 10 months old when I played it and he wasn't interested at all and neither was I. The song choices were dissapointing. It was tedious to sit through, but luckily at only 30 minutes long it was almost over before it started+dvd
Unexpected Great Find+P+All of us over 40 types looking for a trip down memory lane with the likes of Supercar (Mike Mercury) and Fireball XL5 (Steve Zodiac) can take a more engaging trip with Captain Scarlet, which didn't air in the U.S.  It's like discovering a lost and forgotten series.  UFO fans will recognize the voice of Captain Blue as Ed Bishop.  It's also somewhat uncanny that a show written 40 years ago about the Mysterons "war of nerves" against mankind is not unlike the present-day threat of terrorism.  Unlike Supercar and XL5, people do die in this series, so small children might be disturbed.  Personally, I think this is the best series that Anderson ever did (sorry Thunderbirds fans)+dvd
So Stupid, It's Funny+N+I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it.+dvd
Melinda + Melinda = Boring+N+Melinda and Melinda is a concept film. And a good concept at that. Basically, two writers are having dinner with some friends and discussing whether life is comic or tragic. A friend begins to tell a story and each writer gives their perspective on how to make it a tragic or a comic tale. So begins our two movies within the movie.  With the director, and such a great cast, you'd think this film would easily be bound for greatness. On the contrary, you're bound for boredom. The biggest problem with the movie is the casting of Radha Mitchell as Melinda, the only character that is involved in both stories. Her acting is stilted and she stumbles along taking scene after scene down with her. Another fault is the fact that none of the other actors are in both stories. Melinda and Melinda would have been a much more interesting film (both for the audience and for the actors) if the entire cast would have been involved in both sides of the story.   As it is, the story switches back and forth between the two at a confusing pace, and doesn't apologize for moving slowly and drudgingly along. Will Ferrell offers the only breath of fresh air in this film as a married man who falls in love with Melinda and can't tell her.   Overall, this movie is quite slow and although there are moments of clarity and even brilliance, you will find yourself wishing to fast forward til something intersting happens... and if you do so, you may find you've missed the whole movie+dvd
It just never gathers steam.+N+Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter.  In fact it was a little boring.  Plus, what language are these folks speaking?  I know it's English, but it might as well be French.  The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable.    Not much to like here.  Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple+dvd
Banal Binoche extravaganza+N+This film began as a beautiful European historical period piece, in Paris, which lush costumes, gorgeous people, etc. But after an hour, it deteriorated into incredibly boring melodrama with Binoche placed in alternating picturesque European cities and sex scenes. No deep emotions are penetrated, more than many other Binoche vehicles like "Chocolat" and "The Horseman on the Roof". I couldn't wait for it to end -- it's 2 hours seemed like 4+dvd
Not historically accurate, but gripping and moving nonetheless...+P+In 1955, playwrites Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee published their play, Inherit the Wind, in response to the anti-Communist lynch-mob mentality of the post-WWII/Korea era.  Based in part on the historical events of the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, Lawrence and Lee delved into the questions of tryanny by the majority and mob rule through the dramatization of the week-long "circus" surrounding the trial.  The subsequent faithful screen adaptation of the story in 1960 employed not only the explosive dialogues and confrontations of hypocracy of the play but also employed the magnificent performances of acting legends Spencer Tracy and Fredric March.  Portraying, respectively, rumpled and disheveled defense attorney Henry Drummond (Clarence Darrow in the real-life trial) and the religious populist and volunteer prosecutor Matthew Harrison Brady (William Jennings Bryan), this film adaptation grips the imagination and leaves viewers emotionally and physically grasped by the courtroom proceedings and by the various confrontations between the old world that was and the new world that was coming.  This film is as compelling today and perhaps moreso than it was when it was first released.  Anyone wanting to enjoy two bravura performances of two of America's truly great actors is encouraged to set aside a couple of well-spent hours to watch and experience this film+dvd
Authentic and a great depiction of occurances in the Afganistan war+P+I am going to keep this short and sweet I really Liked this movie and have watched it several times. I only have one complaint, I wish it were offered in Russion with subtitles. It appears to much like they are  Americans, no accents+dvd
Battle of the Bulge+P+I am very interested in WWII movies and find this one to be one of the best out+dvd
A HIGHSIERRABASSPLAYER FIVE-STAR RATING!+P+The difference between the reviewers loping off a star and those giving this DVD a five-star is obvious - the lopers are people that don't play! This DVD (three actually) is an excellent production in sound and video quality as well as performance. The supporting bands are excellent as well. Hey, we're all aging, even you three and four star critics. It is indeed rare to get blues and jazz from these masters in the first place, and all the live performances will preserve our blues and jazz heritage. If you love the blues and jazz, this DVD is pure and simply excellent.+dvd
not very useful+N+I felt the author was showing off his skills but not teaching much. Other than the very basics, you will not learn much about rythms and technique from this DVD.+dvd
What is Disney Thinking?+N+I share the dismay of other reviewers about the unconscionable decision on Disney's part to release, in 2005, the wonderful Hayley Mills movies in fullscreen format instead of in their original aspect ratio, and in slapdash form in general.  I have eagerly awaited the DVD release of this film, The Moonspinners and That Darn Cat, and am bitterly disappointed.  What a waste!  I encourage all fans of these films to visit http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/ and complain to them directly, as I have+dvd
Beautifully filmed noir piece+P+I really like this film.  First of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at.  Tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed.  The story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children.  Intense, often suspensful and sometimes creepy, this is a keeper.  Swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve.  SHe is amazing to watch.  The rest of the cast is fine their roles, whether shady, clueless or sympathetic.  Well worth a view+dvd
Unworthy Sequel+N+In 1978, when film critic Roger Ebert interviewed Irwin Allen, the mega-producer suggested a potential story idea for a planned sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure"...The survivors of the Poseidon disaster would be rescued and taken to land in Italy where they would be placed on a train which would go through a tunnel in the Alps. The tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain. Ebert thought it was an excellent idea. And as it turns out Mr. Allen should have went with it. Because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time; ranks among the worst sequels ever made; and marked the beginning of the end of Allen's reign as the "Master of Disaster." Side note: Allen directed this mess and, as "Beyond TPA" star Michael Caine said in his autobiography, good ol' Irwin should have stuck to producing!

Not to be missed+P+If you have not seen this little gem based on E.M Forster's first published novel then you are in for a treat. An excellent story adapted to fit the screen perfectly with sublime performances from Rupert Graves and  Judy Davis. A very fine series of moments. Go ahead treat yourself to a bit  of class+dvd
One of the worst movies ever made!!!!+N+This movie is very gross. This movie is horrible. The movie is a disgrace to the movie industry. I am so glad that I had got this cheap. I will be getting rid of it. It would be an insult to my dvd collection for me to keep this video.   This movie is a waste of everything used to make this movie. It was also a big waste of my time.  "Howard the Duck" was better than this.  This movie was just flat out horrible.!!!!  I used to collect GPK stickers  I thought they were cool. To see this movie I am just apalled I didn't know there was a movie out there so horrible.+dvd
Poor+N+Mediocre acting and predictable plot. Very disapointing. Not inspired at all+dvd
#25: ANOTHER EXCELLENT ZATOICHI EPISODE+P+The 25th episode of Zatoichi finds the ever humble blind masseur on his way to his hometown. It has been years since Zatoichi has visited his family; and with a toss of a coin, the protagonist finds himself back to a different village that he left many years before. One of the changes Zatoichi finds is that he has a sister who was raised by the same woman who raised him. Only the old woman is now deceased: Zatoichi has been away far too long.  Also, Zatoichi meets a man who grew up with him as a young boy. This man is now a corrupt government official. When Zatoichi is giving this friend a massage, the official says that he does not know Zatoichi, yet ichi knows that the official is lying. Ichi relates what they did as children, and still the official rebuffs him. The official is not only corrupt, but he has no honor and decency. The official is attempting to claim the village's quarry, which is the main source of income for the people who live there. And this angers Zatoichi.  One of the greatest actors in cinema history also makes his appearance in the film. Takashi Shimura--of the famed "SEVEN SAMURAI" and "IKIRU" by Akira Kurosawa, portrays the old man who is watching over the new-found sister of Zatoichi. Takeshi Shimura has always been my favorite actor, and it was wonderful to see him in this episode of Zatoichi. The conclusion of the film is a strange one, which I do not wish to give away. However, Zatoichi confronts his old childhood friend. And as he does he struggles with the problem of whether or not to kill him. This is an excellent Zatoichi episode. The cinematography is great, and the character actors in the film--especially the corrupt official--are great. I highly recommend this great episode of "Zatocihi's Conspiracy" to all viewers.+dvd
A fine Jimmy Stewart western+P+The American frontier shifts north to Alaska in this tightly paced Anthony Mann western, starring Jimmy Stewart as a hard-bitten, cynical cowboy loner who finds himself caught up in the Klondike gold rush, and with it, the struggle between lawless injustice and the budding new civility.  Walter Brennan gets a choice role as Stewart's stammering, old-timer sidekick; John McIntyre is delicious as the unrepentant villain, Judge Gannon of the border town called Skagway, who runs the place as his own personal company town.  Stewart plays his antihero to the hilt, and the on-location cinematography is impressive... A nice, taut, enjoyable film+dvd
about the movie Passenger 57.......+P+This is one of the good movie/film from Westley Snipes's series which I could say is a good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film.

Deconstructing Annie Hall -- One of Woody Allen's Least Memorable Films +N+`Anything Else' reminds me of Woody Allen's earlier masterpiece `Annie Hall' in more than one way - a love romance in New York City, an aspiring comic writer, funny one-liners, jazz songs, and most of all, the choice of the hero/heroine who might or might not leave the city. The difference is that `Anything Else' doesn't achieve the level of humor and pathos of `Annie Hall.' Perhaps the film's soulless touch might reflect Allen's own feelings about the city and filmmaking itself these days, and also explain this strangely weariness of the film that is very disappointing.  Jason Biggs plays Allen's alter ego, young comedy writer Jerry who really wants to write a serious novel. He struggles to make his dream come true for all this incompetent agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) and his frigid girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci) who refuses to sleep with him (for six months). Perhaps some viewers would find these characters unlikely or worse, unlikable - and Jerry and Amanda are all living in a nice, clean room together in New York City, and afford to hear Diane Krall singing and stay in a hotel (single room, $200) - well while we are watching these annoying and implausible characters, another irritating person arrives. It is Amanda's mom Paula (Stockard Channing), who 'tries' something new (here white powder) ... like in 'Annie Hall.'  This formula of vintage Woody Allen comedy with eccentric characters might have worked in the 70s and 80s. Actually, there are some funny jokes from Allen himself, playing Jerry's mentor David Dobel, but the film itself, especially the first part, is slow and boring. Fast and snappy dialogues are not to be found, and the character of Ricci, who fails to show the charm of a real coquette, is only irritating.  Actually, the casting itself is the real problem. Jason Biggs is not convincing as struggling Jewish writer, and neither is Ricci as whimsical heroine. I know it is too much to expect from them the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton, and what is more embarrassing is that Ricci is seen prowling in her underwear, as if compensate the lack of that credibility of romance.  `Anything Else' is definitely not meant for those who are going to watch Woody Allen films for the first time - in that case, he or she would never come back again -- nor for his devoted fans, who prefer his films with romance, humor, wit, and insightful observation about life. It took nearly three years for the film to be released in Japan where I watched it, and now I know the reason for the delayed release+dvd
Lover's Lane......another horrible wannabe slasher movie to add to the pile+N+Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the "Hook Man" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous+dvd
More of the good old Jeeves humor+P+If you liked the original ones, get them all.  These are just as enjoyable+dvd
The World's Greatest Dance Show+P+All I can say is that if there is anyone who doesn't love this show after seeing it than we don't live on the same planet. This show inspired me to take Irish dancing. Now I've worked my way up to going to the world championships next year! In other words, it's a masterpeice. Personally I would give this 10 stars. There just is no comparison+dvd
Slapstick & boring+N+Too slapstick, silly & boring.  I couldn't suffer through the first episode of this one+dvd
A Must See Movie+P+Ioan Gruffud IS Horatio Hornblower, to a fault-even as a lean, mean sea captain. His shocking good looks make him an instant HIT. But blimey! He marries his landlady's daughter Maria? I half expected the bloke to marry a demure lovely Keira Knightley type. His ladylove is at least 8 years his senior, and perhaps this explains his desperation to return to the briny deep! Besides Ioan, another hero in this movie is GREG WISE-- as a French turncoat his acting was STUPENDOUS. Good job Greg+dvd
saljac+P+Finally, a sophisticated adult movie without the mindless violence and language prevailent in most current movies. The interplay between the main characters is a joy, and, accompanied with a sharp dialogue. I wish they would make more movies like this. If you like this movie, checkout "Roughcut".   +dvd
Bad hair day Mel? +N+I chose this film thinking it would be Mel Gibson when he was still good. Yes, he was good, but I'd seen it many years ago, when I was still at school, and didn't remember. Until I was watching the film and thinking that I'd already seen this before. I had an inkling that I'd already seen it, when the girl jumped off the building (I think I had a moan about why she had to be almost topless the first time round) and then Mel gets out of bed. I definitely remember that scene! Damn.   The thing about watching Lethal Weapon now, is that it's been either spoofed too many times or it's been copied so many times. Almost every 80s cop movie is like this. Good cop, bad cop. Neither wants a partner. Then they realise they can't work without each other. And it spawns some mediocre sequels. In the case of the spoofing, see Loaded Weapon, with Emilio Estevez and Samuel L Jackson.  There was nothing particularly stand out about this film - apart from Mel's hair, which was just awful - I liked the pairing of Mel & Danny, and I liked the albino Gary Busey, playing a bad guy, who doesn't even flinch at his arm getting burnt with a lighter. Ouch. The guy about to commit suicide from the top of the building and then having Mel's character handcuffed to him was the stand out scene for me, not including the opening scene.  The reason I'm only giving this 2 stars (which isn't going to go down to well with some reviewers) is because if I'd seen it when it originally came out, I probably could have given a higher rating. But we've seen it all before these days, and yes, it may have been a brilliant movie then, but not so much for me.   For me, I would like to see another sequel to this. Maybe Mel could grow his hair again? I mean, there is another Indiana Jones on the way, and another Die Hard. Lets revive Lethal Weapon shall we? You're never too old, as Harrison Ford is proving and Mel and Danny are both younger. They could still do it. Couldn't they? Maybe Mel could save his reputation.   Most reviewers consider this a classic, but in my case, it was worthy of a watch, but I don't remember being that impressed by it the first time round. (So much so that I didn't realise I'd already seen it!) If you saw it the first time, relive the happy memories, and watch it on HD, cos it amazing. (Bearing in mind I did see it on VIDEO, so anything is better than that.+dvd
Truth?+N+If you would like some factual information underlying the glitz and glamour portayed in this video, please contact an organization on comercial sexual exploitation. We can tell you about the whipping with coat hangers combined with salt water baths, or curling iron burns all over the body followed by hot curling irons (...). Sound glamorous? All because you didnt finish up your whole box of condoms. If you believe these con-artists (gamers), you are very naive. Dont be ignorant, get the facts. But be prepared to deal with changing your views about the women involved in this lifestyle when you do. The only good thing artistically these films do is to evoke dynamic discussion on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And no, legalizing it wont make it go away+dvd
This movies looks awesome on blu-ray!!!+P+Superman Returns is a must have if you just recently bought a blu-ray player.  I heard many negative comments about blu-ray as compared to hddvd before I bought my PS3.  I still have not seen an hddvd so I am not going to say anything negative about it, but as far as blu-ray every movie I have seen has blown me away.  Not only is the picture amazing, but the sound on my surround system is also much better.  Like I said this movie looks particularly awesome.  I also recommend Invincible on blu-ray+dvd
One of the better sequils!+P+This is actually a well plotted, scary horror film. The opening credits of children singing while a camera roles through a dark corn field tells you that your in for a treat. It starts out when a group of foster parents are found badly decayed in a celler. Now, the cult of evil children are up for addoption! With satanic plans on there minds, they must be stopped soon before another massacre of adults befalls the isollated town. When elders who know of the evil inside the children speak up the children go on a mission to convert any new child in the area, and kill any adults who get in their path. Can a boy and his father stop them before they reach their goal? Featuring great effects and scary suspence.+dvd
Hot and Greasy, but well worth it.+P+I saw this documentary last weekend at the River Run Film Festival in Winston Salem and it was a smash hit.  George Motz did a superb job of uncovering one of our most treasured cultural icons in an entertaining and hillarious way, and that is saying a lot coming from a vegetarian.  This guy has definitely got a great career ahead of him+dvd
Some little gnostic ideas with lots of unpleasant music!+N+Well, I must say that the DVD has many aspects:  1. Most of the music is absolutely annoying and horrible for a topic such as gnosticism. Furthermore, the volume of the music itself sometimes does not allow us to listen clearly to the words of the narrator.  2. Everything in reduced to this: GNOSIS is an alectromagnetic experience with the quantum universe that lies within the self. Hence, to be illuminated by Christ or to be a Buddha is just to achieve an electromagnetic condition offered by the union with the Universal Mind and the kundalini in us.  3. The narratror fails to expose a very important and key idea: there are TWO types of kundalini and two main centers in the human body. He never speaks of the Kundalini of the Heart. He speaks only of the lower kindalini, the one responsible for the human sexuality.  4. Anyway, it is worth to watch the DVD once. But be prepare to endure a very disgusting and annoying music that hides the most important thing: the words of the narrator! Too much especualtion, at the end.  It is sad that there is not yet in the market a good DVD on GNOSIS or Gnosticism, made with ellegance, fair scientifical research and seriousness, without any music at all as the background.  This DVD is an excellent example of how annoying can music be!+dvd
Shallow characters, bizarre story+N+That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!  On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it+dvd
Pretty Lame+N+I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash+dvd

HELP! Clarification needed+N+About half the reviewers here claim that these are *not* the original versions of the films. The rest claim that the "original versions" in this set are, in fact, the original versions. Some reviewers claim that the sound is only Dolby Digital, while the box pictured above has THX right on it. What gives? Which is it?  Next poster, please address this. Thanks+dvd
"Are You A Fish? Are You A Man? Are you Melkur?"  ~  Beware Taxicab Drivers With Boney Sticks+P+David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a well respected lawyer and family man living and practicing in Sydney, Australia. Of Occidental origin and Anglican faith, David has never been one overly concerned with the intangible, unexplainable mysteries of life. However his predictable, concrete world has recently been disrupted by a series of vivid and disturbing dreams that have called into question the very nature of reality. Unable to sleep for fear of more night visions he buries himself in his work.     His Stepfather, Reverend Burton (Frederick Parslow), notices the change in David's demeanor during a weekend visit with the family and questions his Stepson on the matter. David confides in him with the statement, "I'm having bad dreams." As a conversation ensues David is reminded of a series of repetitive nightmares he had as a child. He would awaken in the morning to tell his parents that taxicab drivers came to him in dreams and took him on long drives during the night. That's why he was always tired in the morning.  Despite the ongoing dreams and a serious lack of sleep life must go on. He is assigned his first homicide case, he is to defend a group of aborigines in what appears to be a tribal ritual murder. The night before he is to meet his new clients he is visited by a young aborigine in another vivid dream. The unidentified man is holding a triangular rock containing some cryptic carvings and symbols. He stretches out his arm towards David as though offering him the stone.  This dream unexpectedly and dramatically takes human form the next day when he meets Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), one of the murder suspects. Chris just happens to be the aborigine in his dream. David invites the young man to his home for dinner in an attempt to discover the truth not only about the murder case, but the meaning of dreams. When Chris arrives for dinner that evening he is not alone. He has brought Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula), an aborginal "clever man" or shaman (who earns a living in the city as a taxicab driver).  Thus is the beginning of a journey into a reality that Western Civilization has all but forgotten about. This is the "The Dreamtime" a separate but equally valid stream of consciousness existing alongside our waking world. David is soon to discover that his dreams are inexplicably connected to this archaic world and he is about to play an important role in either the continuation or destruction of both worlds.  In my estimation this is without question director Peter Weirs' signature film. He has captured on film something I wouldn't have thought possible, giving us a brief but illuminating firsthand glimpse into the very heart of aboriginal shamanism. The conversation concerning the 'nature of dreams' between David, Chris and Charlie is one of the most fascinating and mesmerizing mystical moments in cinematic history.   Richard Chamberlain is perfect in the role of David Burton. His ability to express his inner turmoil and fear of the unknown with the absolute minimal amount of dialogue or gesture attests to just how accomplished an actor he is. David Gulpilil (Walkabout, Crocodile Dundee & Rabbit-Proof Fence) is also the undisputed best choice for the part of Chris, providing a most striking contrast with Richard Chamberlain in both worldview and physical appearance.  However the real star of the film is Nandjiwarra Amagula. This of course is the ultimate in typecasting because Nandjiwarra is in fact an authentic aboriginal shaman. Truly a man of immense spiritual and physical magnetism, his mere presence on camera is capable of evoking the Dreamtime experience. If you have ever had the desire to pursue the shamanic path look deeply into the countenance of Nandjiwarra before you decide. Those eyes will tell you everything you need to know+dvd
Subtitles cut off+N+If you speak french this dvd is probably fine - but for me there are better dvd's that focus on a dancer's life in a ballet company. The subtitles were cut off at the bottom and on the sides so you either looked at the dvd without knowing what was being said or you struggled to figure out the subtitles since they were only partially shown.+dvd
The Movie Is Just As Bad AsThe Book+N+I'm looking at reviews and people are saying, "The movie is awful! Read the book."  It's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see, butI advise you NOT to read the book. It's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache. If you're in school and you're required to read this book, I suggest you just watch the movie (get the 2 hours and 52 minutes out the way) and  get Cliff Notes. For real, don't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice+dvd
I Spit On Your Shoe+P+I spit on your grave is a fun film for fans of Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" and other "Rape/Revenge" classics, There are some elements of this film that are genuinely gruesome, and others that are practically laughable, either way, it's not a bad way to spend 100 minutes of your life, not if your like me anyway. Joe Bob Brigg's commentary on this film is a great treat for anyone who has heard about this picture because of it's controversy, because he does a great job of explaining all of that, and also if your just a big movie buff and want to hear interesting facts about the movie, because that track is chock full of info that is a great addition and Joe bob is pretty entertaining anyway, Meir Zarchi also has a commentary track on this DVD witch is interesting because i had heard that he had kept pretty quiet about this picture since making it, but frankly i was ready to fall asleep about 40 seconds into his track so i can't really say i found it that interesting, all in all "I spit on your grave" is a fun midnight movie for hardcore buffs, and curious horror fans alike+dvd
only pricks like this film+N+This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!+dvd
Jazz Messengers Live in '58+P+A stunning discovery in Belgian archives of a concert in Brussels in 1958 with the famous line-up with Benny Golson (tenor) and Lee Morgan (trumpet) that lasted only 6 months. Benny Golson's now famous compositions like 'I Remember Clifford' and Whisper Not' are still fresh, and it is incredible to actually see 20-years old Lee Morgan and hear how mature his playing was. The only visual document of a live performance of a legendary group. And excellent quality+dvd
Long and tedious, although realistic+N+The movie tracks Mr. Lazarescu on his last night as he travels in and out of emergency rooms in search of assistance.  The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long.  Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life.  The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about.  The editorial comment that one can visualize how "suffocatingly slow time must seem" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that "suffocatingly slow" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out+dvd
Good, Cheesy Fun+P+First of all, this review is based on the original (subtitled) version, not this Disney-edited DVD.  Don't watch this movie expecting something of the caliber of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; you'll be disappointed.  An obvious take-off of stories like The Three Musketeers and with a mood similar to the Batman movies, this film is often confusing and melodramatic, at times simply absurd.  That said, the acting is decent and the fight scenes engaging, making for an enjoyable film.  It's entertaining, if not earth-moving+dvd
or 1???+P+It m a y depend on your mood. If u r a highbrow critic and only embrace "La Strada", Bergman, Fellini, Minnelli, "Cabaret" and so forth u may be the 1 giving this film only 1 point...  But IF u have a sense of humour, satire and respect for ageing superstars NOT past their prime - this is the 1 for u...  Naturally, Miss Mae delivers her most famous lines and there are moments of embarresment - but on the whole - she still is magnetic and of amazing vitality being at the age of 86....  The supporting cast is god(Dom DeLuise a REAL TREAT) but so is Timothy, Ringo and Tony...  Yup, the musical sequences are below average, but as I pointed out, is done with an awareness of humour...  Many a spectator would wish Mae West had`n done this, but I must say, she does NOT come badly out of it...+dvd
Bad Horror = Mimic 2+N+This movie takes the cool concepts of Mimic, and then abuses, burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us.  This movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer.  if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy+dvd
yin in the yang+P+If you don't like this, perhaps you are a bibliophobe? Or "reality-shy"...(or a jingoist; i'm not describing a certain group of people, am i?)  Watch it already. My stupid unnecessary criticisms: Since they couldn't acheive realistic skinniness, they should of had an amazon traipse through; the planes should have been models for the "handmade" effect.

Character and Honor+P+Top notch acting through a difficult subject.  The loss of hope through capture, torture and betrayal in the face of brutal circumstances is the crucible in which true honor and self sacrifice rise to the surface.  This prisoner of war movie, slated to release too close to 9/11, finally reached the public without fan fare and is one of the most powerful depictions of honor and true humility available today.    When some of the prisoners are inspired to teach and study and redeem the time by sharing their gifts and talents, hope finds its way into the hearts of the prisoners once again.  They now have something to live for, to look forward to at the end of the work day, and their "awakening" causes their captors to permit expansion (espeacially since their productivity increases).  Ultimately, their honorable ways are admired (even if privately) by their enemies, who lack the compassion necessary to be truly honorable themselves+dvd
Wonderful.+P+Das Experiment (Oliver Hirshbiegel, 2001)  Hirschbiegel, who stunned the world a few years back with Der Untergang, always had the chops to make tense, scary movies, and Das Experiment proves it. Also based on a true story, this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong, as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation, with eight "guards" and twelve "prisoners," for two weeks. By the second day, the guards are acting like guards, and the prisoners are acting like prisoners, with the exception of Tarek Fahd (Munich's Moritz Bleibtreu), ostensibly a cab driver, but actually an undercover reporter (while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done, the DVD box spoils this little surprise, so I have no qualms about mentioning it here) who's covering the experiment for his paper. Things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time, and while one of the doctors, Jutta Grimm (Andrea Sawatzki) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment, project leader Thon (Edgar Selge) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything's going to pot. Needless to say, things get out of control, and everyone involved, including the viewer, quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens, there is no way this is going to end well.  Hirschbiegel is a fantastic director, and here as in Der Untergang he's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent. If you've seen Der Untergang (and even if you haven't), check this out. It's well worth your time. ***+dvd
lousy script with nothing but.....????+N+either drinking, cursing, and laughing in the pub, or replaying the messy home life style. what is this? you call this 'one of the year's top 10 movies!', 'two thumbs up!', 'one of the year's funniest!'?????????? this is one of the most terrible movies with bore-to-death storylines i've ever seen. acting maybe acceptable but, with such a lousy script and a bunch of ugly young female actors, i have to pass. wasted my money was fine, but wasted 95 minutes watching this silly movie? well, absolutely not! rejected the dvd out of the player after about 15 minutes. thanks for nothing+dvd
...+N+horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al+dvd
On the HD-DVD relase+N+This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months). There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one+dvd
Good show about a great fighter plane in World War II+P+This DVD has been taken from a early-forties era documentary film made with Stateside audiences in mind.  It was probably shown in theaters before the main shows during the war years.  One of the big pluses is that the film is in color, and that the color is strikingly good for a combat film.  Directed by Academy Award winner William Wyler (best known for 'Ben-Hur' and the original documentary of 'The Memphis Belle'), the film depicts life--and death--in a P-47 Thunderbolt squadron based in Italy.  It gives the viewer a good look at Italy, not just the base itself.  The strafing runs are excellent, taken by a camera mounted in the planes on actual missions.  For a wartime propaganda film, it is quite honest and deals with the suffering of noncombatants, showing bombed-out buildings, children playing near a burned corpse, and haggard, war-weary men and women.   The aerial footage is excellent, the dialogue is good, and the quality of the picture is also good.  The film also shows the tragic results of a Thunderbolt crash quite graphically, as if to remind the viewer that war is a dangerous game and that there is never any guarantee that the pilots will return from their missions. This color film runs around 45 minutes.  It is well worth the price+dvd
Read on.....+N+You know a film is bad when you can't even finish watching it.  1. Russians don't fly F-16s or Northrop Tigersharks 2. Used airial combat scenes from Top Gun, Navy Seals and Iron Eagle. 3. Used ground explosions from Iron Eagle 4. SpecOp Forces don't manuever around like they are playing on a paintball range. 5. Editing was horrid (Airial cut scenes from films that take place in the middle eastern desert then jumps to what look like Pennsylvania woods) 6. Acting was so bad I started to chuckle at the cheesey lines and delivery. 7. Plot would be better suited for a computer game. 8. Captain of the 'USS Oakla'(no such ships exists) has a hat with SSN depicting his CARRIER's Class; well SSN means the hull classification symbol used by the United States Navy for an attack submarine that is propelled by nuclear energy, such as the Los Angeles-class of attack SUBMARINES.  This was as far as I got, about 50 minutes into the film. I'm no critic and can enjoy a film for what it is but this was the most slapped together garbage I have ever seen+dvd
A pale imitation of an innovator+N+I saw the show on stage.  I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this.  Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse.  Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute.  The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own.  As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate.  Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works.  Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical "Dancin'".  The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen.  He shows why he can still pack a house.  My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz.  You'll get to see the real Fosse+dvd
Great Shavian comedy+P+George Bernard Shaw wrote the screenplay based on his own very successful stage play of 1913, and he even took an Academy Award for it - and deservedly so. It's a crackerjack production, his best on screen.  Leslie Howard plays the overbearing Professor Higgins and Wendy Hiller is the Cockney flower girl transformed into a "lady." Both are perfect, and the whole thing is a lot better than the musical it became (MY FAIR LADY). It sparkles throughout, and the Shavian jabs at middle class society ("Marriage - it's the proper thing, but it's not natural") are wonderful and are just icing on an already rich cake. Definitely worth a watch+dvd
George Bernard Shaw, ingeniously...+P+George Bernard Shaw was simply ingenious when he wrote Pygmalion, and when the story was brought to the silver screen it did Shaw justice.  Pygmalion is a socioeconomic drama where the distinguished Dr. Higgins (Leslie Howard) takes the a flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller) under his wing in order to set a bet with Colonel George Pickering (Scott Sunderland).  The bet consists of transforming the poor flower girl into a lady of class, but this also means changing Eliza's manner of speaking.  Asquith and Howard illustrate several different topics such as tolerance and understanding using a familiar approach that the audience can recognize as Eliza undergoes the change.  In the end, Pygmalion offers an exceptional cinematic experience+dvd
Amusing Caper+P+"The Assassination Bureau" has an amusing premise and for the most part executes it ably enough.  Oliver Reed stars as the head of a consortium of international assassins who takes on an interesting assignment.  Crusading reporter Diana Rigg contracts his organization to kill him.  Reed takes up this proposal because he feels that it will enable him to weed out the weaknesses in the organization.  Assistant Chairman Telly Savalas has other ideas, however.  The film starts off well enough, has kind of a clunky midsection.  This portion of the film feels more slapsticky than darkly comic.  The film recovers and delivers a slam-bang ending.  Oliver Reed is charismatically suave as Ivan, the head of the Bureau.  Savalas and Curt Jurgens as a German associate are sublimely villainous.  Diana Rigg, however, isn't given much to do as Miss Winters.  The high point for her in this film is a scene where she is required to walk around in a bath towel.  Not classic comedy but not a bad way to wile away a few hours+dvd
Very Erotic+P+NUDITY!!!We get three different nude french chicks. All show bush. The film wasn't full of sex but it had this underlying erotic feel that just makes you horny. So when you did get to see some hot nude chick you were ready to go. The beast thing was strange but very erotic the way he kept getting harder and harder and the girl kept accidently getting him of as he spued gallons of semen everywhere. Nice full frontal and I found it very erotic. CAREFUL at the begining is some real horse sex. Gaint horse penis and throbbing femal horse vigina, I couldn't even watch it, very nasty, be ready to fast forward. What was the director thinking+dvd
Old Nick Shows+N+Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts?  THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD.  Not the shows that are still on air+dvd
Wack Christmas+N+Ok, first things first, I never seen the original, so I went into this flick with a clear, open mind. Bad move. BOOOORINGGGG as the day is long, about as scary as an episode of Home Improvement, suspenseful as an Applebee's commercial. Maybe the ending was good, seeing as I only made it through about 57 minutes before I had to take it out of my DVD player and sent it spinning frisbee-like across the room. If this was your idea of scary, "Dirty Dancing" must have REALLY freaked you out. Ho Ho Ho+dvd
This movie makes a 70's geology documentary look good+N+Geez, with all the remakes of old horror flicks these days, I'm losing faith in horror films altogether.  This movie goes to prove a point that horror movie creativity is headed south.  The plot sucked, the acting was predictable and the pulse was about as dull as the script itself.  I'm a fan of the Blair Witch mainly because it struck a chord of truth despite it's overly abundant attempt to be true, but the brothers who made that film wasted their budget on this junk.  There are no doubt kids in grade school that can conjour up better ideas, create more realistic suspense and drive you insane with terror.  But these days, horror directors fall back on old ideas, stale scripts with added gore and one or two decent actors, in hopes that their ship might sail, bringing in a budget that will carry them over until a newer, fresher idea surfaces.  Give me your budget, throw in the towel and let me scare the s#$t out of you, because if movies like these are all you have to offer up, then the genre of horror has a fate sealed in doom+dvd
Maybe Eduardo Sanchez has a future in horror!+P+Picked this dvd up on a whim.  I personally hadn't heard anything about it, but I saw it was directed by one of the guys who co-wrote and co-directed (whatever that means) The Blair Witch Project.  That's not great, but it was something to go on.  In the very least it promised that the storyline might be innovative.    I thought Altered was really good! It's a pretty simple plot: three hicks, who have been hunting aliens for seven years, finally catch one and take it to their friend's house. The friend, Wyatt, has had contact with the aliens before, having been abducted nearly fifteen years ago.  Most of the hijinks involves these four guys Wyatt's girlfriend and the abducted alien. The story is sort of derivative, combining elements from Night of the Living Dead, the original Alien and maybe a dash of Signs. But this managed to take those pieces and still make a highly suspenseful film!   The characters were fleshed out just enough where you cared what happened to them. Honestly Adam Kaufman's Wyatt stole the show. The man has charisma. As for the rest, in this day and age where every horror character is a sassy b*tch, it was nice to see dialog that was restrained and functional. They still managed to sneak a few jokes in, but they were so subtle and/or situational that it worked pretty well. The only one who comes across as an amateur is the girlfriend. I've seen oak trees that were less wooden than her delivery. Still, considering this was a nobody, no publicity, nothing, straight to video indie flick I'm surprised at how good she was in comparison to other similar projects.  The special effects were pretty good. Everything was hand made special effects, so you don't have any of that fakey CGI smeared around.  Movies ten times the budget haven't learned that lesson yet. The character design for the alien was pretty good. It sported an animatronic face and probably a small, athletic bloke in a rubber suit with the result being some of the best monster realism since Aliens.  The best part was the disembowel scene; realistic without being disgusting, a chuckling that's-gotta-hurt moment if I ever saw one.  Really, this was a pleasant surprise, given where the sequel to the Blair Witch went. Maybe Eduardo Sanchez has a future in horror after all+dvd
so bad that you wanted to watch it+N+This movie was so bad that one would want to watch it through to see how could anybody even think of making such a movie. ok it was not an expensive movie to make, but would be very interested to know if this was the end for the producers and director of this movie in this profession+dvd
Not worth even the 1 star.+N+Wow, i was shocked at this dvd release. i read a review of this dvd on amazon and i though its going to be amazing. but i was trully dissapointed. Derric Green is not a good vocalist for sepultura and he doesnt play good guitar which is needed for the old song from max's era. andreas cant play solos while playing old tunes because the drums and bass dont keep up and u dont even know what song they are playing at times its so bad. and as a stage performance by Green its terrible. he dont even know how to move on stage. the guest apperancec what the high lite on this dvd. the documentary is so lame i wouldnt even call it a documentary. its just a bad dvd but with a nice cover thats it. sorry sepultura, time for a change in the front office. aka Green Giant. sorry+dvd
A suprising delight+P+We rented this movie and watched it a dozen times with my kids (ages 4-6).  We kept it well past the return date and now we will end up buying it on amazon.  The kids are talented little actors and this was a nice movie for the family.  I can't count the number of times that little chimp made my 4 year old twins giggle and cheer.  Great job+dvd
Eric is way to tense on this one+N+Well this is going to be hard to say, because I like Eric, and I HIGHLY say these DVD's below are some of the best I have for Music.   Eric Clapton - Sessions for Robert Johnson (2004) DVD  Cream Reunion DVD   Also, this DVD is closed captioned, which is great! we need more of this!   But that's about it. Eric is so tense in this, you can just read it in him from the get go. I thought well maybe it will work out in the show, as many shows start off less that killer. But this show never got off. Sound is not that great either, its "ok" on sound, but something is not right, not sure what it is, older tech?   This is going to be hard to say in here but what are you people smoking that write great reviews? Have you ever even been to a concert? I have been to over 300 in 20 years. That's not to brag, but geez peeps, this show is not even close to cool. Maybe it's me and my 6th sense, people always tell me I can read people pretty good. Well, I tried, and I wanted! to like it! But sold it and without even letting anyone see it, that's how off this DVD is.      Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.    +dvd
He's no Robert Redford+N+After reading the novel The Great Gatsby for school I went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie. I absolutely adored it. It showed the characters personalities as they were in the book. After that we watched the 2001 version in school and I found it to be almost unbearable. The acting was poor exspecially on the part of Toby Stephens (Gatsby). He seemed like more of a mix of Joey from friends and Boy George than a love struck man. While the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining, over all I feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version+dvd
Zombie baby is too much+N+I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore+dvd
Hornblower was not a defiant jerk....+N+As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is "cool" or a "big man". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a "Question Authority" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, "cool" is the same as "cute"). Perhaps the other ones with this Ioan Gruffud are better, but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others+dvd
Why ALL of ANWR needs FULL Nat'l Wildlife Refuge protection or MORE; filmed with a touch of humor+P+Unfortunately, the 1002 Lands at the northwest corner of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge don't have this protection from possible oil drilling, in an area estimated to have oil reserves equal to less than six months of current needs.  More unfortunately, the Porcupine caribou herd doesn't recognize that it is in potential huge danger by coming here to calve every year, as the cows have for time immemorial from this large herd.  Husband-and-wife Heuer and Allison gave themselves a belated honeymoon -- follow the herd from its winter grounds to calving area and back, all while documenting it.  Heuer has worked in national parks programs in Canada and South Africa and already done yeoman environmental work by hiking the entire Yellowstone-to-Yukon or Y2Y corridor to popularize the need for extended wildlife area protections for large mammals.  The humor? The movie starts with clips of George H.W. Bush, followed by George W. Bush, both saying that they can't see the need for caribou protection.  So, Heuer packs a "W" doll with him for the entire journey, so he can see just why the herd needs its calving grounds protected.  An incredible journey through rugged land, fighting off cold and variety of incredibly ferocious flying insects, this is a fantastic wildlife effort.  Pair it with Heuer's book of the same name, and you'll fall in love with the herd too+dvd
could ANYBODY resist a taina elg musical?+N+george cukor only ventured into musicals on rare occasions. two of those ("a star is born" and "my fair lady") are classics; "les girls" is assuredly not. this was gene kellys last mgm musical, and cole porters penultimate score of any kind, and neither master is at his peak; as a matter of fact theyre both pretty close to their nadirs. kellys attempt at parodying marlon brando in "the wild one" (already a passe reference by the time this was filmed) is downright embarrassing, and the supporting "girls" (when mitzi gaynor is the biggest star among them) just kinda sit there like a lump. if thats entertainment ...+dvd
Dont be deceived+N+I thought this would be a fun. light evening - something to take my mind off my troubles - I am on ublic assistance so it is very hard to scrape together the money to rent a movie - I had free passes from Chirstmas so I go this with those.  I remeber loviing to dance when I was a litle girl - I tapped and did some jazz dancing - nothing like these ladies - who do almost nude dancing in this "family" film.  This story was about EMOTIONAL ABUSE - women suffering becasue some man has treated them like garbage.  I was abused my whole liffe until one day I took a walk to a store (my husband had hidden the keys from me - I looked for them but at the time I was drugging - hooked on meth) and found a book on emotional abuse that changed my life.  They shoudl remake this movie and the women should get revenge on the men for all the abuse.  No one will ever hurt me again+dvd
Very enjoyable!+P+I showed this to my middle school dance class and they loved it.  I did too!  If you love musicals from this era, it's a must-see+dvd
magic+P+a lovely romantic movie just to enjoy for what it is. lovely scenes of magical food preparations! ideal for all foodies+dvd
Cheese. With cornbread.+N+"All The King's Men" is a total mess and a spectacular misfire, a movie so poorly crafted by writer-director Steven Zaillian - who's directed some decent films - that it's not even fun to skewer. The acting is so arch and absurd, the story is so rootless and confusing and endless, droning, awful music is so melodramatic, that  it mostly earns, mostly, our pity.   Based on Robert Penn Warren's novel - itself based on the life of Louisiana politician Huey P Long - the movie uses narrator journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) to follow a backwoods orator named Willie Stark (Sean Penn) from county official to powerful governor. Stark is a populist, relying on his "hick" voters to give him carte blanche to redistribute government funds to public works projects - roads, schools, hospitals.   As "All The King's Men" opens, Stark is about to be impeached by the state legislature. For what? It's never made clear. Zaillian treats Stark like Jay Gatsby - nobody's quite sure of the truth. Instead of details, we get allusions and random subplots involving Jack's childhood friends (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo) and surrogate father (Anthony Hopkins). All three play a role in Stark's fate, but their characters are ciphers. None of the performances are memorable.   As Stark, Penn has two speeds. He's either a screamin bleeder, his voice breaking and his face ready to pop, or he's sleepily drawlin like he just ate a pan of cornbread. Stark speaks almost entirely in homilies, even in private moments. Penn's talent, which is turning the emotions of a role inside out, doesn't fit the role. He's bought too far into the myth of the guy.+dvd
I gotta catch my breath!+P+What a fun show! We saw this when it was first released and had such a good time rocking away. We always loved the artistry and staging. But it is the music that sells the project. So thrilled to find it on Amazon in DVD format! After so many years, it's still a great show+dvd
Caution Advised, But Still Great! +P+This 2nd chapter takes place almost immediately after "Zombie Island" concludes. While I don't consider this 2nd chapter quite as good as "Zombie Island," this 2nd chapter nails down the formula for a good sequel. It brings back enough familiar elements (the gang), but it offers a different adventure. While this 2nd chapter is not quite as intense as "Zombie Island," it would probably still be a good idea for parents to screen it before they give it to their children. Scooby and the gang solve a mystery (at least in part) at a museum and meet the writer Ben Ravencroft. He invites the gang to visit his 'quiet' home in Massachusetts. For an animated movie, the scenery is actually quite impressive. Well, Ben and the gang discover that the town is anything but quiet due to the publicity over the possible presence of a witch's ghost. (The Mayor and the T Shirt guy bear a striking resemblance to Boss Hogg and Sheriff Roscoe.) Naturally, our favorite gang gets curious but Scooby and Shaggy are more interested in food. (Big surprise.) There is a hilarious scene where they go to a restaurant that is too good even for them. Well, Ben and our gang meet the Hex Girls who play good music and at the same time draw some suspicion. This is a difficult movie not to ruin, but I'll try. The misleads make sense upon discovery, and just when we think the movie is over, we find out that the real horror is yet to come. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch of "Zombie Island," the climax is really well done and surprisingly scarey. Again, this movie may be a little too much for young children, but older children and even some adults are bound to enjoy this.   +dvd
One of the best films ever made.+P+I remember seeing this film as a young girl, and its impact has never left me.  This is one of those films that is not well known so naturally it gets overlooked.  This movie is truly scary in the sense that it plays with your emotions. Sure Friday the Thirteenth, Halloween, etc. are scary, but they rely on superficial violence and gore to lure their viewers. This film touches the human psyche; it brings out a realization that not all people are good and that there is pure evil in all places.  When a film can touch a person deep inside, that makes it an unforgettable classic. I would recommend anyone, expect very young children, to view this jewel of a film. +dvd
We love it!+P+This is one of our favorite movies (mine and my husband's).  The end is a little confusing the first time you see it, but the movie is excellent.  In 2004, I watched it three times in one weekend while writing a paper for a Lit class, and still loved it on Monday.  The deadpan delivery of Kevin Spacey is perfection.  When he catches his wife cheating and says "...you don't get to tell me what to do--ever again."  He could not have said it better.   Kevin Spacey portrays perfectly the average suburban man who is BORED with his life and is at the point at which he doesn't care who knows it. See this movie+dvd
MARIE WINDSOR-THE KILLING-WOW!+P+Director Stanley Kubrick's first "major" film was this vastly entertaining noir,"The Killing",dealing with the robbery of a Northern California race track engineered by ex-con Sterling Hayden.(great!)His "gang" includes such character actor stan-outs as Jay C.Fliipen,Joe Sawyer,Ted deCorsia,as a dishonest cop,Timothy Carey(as a sniper),and the noir immortal Elisha Cook,Jr.(The Maltese Falcon,The Big Sleep)and as Cook's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife Marie Windsor.Miss Windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed,but you will NEVER close your eyes while Marie is on screen,mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie,which she wares most spectacularly. Marie is great as Cook's disguisted wife,who pours out her vemomous insults toward's her little Georgie non stop and without remorse.Naturally,she is not (sexually and otherwise)satisified with George so she has a younger boyfriend on the side,played by a youthful Vince Edwards.The plans for the heist are all hush/hush,but George in order in impress Sherry(MW) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.Sherry, who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for Georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend's help,needless to say one seductive glance by Marie and Edwards is hooked.So when part of the gang meets to split the heist money,Hayden is late,the surprise will take place.The robbery goes OK,but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose!     Kubrick's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along,at a fast pace.The film is only eighty minutes.Sterling Hayden,who at one time I could not stand as an actor (I was a kid when I thought that way)gives his greatest performance to date,only to be topped by his role in Dr.Strangelove(also directed by Kubrick),and in the first Godfather film,as a dishonest Irish Police Inspector.Coleen Gray as Hayden's loyal girlfriend is fine,I believe here career should have been more productive,as she should have been given better roles.She her In Red River,as Wayne's girlfriend,and as Ty Power's naive wife in the noir classic "Nightmare Alley".But this is MARIE WINDSOR'S show and she runs away with it!If you love noir you will LOVE this film!+dvd
Ballroom 10 Dance Series 1+P+I have had a few ballroom dance classes and this series is a very good supplement to them.  Series 1 handles the very beginning steps and does not go very far, but it is an excellent starter series.  The instructors are very easy to watch and follow+dvd

It Only Gets Better From Here+P+St. Elsewhere remains my absolute favorite TV show, and it even ranks high among all of the other forms of entertainment that I enjoy, like movies, music and books.  It's the first show I remember watching that achieved a certain level of realism with its characters, and that had  continuing storylines without being a soap opera.  You could watch each episode without having seen previous ones, but you were definitely rewarded if you watched each week.  It was also the first show I remember that wasn't afraid to take risks with its many characters- they weren't perfect people, and sometimes very bad things happened to them.  St. Elsewhere was intelligent but highly entertaining TV, and it (and Hill Street Blues) paved the way for some excellent shows today that maintain similar standards.  And so I've waited for a long time for St. Elsewhere to be on DVD.  I'm not disappointed, but the first season is definitely different from later years.  I don't remember much of the first two seasons, but it seems to me that the show hit its stride in year two and peaked in it third and fourth seasons.  The first season is very good, but the characters haven't been developed quite as well as they would later, and its hard to be invested in some of them knowing that they would disappear after the first season with no explanation.  Also, some of the storylines (especially those involving the psychiatric wing of the hospital) seem silly and unrealistic- almost more like something out of a sitcom than from a serious drama.  Still, though, this is where it all started and it's clear that the groundwork was being laid for a great show.  Minor details mentioned here will become major storylines later on, and events that impact characters now will play even bigger roles later.  There are many genuinely emotional and dramatic moments, as well as interesting and well-written stories about medical cases and, more importantly, about the personal lives of the employees at St. Eligius.    It would have been nice to have more extras, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I'm glad that the first season is fully intact (although it seems like they did substitute some of the songs- that is definitely not Bruce Springsteen singing "Born to Run" in the first episode).  It's frustrating that there is no word yet on future seasons, but hopefully sales will be enough that we'll get the complete show in a relatively short period of time.      +dvd
Excellent  Pilates DVD !!!!+P+This is the best instructional pilates DVD! I really like the fact that Sarah has a section that shows you the basic moves and principles before you start the exercises. As a beginner, this allowed me to go back and make sure I was doing things correctly. It is a great work out and I know this is a DVD I will continue to use+dvd
DISAPPOINTED+N+Short, sweet, and to the point, I was extremely disappointed in this version of THE MIKADO.  I guess I should have known it would be a poor production when a NEW copy is selling for $1.62.  I learned a valuable, albiet inexpensive, lesson though.  From now on I will read the reviews before making a purchase+dvd
I've wanted to see this movie forever...+N+I've wanted to see I Am Curious - Yellow for what, 35 years now? It made headlines back in the 1960's when it was banned for having too much sex. Now I wonder what all the fuss was about. There was a little bit of sex, a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. Only the government could get worked up over this movie.  The other 98% of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism (this movie was made during the Vietnam era - the 1960's version of Iraq), Western support for Spanish dictator Franco, and social justice in Sweden. It might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today.  The movie (as well as the Blue version) might be good for historical purposes, but it just doesn't seem entertaining these days. I would have enjoyed it more in 1968. +dvd
Awful+N+The Call is set to Carnival music and is simply irritating.  The scenes are disturbing (for example a fly eating someone's head).  It is also dull.  I was neither entertained nor inspired by this.  I wouldn't watch the video again if someone paid me to view it.  It is a shame to get a video and immediately throw it away+dvd
So funny!+P+Very funny, but there aren't any special features. I find that a little problematic considering how many of the cast went on to do other things, especially recently. Also, seems like it could be remastered a little bit, but it wasn't a big deal+dvd
Promises much, delivers practically nothing+N+To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.+dvd
A let down+N+I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull+dvd
Sorry, but no.+N+So, before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies, let me state for the record that I am over 40, remember the Cold War very clearly, am not a PC leftist, and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce.  That said, this movie just didn't work for me. The premise was good, but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat. And except for Cagney, the actors were too shrill and strident. Everyone was straining SO HARD to get it across that "Hey, folks, this is REALLY FUNNY STUFF here, can't you see us sweat?" Comedy needs to appear effortless. This movie is wearisome.  Okay, let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin+dvd
Goldfinger is Gold Bond+P+Perhaps teething just a tad over the top, Goldfinger, unlike its two predecessors brought to the screen a polished, gourmet spy in James Bond.  No other cinematic spy comes close to Sean Connery's James Bond as portrayed in Goldfinger.  This movie has everything, beautiful and sexy women, cool cars, villainous villains, gadgets-gadgets-gadgets, surprises, and Sean Connery.  The plot became the standard in Bond formulas, much to all of our chagrins, but the story is pretty close to the original novel released by Ian Fleming in 1959.  This is easily the best secret-agent spy movie ever made, and for many reasons.  It is cinematically beautiful.  It has much daring-do for Bond to get in and out of.  The music is incredibly on target and set the stage for all Bond movies to follow.  The women are incredible.  The level of acting is top notch, from all performers.  In fact, one of the great things about this film is that Gerte Frobe, who plays Goldfinger, didn't speak of word of English, and his lines are dubbed in, but you would never know it by watching the movie.  Such an incredible flick.  Highly recommended.  That is, if there is a single person out there over the age of 18 who has not yet seen this masterpiece+dvd
wouldn't recommend it+N+Love Felcity Kendal in Good Neighbors, but this mystery stuff doesn't cut it plot wis+dvd
Utter Trash (Worst Slasher film ever created)+N+I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did  nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!!+dvd
Joy Ride+P+Talk about movies for guys who like movies, this is one joy ride for sure!!!  David Hess deserves the Best Actor Oscar for this completely ridiculous performance that makes you laugh one second, then become slack-jawed the next.  For the fellas, we get bush, nice boobs and some good action.....for the chicks, you might want to rent another flick...haha.....ENJOY!!+dvd
Draco would not approve of this.+N+I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart+dvd
not the best episode+N+The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends.  Their mission is to save "Friendship Day" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped.  It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken.  And what's more, the plot is really boring.  Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid.  The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY.  Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.  Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different.  It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice.  Dora sounds older.  There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them+dvd
One of the Best Adpatations Of A Novel To A Film+P+&quot;Mother NIght&quot; in not one of my favorite Vonnegut novels, but the film adaptation is superb.  This is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen from page to screen, and extremely thought provoking.  I give it my highest recommendation+dvd
A Really Cute DVD - a review of "Bob the Builder - Dig! Lift! Haul!"+P+This is a cute BTB DVD that has not only the regulars (Bob, Wendy, Spud, and the Crew) but many of the other favorite characters including Farmer Pickles, Mr. Beasley, and that tea making Mrs. Potts.  There is also Scruffty the dog, and some adorable mice and bunnies!  In the first story, "Scruffty's Big Dig", Scruffty the dog manages to fall into a bunny hole and get stuck.  Muck passes by and gets spooked by Scruffty's howling, but it all works out in the end when Bob and the crew solve the mystery and save Scruffty.   The second story, "Bob's Boots", has Bob breaking in new boots.  The boots squeak and attract mice, which as we all know Lofty does not like. Lofty ends up running for home, followed by Bob, followed by the mice -- which Bob doesn't realize are there.  Bob thinks Lofty is imagining that there are mice.  All of this in interweaved with a sub-plot wherein Spud takes Bob's lunch by accident.  The mice end up chasing Spud because he gave them some crumbs.  In the third story, "Mr. Beasley's Do-It-Yourself Disaster", Bob is hired to build a garden shed, while Wendy is busy painting Mrs. Pott's fence.  Chaos ensues when Bob gets diverted from the shed work to do a quick roof repair for Mr. Dixon.  Bob and Wendy keep missing one another; and Mr. Beasley begins the project himself, working under the misguided notion that he can use tools.    Wendy shows up to wonder what is wrong with Bob that the structure looks so crooked.  She repairs it and it's actually pretty funny when Bob and Mr. Beasley actually think Mr. B did the work.  The fourth story, "Spud Lends A Hand", is about the installation of a sprinkler system for Farmer Pickles.  Everything goes fine until Spud 'lends a hand' and advises the crew on how to finish the installation of a rain-tank.  Chaos results when Spud ends up giving advice to the Lofty and the guys.  The tank breaks loose and not only rolls down hill, but destroys Wendy's gift which is a sailboat.  Bob ends up saving the day when he takes the remains of Wendy's sail boat and turns it into a motor boat.    The final story is "Dizzy's Crazy Paving".  It's my favorite because it has Wendy in a 'if you have lemons, make lemonade' kind of situation.  Mrs. Pott's wants a new sidewalk and everything starts out fine until too much fooling around leaves the square pavers that they were going to use, broken up.  Wendy solves the problem by making a sort of crazy quilt sidewalk with the colorful tiles.    The stories are linked by the mischief, humor, and creativity.    Five Stars (for a Bob the Builder DVD).  Five classic Bob stories on this one.  My son loves this DVD and can watch it over and over.  Sometimes he will focus on what Bob is doing, and other times the equipment, and yet other times the little animals that in the stories: bunnies, dog, cat, bird, mice.  Great fair for rainy days+dvd
Good and Underrated+P+This movie features John Wayne not as a cowboy but as a football coach. It is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of John Wayne, comedy. It is a good movie though. When I first watched it I was amazed. Everyone (from Wayne to the actress that plays his daughter) does an excellent job. John Wayne's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player, and he also played football at USC for a couple of years with Ward Bond. So it is a subject he knows well. Overall, it gives light to a new side of the Duke, the comical side (which isn't bad). It isn't one of the best, I grant you, but it is great because it shows Duke's acting talents with a great script and cast+dvd
The Funnier Side of Vietnam+P+Although the subject matter itself isn't amusing the characters in the film are.  They seem to make light of a bad situation, the likes of which aren't seen anywhere else that I know of with the exception of Good Morning Vietnam.  I enjoyed the action scene in this film almost as much as I enjoyed the comic releif, but not as much as I liked the music+dvd
I expect erotism and I get porn scenes+N+This movie is a hoax. I expect to see a good erotic drama with Laura Gemser, and I get porn scenes...+dvd
Four Dances? You get three.+N+This DVD claims to teach you four dances: The waltz, foxtrot, social quickstep, and the tango. What they fail to mention however is that the instruction for the foxtrot and the social quickstep are exactly the same. The only difference between the two is the speed of the music playing in the background.  The dances are very thoroughly taught, until you get to the tango. The waltz, which is probably the second hardest dance to learn, takes the most time to learn with it taking up probably forty-five minutes of the DVDs total play time. The quickstep and foxtrot, both the easiest dance to learn, take up about a half-hour each, and the tango, the hardest to learn, they zoom through in about fifteen minutes, as if they were afraid of running out of time on the dvd. The video is relatively low quality, and after a time, the voices of the instructors tend to get on your nerves.  Pick this one up if you want to learn the basic steps, but that's about all you're going to get, and remember that it's three dances, not four. Once you've learned the foxtrot, you know the social quickstep+dvd
83 minutes of my life wasted.+N+What a waste of time this movie was. I could not wait for it to end. To call this an amateur film is an insult to amateurs.  While I was watching it, the power in my house went off. I kinda hoped it would stay off.  What I liked about it was the cover, thats it. I think they should just sell the case without the DVD. Or throw a blank DVD in the case.  Here is the movie in a nutshell: horrendous acting, garbage script, filmed on what appeared to be a $50 video camera.  AVOID THIS TRASH! The 1971 Zodiak Killer was bad too, but it was the kind of bad that was worth watching. Not this movie+dvd
Dreadful+N+When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap.  Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video.  It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia.  When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed.  The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it.  Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it.  The debate over this film is rather like the story, "The Emperor's New Clothes", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not.  This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it.  Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.     +dvd
Greatly disappointed+N+Well I loved the book by Joseph Heller even though it can be hard to follow at times. The movie, however, was a huge let down. I did not expect it to be as good as the book, nothing ever is, but this was just bad. The cast sounds great, but the acting too over the top if you ask me. Especially Arkin as Yossarian, he just annoyed me. There were many characters I came to like while reading, but this movie doesn't give you a chance to like any of them. So much of the book is left out, which is to be expected, but it doesn't make any sense if you haven't read it. The anti-war commentary is almost completely lost and it has basically been turned into a comedy. Overall this was a terrible movie, especially considering how good the book was. It gets two starts simply for being associated with the book. Don't waste your money, just read the book+dvd
Absolutely Horrible+N+As a sequel to a mega-hit movie this was a stinker. The thing I loved about the original was how it captured the late 50's with music, custumes, and attitudes and yet this sequel seemed to fall flat on it's face in all those categories. The songs are so out of place with lots of 80's ish themes being played during certain scenes. The producer couldn't even focus on one time period with the music which ranged from 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's metal at one point. The mood and feel of the movie was wrecked by this alone, without including the fact that the songs themselves were utterly boring. One or two songs were ok, like "Reproduction" and the biker song by Michelle Pfeiffer.  If you buy this thinking it's a real sequel to Grease you are sadly mistaken. There's not alot in common at all with the first movie other then a few characters and the "T-birds" and "Pink Ladies". The plot is totally cheesy also. I'm not sure what I hated worst, the fact that some of the hairstyles and music reminded me more of the 80's or the predictable plot of the movie. "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" , "The Breakfast Club" & "Sixteen Candles" are so much better movies at representing the 80's if you are looking for a movie like that. The last thing I wish to see is a movie suposedly set in 1961 is for it to coming off in all respects to be 1982.   When I watch movies like this, I like to be transported back to a place in time and feel the period completely. Unfortunately Grease 2 leaves me wondering exactly what time period it was supposed to represent.  The only saving grace of this movie is watching a young Michelle Pfeiffer with brown eyes instead of her usual and what I thought was her natural blue eyes+dvd
Worst of the Worst+N+I can't believe I spent my $25 Amazon coupon on this drivel. After reading the reviews I thought this might be a good addition to our growing collection of DVDs. NOT!!!! My dh and I have voted this the WORST movie of all time. "The Night of the Lupus" was our old worst. How can I return this disaster+dvd
Favorite Film+P+Eighteen years ago we left California's Central Coast to live in Wisconsin where we've endured many a frozen winter evening with a bowl of popcorn and a movie or two.  Of the many movies this means we've seen, I'd have to say The Lady Vanishes ranks as pretty much my all time favorite.    I love the tension of the plot against the innocence of the time.  This is a time we don't well know today - a time of gentle courtesy and concern for others; wrongness of bad things happening is simply obvious.  This slice of a different day shows us life before electronic entertainment - the vaudvillian dancing, the whistling, the intricacies of human interaction and friendship - the respect shown automatically by the lady and her friends for each person. This is also before actors needed to be 'flawless' and shallow.  Cruel enemies - both nationally and personally - slash this quiet, peace filled world. There is something valuable and instructive in this window to the past. A bit of accidental history that portrays wholesome times under international threat and prevailing open human goodness.   It may be an odd reason to like a film so much, but there it is.  This great plot, action, tension against the backdrop of a kinder and very real day, provide the kind of cultural fresh air that can give both perspective and direction+dvd
Zombie baby is too much+N+I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore+dvd
Made-for-cable schlock+N+&quot;Random Encounter&quot; tries to make Elizabeth Berkeley look like a good actress but it cant be done, sorry.  the story is so-so, and very by-the-book+dvd
One of the best nazi films ever made+P+The best part of the movie was when the sentances were carried out. The men who did the atrocities to the jews deserved so much more but got what they deserved in the long run. I absolutly love this movie and the book.+dvd
Too bad no language options...+P+Everything about this DVD was perfect... except they don't have the original Japanese version as an option in it. I know lots of people who like to switch it to Japanese and put on the English subtitles instead of watching Funimation's version of the show. This DVD has no language or subtitle options, so as long as you don't mind watching only the American version, it's a great dvd.   I gave the dvd five stars anyway though, because Yu Yu Hakusho is too great a show to deserve any less. This DVD is the first of the Dark Tournament Saga, it is the next dvd after "Rescue Yukina" and is the dvd before "Deathmatch". I don't have to state the episodes since someone already has prior to me. Enjoy the show+dvd
A great film+P+In spite of minor issues related to censorship of nudity, which do not affect the plot, the cinematographic version of the play is excellent. Both the acting and the recreation of the atmosphere of the Spanish Barroque are major achievements of this film. +dvd
Not enough info from Amazon+N+Nowhere on the product description did it mention the content enclosed in the gift set, leading me to believe it was new or unique material. Unfortunately, it is 4 DVDs, one for each comic, 2 of which I already owned.  Enlosed is  White:Tater Salad Cable Guy:Git-r-Done Foxworthy-Redneck Engvall:Here's your sig+dvd
A total Let Down+N+Sorry People but this dvd sucks, and I love Rick.. But this is like watching a root canal take place.  it falls flat in every way you can imagine. I wish I had kept my money..+dvd
Evel Knievel deserved better then this flop. +N+This movie was on TNT and the dvd will not make it any better. This might be worse then Viva Knievel from 1977. While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . You never find out why Evel started to jump for a living. They never show the showman part of Evel. Instead they show really stupid things like Evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie.+dvd
Great movie...VERY disappointing DVD release...+N+This is one of my favorite comedies.  It's not for everyone, as you must understand Martin's unique style of humor.  That having been said, the DVD is awful.    The transfer is decent, although could have been cleaned up more.  Luckily, it's at least anamorphic widescreen.  The sound, while hardly sounding like 5.1, still sounds decent, as i doubt surround sound was on the mind of film makers in 1979.  Seriously, it's not Star Wars.    Extras?  Fugetaboudit!  NO commentary.  NO making-of.  NO interviews.  Just one delected scene, trailer, and a dumb ukelele lesson.  The WORST part!  There are scenes missing!  Perhaps this version of the film is exactly as it was released in the theaters, but i'm too young to know.  However, every time i've seen it on television, there were scenes not present in this release...such as the several different people requesting donations from the rich Navin Johnson.  In this, you only get the Mexican priest.  Where's the guy who needs new seat covers on his plane?  That scene was classic!  You know, this is the SECOND release of this film on DVD, and they call it an "Anniversary Edition."  If they're going to give it a name like that, they could at least include the cut of the movie with extra scenes added back in.  Maybe the commentary and a simple 15-minute making-of is asking too much, but at least give us the material that's already in the can+dvd
DON'T BUY THIS!+N+They cut major scenes out of this film, which makes no sense to me.  This movie needs to be released in its original format.  They could have took out the pointless special features and used the full movie.  It really makes no sense when the movie comes on TV it is the full version -- very sad+dvd
Disappointed in this DVD+N+I thoroughly enjoy salsa, and enjoy learning from DVD's and tapes.  The title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance.  Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda, not salon style or club salsa.  Although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion, rueda requires the expected step to be called out, somewhat in the latin version of square dancing.  So if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style, leading with non verbal ques, this is not your DVD.  +dvd
My friend has a better title: "Glimpses of Bob"+N+I'm giving this one star because "zero stars" isn't an option. There's not a whole lot of Dylan in this, and the "home movies" are just what you'd expect from the days of 8mm film: grainy, blurry, black and white films from the tour...not "of the tour", just from the tour. Tourist kind of stuff, with a lot of the back of Dylan's head, and every once in awhile he'll turn around - which is why my friend has retitled this DVD "Glimpses of Bob".  And listening to Mickey Jones reminisce about his glory days of 40 years ago is kind of tedious; Mickey's looking like he's seen better days.  Save your money up and get "No Direction Home", much more entertaining and informative+dvd
Very good dark Jackie movie.  Seriously, he is in a dark movie!+P+Wow did this one catch me by surprise.  I thought for sure I was getting another goofy Jackie movie.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!  The movie starts out with Jackie as a drunken cop.  After showing him in some disgusting drunken moments, we get to see why he became like this.  There is a group of kids going around terrorizing the police.  They will do a standard bank job or something like that and then wait for the cops.  Having serious firepower, skills that will relate to the x games later in the movie, and already being rich, the cops certainly have theri hands full.   So the cops have serious problems and they finally get Jackie in a deadly game of 'can you do this to keep your fellow officers alive'?  Needless to say he doesn't and becomes a drunk.    When the band of x-games teens are causing trouble again a young cop tries to get Jackie to help out.  I know you have probably heard this type fo a cop story before but this movie is seriously one of the best looking movies I have seen in a while.  All of the locations and buidings they are in are great to look at.  If you have seen Jackie Chan's Who am I?, Rumble in the Bronx, or even the well done First Strike, then get ready for a change.  New Police Story has very high production values and it is not cheesy.  Might not be what you are used to in a Jackie movie, but it was a very nice change to see this.   The movie gets between a 3.5 and a 4 but could have gotten a 5.  Rongguang Yu(the Iron Monkey) is in this movie and him and Jackie do not fight.  That dissapointed me just a bit, but they still had some really good scenes together.  The special features are pretty good with behind the scenes, behind the dubbing of Jackie doing his voiceover and a commentary for 2 scenes.  Also the picture is widscreened but the picture quality needs to be commented on. It seemed like I was watching a high definition TV.  Very nice+dvd
kung-pletely disappointing!+N+I love Jackie Chan. I love his stunts, his martial arts and the honor and humor that envelope his movies. This movie, put simply, dissapointed me. Granted I watched half an hour of this movie and ended it there. The movie lacked the usual enthusiasm and honor of a Jackie Chan movie. I was put off by the cops hanging suspended in the air gasping for breath, the gory blood and the constant reliance on violence to get it's point across. Many Jackie Chan movies get their point across without senseless, over-the-top and disgusting violence. The movie is poor quality, low budget, which I generally like being a fan of all things swordplay fantasy kung fu and martial arts across the board and through china and flowing into korea and japan. This movie, however, lacked anything redeeming...atleast the part of the movie I watched.+dvd
First season was brilliant but second season is a huge disappointment+N+I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters.  The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate.  I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp.   I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake. +dvd
Masque of the Red Death+P+Masques of the Red Death does not follow the storyline of Poe's story enough for me to use in the classroom.  However, the tension and suspense is great+dvd
Go with the editor's review!!+N+After reading the editor's review I was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge Buffy / Angel / Bones fan.  Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered.  Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it.  I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through.  This movie was terrible.  The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen.  Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan!  What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?+dvd
At he top of her game+P+Before she became so outrageous, she was really a good entertainer. This is her at her very best, and includes all of her most popular hits. Don't really like her now, but loved her then. Lots of memories. A great show, very enjoyable+dvd
One of the First and still best television docu-dramas! +P+In the fall of 1974 I gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening. By chance, a commercial announced that "The Missiles of October", one of television's first attempts at a docu-drama (the other being The Andersonville Trial) was about to come on. We decided to wait 'a few minutes' to see some of it. Three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on. Silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of "you are there" that kept us riveted to the story. Looking back now I realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average American, namely, what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of October of 1962, when the world was on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. This work is very intellectual, superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes. It is important to remember that this was shown during an era of STRONG anti-military feeling. The country was winding down from Vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what America CAN accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict. There is a LOT of good acting. The scenes are cleverly done, shifting between Washington and Moscow with tid-bits of B&W 'events in the world' film thrown in. We get to see "inside" the exec committees of both the White House and Kremlin and how they plot strategy. Attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably. "Pueblo" in 1976 did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what I now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen. WELL RECOMMENDED.+dvd
Would have been better had they not called it DnD+N+Basically I'm a fan of B-Movie fantasy films as well as a long time DnD player. I can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and I'd easily say that its not the worst B-Grade fantasy film ever made. However as a DnD movie it blows.  I'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject. I can fully understand the need to change some things. This is a movie and unlike some purists I understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different. However this film bore almost NO resemblance to DnD. Fortunately when the sequel (Wrath of the Dragon God) was made this was fixed.   Basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie. If you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok B fantasy movie that it is.+dvd
Carmen Jones+P+I first saw this film when it premiered back in the mid-fifties. I remember wondering why there were no white people in it.  I was very young at the time and not living in the US and was not privee to the political climate here.  I waited to see this film a second time and saw a 'cut up' version on TV in the 60's.  Despite its condition and the breaks for mindless commercials, the film was still entertaining and Carmen was dazzling.  The film seemed to 'disappear' after that until the 1980's when I saw a showing at the Public Theatre in New York City - bless Mr. Papp for screeing it.  Over the years, I have seen many operas and now know how 'grand opera' is presented.  Still, I think that this is a valant effort and is worth seeing.  The lyrics are great and worthy of the music.  Ms Dainbridge remains excellent as Carmen and was certainly was sexy, as Carmen should be - unlike so many that have played the part in grand opera!  One can sympathize with the young soldier going AWAL.  The one oddity is hearing someone else's voice coming from Harry Belefonte's mouth.  This film is definitely worth seeing+dvd
Adrien Paul , the only reason to watch The Breed.+N+I rented this movie because i love adrien paul in highlander and well the premise that he is a vampire makes it all the sweeter. Unfortunatly he alone could not carry the film. The movie is set in an skewed alternate version of the reality we all know. The version we get is a neo nazi like world in a bleak black and blue hue. The funny thing right off is the human police station is littered with propaganda messages and posters. Why the filmakers put that in this movie is beyond me. I guess their trying to convey the surrealism of this world. Vampires in this "reality" exist and recently exposed themsleves to humans at a risk of being demonized. Then when the process is at its critical stage, a serial killer emerges from the shadows and starts picking off young college girls. We find out that the killer is a vampire and has a political agenda. Which is to stop the vampires assimilation into humanity. A great premise which is killed at the very begining.The acting at best was a classic b-film. The actors look as though they know that the script sucks but they try to make it seem as if it doesn't. Adrien Paul is very convincing in his role as vampire cop Aaron. He is the only bright spot in the film. Bai Ling is a eccentric female vampire who falls for Bookem Woodbine's character. I forget his characters name because he was as wooden as you can be. He doesn't fit the whole "tough cop in a bad situation trying to make the most of it" kinda guy. The scenes in themselves seem ridiculous. At one point in the film Adrien Paul's character is shooting at human cops because they attacked first i guess. He does this spinning in the air thing and you can obviously tell that he's spinning on wires. The sex scene reminded me of well a soft core porno because the music in that scene sounded just like the chessy music in such a film. Minus the nudity. You see them bumping and grinding but it never really goes anywhere. And they like showing a pillar apparently in the "bedroom" with ivy and water pouring down it. Maybe that is an innuendo. The nudity that is in the film is downright ridiculous and makes the audience feel embarrased to watch it. Over all i think it could have been done better and i only watch it to see adrien paul in all his sexy vampire glory. I'd let him bite me anytime+dvd
I liked it. Worth the $$$ to me+P+After reading the many lukewarm reviews here, I didn't have very high expectations for this DVD of a 1998 documentary produced in part to hype the Lost In Space motion picture released around that time. But after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s Dr. Smith and Will Robinson in character circa 1998, I knew I HAD to have this.  Turned out the documentary itself wasn't half as bad as I had been dreading. In fact I'd say overall it's pretty decent. Yeah, so John Laroquette is irrelevant to LIS, but I've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter (--hell, Bill Mumy himself sometimes acts as host of Biography). At least Laroquette wasn't particularly irritating here like he could have been.  Maybe if you're a hardcore LIS fan who has read every book and article available on the subject, then there probably won't be much new here for you. But as someone who always enjoyed the show but hasn't really gotten into the fandom side of things, this documentary was just right for me and I picked up many a new fact here and there (eg.: John "Star Wars" Williams did the music for LIS too? I did not know that. And the guy who did the robot's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit? I did not know that either.)   It was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in 1998 and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since.  I also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic LIS with more background info on the show. It really helps to show them how important this show is to many people (yes, I am NOT a freak for liking this!), and why. After watching this, they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance.  Bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers (now also available on one of the LIS TV show DVDs), some SFX footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show's pilot (I was surprised it was in colour. Did they shoot all the B & W shows in colour first?), and Guy Williams' screen test for Irwin Allen to get the part of Prof. John Robinson (my squeaky-clean image of Prof. Robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when Williams seems intent on revealing to Irwin Allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at. Gah!)  But the real highlight here is of course the scene with Will and Dr. Smith. Both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set, and the Jupiter II mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too. The scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly, but I have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them. It will be the last, unfortunately, due to the death of Jonathan Harris just months after. I really wish they had done more like this and sooner, but I guess something is better than nothing....  So for me, this disc was the perfect way to complete my LIS DVD collection. Just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the Space 1999 DVD Megaset, it adds that last little something extra that's really nice to have. I think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print, so grab it while you can.  (--And for any people reading this from the DVD-making biz, howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow "Family Feud" that they mention in this documentary, where the cast of LIS were guests? I'd buy that!+dvd
Junk, the whole movie should've ended up on the cutting room floor+N+I didn't read the book; I purchased it based on the actors, that was a huge mistake.  Had I paid attention to the people who rated this with one star I could have spared myself the anguish of watching it.  I have 24 movies with Bruce Willis in them and its goes without saying I now have 23 this went in the trash. I wouldn't think of even giving it away for fear someone found out I actually paid money for this garbage.  I have a collection pushing 1800 DVDs and this is the first time I have had to write a negative review+dvd
EURO SLASHER+N+ANATOMY reminded me of some of those European horror flicks of the seventies like TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE or SUSPIRIA.  Franka Potente (who gained American notice in the two BOURNE movies) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the Hippocratic oath.  This society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who aren't dead!  The movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes, and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike.  The identity of the villain(s) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity, it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending, and with sequel written all over it.  (ANATOMY 2 was made a couple years later).  It's comparable to our teen slashers, but because of the foreign aspects, it seems a little cheesier+dvd
not too serious, but definitely fun+P+Wow, the reviews here are pretty high strung, like they're expecting this to be some kind of serious avant garde film, critiquing the early 80s, the art/fashion scene rebellion against the dullness of suburbia, sexuality, etc.  I suppose you could try to load all of that into this, but I saw it as a parody that pokes fun at these types of pretention more than anything else.  You get some of the atmosphere from that time, the characters and acting are pretty good, and it hangs together as scifi.  There are some fun mind games in it as well, which are surprising to some viewers, but I do not want to reveal the hilarious plot twists.  That is about it, no big deal, nothing all that deep.  If you look at it as, well, entertainment, you can allow yourself to enjoy it for the fairly simple thing that it is.    Recommended.  Warmly+dvd
Yet Another Bad Career Choice for Colin Firth Whose Excellent Acting Is the Only Merit of This Messy Film+N+Nothing is wrong with `Trauma' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned. Colin Firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident, and John Mathieson's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting. Except that, however, `Trauma' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll. As for the film itself, it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery, drama, character study, or whatever that is worth spending my time.  Colin Firth plays Ben, who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris, '28 Days Later'). In spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named Charlotte (Mena Suvari), Ben's mental condition gets worse and worse, and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares. In addition to the premise that is no longer original, the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress (or singer ... sorry I forgot which) that does not convince me at all. And the most surprising thing is, Ben might be the prime suspect of the murder! But how? and why?  The script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things I pointed out above, Ben must meet a seer (played by Brenda Fricker) who says something very predictable, and his estranged sister who is just forgettable. There are also big red ants crawling all over, paintings that imply nothing special, and the CCTV surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in UK. All these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students. The difference is, probably they know what they are doing better.  I simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking (which it is not), and sincerely wish that Mena Suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days+dvd
Dull romance capped by effective suspense.+P+Like many Hitchcock films, the first half of Notorious is more romance than suspense, but the second half pure noir.  Cary Grant recruits Ingrid Bergman, daughter of a former Nazi spy, to spy for his agency.  They apparently fall in love before ever starting an assignment.  Grant and Bergman were two of the most attractive people of the 20th century, but for me, unfortunately together they almost bored me.  I guess the chemistry just wasn't there; that's my opinion, maybe you'll disagree.  However the suspenseful part of the plot picks up when he assigns her to spy on Claude Rains (The Invisible Man, Lawrence of Arabia).  The best way she can find to get close to Rains, who knew her father, is to let him romance her, eventually resulting in a marriage proposal.  Some of the most suspenseful sequences of any Hitchcock film occur as she's trying to get information from Rains, exploring his big mansion in South America.  The suspense builds to a satisfying climax, making Notorious at least a 4-star movie, perhaps one of Hitchcock's top five, but not as good as North By Northwest or The Man Who Knew Too Much+dvd
Hard Core HK Action+P+This is a hard core action film that keeps you on the toes. It potrays friendship and betrayal. Here we get to see the magic of Chow Yun Fat in action. His charactor Jeff is no Mr. Debonair-Distinguished-Gentleman but a gangster with a mission. Determined to payback the betrayal dished out to him in a robbery gone awry Jeff goes up against an equally dangerous gangster who happens to be gay and attracted to him. This is where the comedy comes in and Simon Yam does a good job of portraying the gay gangster. This is a must have for fans of Chow Yun Fat and Hong Kong cinema+dvd
Great Film - fox lorber version.... at least it's cheap+P+Ophuls is a master film maker and watching Lola Montes is to watch what movies at their best are capable of. That said, I am interested to know what happened to the missing segments of this film - you always hear about it being cut callously - but I am not sure whether the original film still exists... Anyway, see the movie despite inferior versions+dvd
Great setting and premise but fails badly at delivering any substance...+N+I took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and I have been into thrillers lately. So, I tried it.  The scenery was terrific, the setup had lots of promise, and the cinematography was eerie.  So, what went wrong?  Easy.... the plot was empty and as others have stated, nothing ever really came of anything.  There were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing.  Again, great camera work and the building was truly creepy.... but thats not what makes a great thriller. You have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any.  And the characters....Uggggh!  The film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them I would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow, painful way.    Go ahead and try it if you'd like but I suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices. Ultimately, it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters. Its not the worst I've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour.  Not recommended+dvd
Magnificent 2nd time around+P+The dvd was just as good as I remembered the tv show to be. The show is both funny and serious with some of the best characters in it played by highly underrated actors. Even if you don't like 'westerns' have no fear this is not a western. It is a fun show for all ages+dvd
stupid and unrealistic+N+Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ)  but this movie didn't get any fact right.  the church is never mentioned by name for a reason.  polygamy.  look like Amish.  a collection plate?  this movie stinks and i'm very offended+dvd
Pure Stoke.+P+I own a lot of surf DVD's, long board,short board,mix of both.What makes Singlefin special from the others is that it really is a surf "movie" with a story. Shot on film with great care. ANY surfer will love the pure stoke which moves through out this film. A must for surf DVD collectors who love the life of surfing.+dvd
Complete butchering of a good story+N+I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.  Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.  I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply "everybody must die!".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.  Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.  I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence "revealing" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.  Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie+dvd
With Friends like this...  +N+Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, I guess because people think he does a decent Irish accent.  Nevertheless while under the drink mixing tutelage of "Obi-wan" Coughlin (Brown) he gets involved with Coral (Gina Gershon) later telling Coughlin of their bedroom exploits.  To ensure that Flanagan sees the light, Coughlin sleeps with Coral to try to show Flanagan she was no good for him.   Why Coral would sleep with Coughlin just because Flanagan said they were making nikki-nikki is a mystery (she's seen sleeping over at the apartment and all cuddily with Tom's character for God's sake).  Anyway, what a pal, nice to see Coughlin really cares.  Later, actually just a brief dissolve to ocean shores & islands, despite this friendship-ending dastardly deed Flanagan befriend's Coughlin while working in Jamaica.  Now that (Brown) has found "true" happiness (Lynch), you'd think he'd want the same for (Tom), right? Wrong.  Despite Flanagan's seriously developing affinity for Jordan (Shue), he dares (Tom) to bed the mature, rich and connected Bonnie (Lisa Banes).  Of course, this destroys Cruise & Shue's chance for romance, despite his explanation that it's okay because "when a guy lays down a dare, you just got to."  What kind of logic is that?  Still later trying to make up with her, he claims he got spooked by Jordan, so which one is it?  Finally, how nice for Hollywood to wrap everything up with death, attempted seduction, pregnancy, attempted bribery, and Flanagan striking out on his own in one of the riskiest businesses around a "Theme" bar.   Although, cute at times, one has to wonder the next time someone dares Tom's character+dvd
Peter, Paul, & Mary+P+Excellent overview of their whole careers.  Good selection of songs and locations.  Fun for fans.  Also a good summary for those who have never heard them or seen them before.  Recommend it for all ages+dvd
Enjoyable And Entertaining: A Fun Watch!+P+"Shinobi-Heart Under Blade," is a fun and entertaining film. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film; and if you have viewed Azumi 1 & 2, or Takeshi Kitano's film "The Blindswordman Zatoichi," then you will enjoy this film. I was given this film by a friend as a Christmas present, and just recently viewed it; and I must write that I found it highly enjoyable. There is CGI in the film, but it did not bother me, considering the abilities of the various ninja's depicted in the film would more or less require its use. Also, the story itself is based from Japanese manga, called "Basilisk." And although I have not had a chance to look at these, I might someday. Just thought that I would pass this along.   The film is set in 17th-century Japan. In the film there are two Shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years. The two tribes are called the IGA and the KOUGA. They have been forced to obey a decree by the Shogun who has unified Japan, and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting. Two of the ninja's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love: They are Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri) however, both must keep it a secret. The Shogun however, sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him, and decides that a tournament be held. Five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death. These different ninja characters are extremely colorful. Each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting. As I wrote in the beginning, this is not an Akira Kurosawa type film, such as "Seven Samurai," therefore, suspension of disbelief is necessary.   Moreover, you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a Kurosawa film: so what! the film is a fun watch anyway. I would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film, however, I can live with this, as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy. However, the acting in the film is very good. Since the film comes from comic and anime origins, the characters do not dissapoint the viewer. The film seems a bit comic-book at times, but that is one of the reasons I think I enjoyed the film so much more. And besides, the visuals I believe were done incredibly great. Also, while not like your typical Japanese film, in terms of swordplay, the film is still enjoyable: remember this does derive from Manga.   In the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight: the winners will serve the Shogunate, the loser will be vanquished. All of the fights take place while enroute to the capital, while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind. (Jo Odagiri) and (Yukie Nakama) give good acting perfomances in the film, which in turn makes this a better film. Once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'Romeo and Juliet,' to some degree. Once again, this is an enjoyable Japanese film, not to be taken seriously, or on par with some of the great Samurai epics of the past, just an enjoyably entertaining film. Also, I thought some of the characters' powers, such as one ninja being able to slow down time were interesting, as it departs so much from much of Japanese cinema, in contrast to Chinese cinema, where this is so prevalent. All in all, a delightful and fun film. Enjoy it, and don't take it too seriously. [Stars: 4.5+dvd
This Movie Has Disturbing Situations...+N+I bought these movies based on reviews and was puzzled when I noticed my 3 year old son was afraid of the green choo choo train. I couldn't imagine why until I replayed the movie and saw the scene where the green train was headed toward a woman stranded, yes, stranded!, in her vehicle on the train tracks. As she waved her arms in panic and stares at the oncoming train, she screams stop! I cannot imagine how this fosters a safe feeling for children unless you are into the scare tactic approach to teaching.   I was really upset and offended that this was put into a kid friendly show. Sadly, I do not recommend this DVD. The idea of it is great, but the delivery was more than poor. I will return the others I purchased+dvd

Missed potential and lame music+N+There is some really great computer animation from this era, a.k.a some of the Mind's Eye series and the like.  But this one was, basically, a bore.  First, the music was completely uninteresting and showed little or no connection to the animation.  It sounded like half-baked baroque or classical done on a good-quality Casio.  I could live with that, though, if the animation really grabbed me.  Or, even better, if they seemed to have anything to do with each other.  But the animation was, as my title implies, a tease.  There were many, many brief moments were something truly interesting appeared only to be immediately abandoned for yet another kaleidoscope sequence.  There was a lot of those.  No, way too many of those.  And I'm sorry, but I can pick one up at the dollar store if I want to see that.  Also, if you hate having things flashed at you, there were a lot of those annoying instances where they transition from one image to the next with a bright flash.  Very obnoxious.  For really good animation and music, in favor of this I'd highly recomment Televoid (music by a mix of Queensryche and Kansas members) and The Gate to the Mind's Eye (Thomas Dolby).  Both these have much more interesting animation and really great music.  As for this, if you already have any 90's animation that you really like, you'll be missing absolutely nothing by skipping this one+dvd
What is the point of this film?+N+...I mean,other than making a profit for the studio(which,I understand,did not happen yet)...Whoever wrote the script for this doofus movie ought to be re-trained,and put to work doing street-cleaning,or garbage pick-up,or something that he/she can't screw up...Better yet,re-train the actors and actresses involved because obviously they did this turkey for the paycheck alone and gave no thought whatsoever to the audiences that would have to sit through this drivel... The premise of this film had potential,but someone,or,more probably,some committee decided ,Hey,we don't want to make anything that is actually good...Heavens no...what we want is a made-for-teevee spook story with a made-in Hollywood big budget...Where did"White Noise"go wrong?Almost from the begining...So apparently some lower level employee of the Michael Keaton charecter is some sort of nutcase serial killer who just may be in the control of some trio of disembodied demons...or something...Keaton's pretty,pregnant second wife goes out for a drive and never returns..Did she slip,fall,and get carried away in the river?...apparently not...apparently the afore-mentioned nutcase serial killer tortured and murdered her,maybe at the instigation of the demons(or maybe just because he is a nutcase serial killer...who can be sure?)...Anyway,one day some over-weight EVP practioner comes along and tells the Keaton charecter that the dead wife is contacting him"from beyond"...Spooky?No,not really,as the overweight guy seems almost a buffon..Later we meet another pretty blonde who believes that chubby-cheeks has made contact with her dead boyfriend..Keaton hears a tape that MAY contain his wife's static-filled voice,and he's hooked..Later he sees tragic episodes before they happen(and claim lives),and finds out that,MAYBE his dead wife is directing him to the scenes of local accidents ,deaths,and worse(again,we are never sure what exactly is going on)..Then the big guy winds up dead,but not before telling the Keaton charecter that there"are a lot of bad people out there"(sort of like in real life)..Keaton fails to prevent the blonde whose boyfriend may have contacted her"from beyond" from falling out of a high-rise apartment(which would have killed you or I but didn't kill her),he goes to an uncompleted high-rise where some missing housewife is being tortured by his employee,is maybe attacked by demons and dies...Oh,sure,there is more to this loopy script,but why bother telling it?I can write a better scarefest than this...Probably so can you..+dvd
triple dip for what reason?+N+This is an awful attempt at nothing but to try and squeeze more money from fans who just flock to the words "limited edition". Save your money. There is no reason to buy these. At all. No DTS, no commentaries. Capitalism at it finest+dvd
I need your help!+N+"I can't review my purchase because I haven't had receiver it yet! I've veen trying to communicate with you by visiting your page on Internet, but I couldn't reach a way.

I liked it...alright 2 and 1/2 stars+N+Let me first start off by saying that Richard Gere is in my opinion a very so, so actor and in this movie, his crazy irish accent bugged me.and seemed forced. But, still, it's a descent movie thanks to Bruce Willis, perfect for the vilain in this movie. Jack Black also makes a short cameo but Bruce makes sure he doesn't stay alive for long.  The movie is basically about a prisoner released from prison to track down a man that only him and his girlfriend can identify.  And then, comes a very average move with some good scenes. all resulting around Bruce Willis. The problem for me is that at times, I wasn't cheering Richard Gere on whatsoever. That could have to do with his acting. On the other hand, Willis is great and very effective and also..very cool. But, what looks like it's going to be a good suspense movie ends out being like all action movies. and that my friend is something I seriously am tired of. Now, that I think of it, I own this movie. You know what that means. Hello Blockbuster+dvd
Pirates of the Caribbean, review by SL.+P+I was sceptical about this movie at first, but I was supricesed how good this movie was. We have sword fighting, romance, pirates, kiddnapping and funny skelletons! It is absolutely a great movie and I truly reconmand it for both young and old.  An amazing great and funny movie with exitmant+dvd
Terrible+N+I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best.   I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time.    Not recommended. +dvd
once again a king story is ruined on film+N+in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!!+dvd
The best dark comedy out there+P+This is simply the best dark comedy out there. The slow dissolve of the Rose's marriage into all out nuclear war is both hilarious and sad to watch. DeVito is brilliant as the narrator and in a secondary part in this movie. There is a continuity error in the movie at the end. When Gavin arrives at the Rose residence it is clearly night, when he comes back with the ladder it is obviously morning+dvd
"Well, I don't like this at all...computers and corpses are a bad mixture."+N+I really had little idea the cinematic pain train I was boarding as I watched Rats - Night of Terror (1983) aka Rats - Notte di terrore last night.  Oh sure, I read the reviews and what not, but to really get a true understanding of the film's utterly rotten essence,  you must watch it, and experience it, for yourself.  I've seen a hell of a lot of bad movies in my time, but I have to say, this fetid, moldering bit if Italian produced flotsam buried the needle on my Suck-O-Meter, something that hasn't happened since I watched Red Serpent (2002), with Michael Paré and Roy Scheider.  Written and directed by Bruno Mattei, the man who gave us such wonders as S.S. Extermination Love Camp (1977) and the ode to the usage of stock footage Hell of the Living Dead (1980), the film features Ottaviano Dell'Acqua (Zombi 3), Geretta Geretta (Demons), Massimo Vanni (Escape from the Bronx), Ann-Gisel Glass (Deadly Eyes), Henry Luciani, and Fausto Lombardi (Don't Look in the Attic).  The film started off well enough, with some displayed text telling us about how a great, nuclear holocaust drove those humans left alive under the ground, where they developed sophisticated societies.  After some years, some (fool) hearty individuals decided on returning to the surface, to enjoy the toxic wonderment I suppose, and became viewed as primitives by those who remained down below.  The story picks up in the year 225 A.B. (After the Bomb) as we see a motorcycle gang tooling around the wasteland (looks like an old rock quarry to me).  As I was wondering just where in the heck they got the gas to run their machines, they boogie on into a dilapidated city, deciding this might be a good place to set up camp...and this is about the time the, as the boys from MST3k would say, the `deep hurting' began as the characters started to actually talk.  Anyway, the find a deserted research facility, complete with canned food, plants (fresh vegetables and fruit), and fresh water, littered with gnawed on corpses...well, it's not completely deserted, as there's the rats, and plenty of them.  They clear out the dead bodies, move into their new digs, and soon enough the mutated, furry, super rodents begin picking off the gang one by one.  Not only that, but the verminous mongrels have eaten up the tires on the vehicles, preventing those who haven't become all ate up from leaving.  As tensions rise, more annoying characters die (thankfully), and leadership of the gang comes into question, but there's little time for debate as the hairy horde begin their relentless onslaught (apparently grungy bikers are good eatin'...who knew?) challenging man's long standing position on the top of the food chain...  Seems pretty straightforward, right?  Well, perhaps, but essentially what I did was put a nice sheen on a stanky (stank goes well beyond stink) turd, and believe me, that was not an easy task...really, the absolute worst aspect of this film is the writing.  Here's an example, once the rats begin killing off the characters, one woman spits out this little gem of brilliance, "The idea of being killed right now really frightens me."  And here's another, as the leader of the gang prepares to flash fry a whole mess of rats with his flamethrower, "I'm going to warm their whiskers."  Oh criminey...the film is filled with completely unnatural dialog, pointless interactions, accompanied by atrocious, awe inspiringly overblown performances.  I swear, the actors chewed up more scenery than the rats themselves.  As far as the characters go, a more irritating bunch you'll rarely see.  One can't help but root for the voracious rodentia.  And get the names of some of these a-holes...Duke, Video, Lucifer, Chocolate...there was one character that was particularly loathsome in that of Myrna, a leather clad woman who spent a great deal of time losing her marbles and screeching incoherently throughout the film.  Here's another juicy line of idiocy, as one mook finds a bottle of booze and begins sucking it down..."Hey, what an incredible drink!"...yeah, drink up boyo, as your time is gonna come.  I think the absolute worst scene for me was near the beginning, when the group found all the food and began celebrating by dumping sugar and flour all over each other, dancing about like mental deficients.  The black woman, named Chocolate (nice), ends up covered in flour, and starts shouting how she's white, while doing a very loose interpretation of an Irish jig.  The effects throughout weren't too bad, but mostly featured people off screen either throwing, or dumping rats onto the performers.  There were a few gruesome bits, like the rat in the sleeping bag gag, and the exploding corpse piñata filled with rodents, so fans of the visceral will find something to enjoy.  Now I've read where some think the awful aspects of the film are intentional in a comedic sense, and even the back of the DVD case makes statements along these lines, but I honestly believe the original intent was to try and make a serious, scary film, and once the finished product was out there, everyone assumed it to be a joke, so Mattei went along with this rather than cop to the fact he's a lousy writer....hell, that's what I would have done, if I were in his Italian loafers...I suppose it doesn't make a difference one way or another, as if you're an aficionado of rotten, sleazy, awful cinema, this one's right up your alley.  As far as the directing, apparently Mattei, who started working on this film right after completing a project with Jess Franco, keeps things moving along, disjointedly, but seems to have thankfully taken few cues from that Spanish hack (seriously, ever seen Oasis of the Zombies?  If so, you know what I'm talking about).  Hey, at least there's a decent nekkid chick in the movie, which is nearly spoiled by a nekkid man and the appearance of his wang dang doodle.  As far as the ending, I did see it coming, and despite the fact it was completely ridiculous, it was suitable for this story.  Anchor Bay Entertainment provides on this DVD a very good-looking, widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic print, along with mediocre Dolby Digital 2.0 audio (some of it was really soft, in terms of the dialog, but perhaps that was for the best given the script).  Special features include a lengthy theatrical trailer, a Bruno Mattei bio, an interview with Mattei titled `Hell Rats of the Living Dead' (9 minutes), and a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art included on an insert, the flipside listing the chapter stops.  Cookieman108  By the way, I think plenty of rats were harmed in the making of this film...also, if you're interested in buying this DVD, I'd suggest doing what I did and buying the Anchor Bay DVD Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which features six films including Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), and Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). It's available here on the Amazon website, at a really good price, and cheaper than buying the individual releases.+dvd
Terrible, but still fun+N+OK, this movie stinks! Now that we have cleared that up, let's take a look at why this movie should be watched. Our story is about a post-apocalyptic world, in which the human race is forced to live undewrground; in order to avoid contact with the radation that has killed life.  As time goes on, two groups of survivors formed and did not get along.  So,  group 1 up and left and made for the Earth's surface again. This is where our movie starts.  The group is a bunch of bikers and look like they came straight out of LA, CA 1980.  As they are settling in, the discover that there is some sort of ultra-smart, ultra-fast, ultra-carnivous species of Rats on Earth and there are large numbers of them.  Very cheesey and not worth more that $9.50 or $10, but definatly worth watching.  And, to all those weiners about these being real rats, get over it!  There is this perfectly legal profession in the UNited States that I'm sure you would call for assistance if you had a rat problem.....We call them exterminators.....what's the difference?+dvd
Horrible Audio!+N+I could not really enjoy the film. I purchased it recently on VHS and the audio quality was horrendous. I don't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio, and it is very annoying to follow. Don't waste $19.95 on it. Watch it on TCM; even there the audio is distorted. I only got it because it is a very early Irene Dunne movie, and I was curious to watch it+dvd
Did I ever tell you about the time I invented snowboarding?+N+Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous "raunch" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.  I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like "This movie is just like Out Cold".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, "Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some "characters" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.  If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire "King of the Mountain" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.   Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the "cut & paste" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.  Grade: ** out of ****+dvd
A great help+P+WOW what a great DVD! I liked the show segmets the best and it was a big help planing our vacation, I never knew that there was so much to do in Las Vegas now. I thought the program flowed well and had a really good chaper index to quickly review the parts we wanted to see again. This looked just like someting you would see on the travel channel+dvd
hardly the noir classic id been led to believe+N+poor ray milland gets caught up in a wacko murder plot and illicit love affair in this overrated film noir from director john farrow, who is best remembered for directing second-rate movies and siring a second-rate actress. even charles laughton is dull here!+dvd
Great Show+P+This is one of the shows I watched when I was younger, its so good to be able to see them again, the bad thing is that it doesnt come with spanish audio+dvd
THIS IS NOT THE MGM VERSION REVIEWED BELOW!+P+This "Robobox" is not the MGM version reviewed below. It doesn't have any of the extras, it's just the movies. Still great movies, though+dvd
Another sequel.....+N+Not much really needs to be said but, I'm sure you are all asking the same question as I am...When is Michael going to die!  I love the original Halloween movies but come on kill him already and end this series before you screw it up anymore.  The same goes for Friday the 13th I mean Jason X with Jason...in space?!  Jason needs to die, Mike Myers needs to die and Freddy Krueger needs to die.  We love the old movies but please stop reviving them somehow just let them die+dvd
Good... for what it is.+P+Titan AE is a really good scifi movie.  It has fantastic visuals, chases, and a good enough story to keep you interested.  The voice acting is also pretty good.  Unfortunately the movie suffers from what many movies, especially in this genre, suffer from.  They don't commit to an adult or child-based audience, nor do that go after strictly a scifi audience or a more general audience.  So what ends up happening is you get just enough of both, without fully focusing on one target audience, kind of sterile, but still good.    If you are looking for mind blowing concepts and something other than 'standard scifi fare' this isn't where to look.  If you want a good movie that keeps you entertained and that the kids can watch too, this is a great flick. +dvd
I'd Give It 100 Stars if i could!+P+This film brought me to tears. Nights of Cabiria is the first film I've seen from this brilliant Italien director. Cabiria is such an enduring character that will always be remembered for her innocence, spunk, and most importantly, her defiant spirit after going through so much humiliation by scumbags who took advantage of her golden heart. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE.+dvd
Desperate Acts+N+I won't give a long drawn out account on why this movie was bad for me, but one thing sticks out in my mind. The characters tried too hard to me. I love Sanna Latham, but it seems like she was forcing herself to convince us that she was really romantically involved with Wesley Snipes. With all the ups and downs of their relationship, I was praying that they just chalk the relationship up as a loss and move on.  After awhile it just get tiring ,you know, like a real relationship.  I much prefer the book. This movie doesn't hold a candle to the book. The book is as real as it gets. Pretty much how things are today+dvd
POWERFULLY COOL HIGH BUDGET OLD SCHOOL ACTION-PACKED Anime!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+A COOL FANTASY ACTION THAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!!!!! Maybe not FAST as Dragon Ball but is SOO HIGH BUDGET!!! I mean... The animation is SUPERB ***** (the moves, destruction and fights were very realistic), the character desing is soo COLORFUL (just as seen in the cover), the graphics are pretty realistic, GOOD story but very simple, bad english dub but not THAT bad, COOL song at the ending credits and the camera moves were AWESOME!!  I said that this anime is like Dragon Ball because there are to many "HADUKENS", jumps that make look like the characters are flying and the story about the bad guy that want the ultimate power to conquer the wolrd but the good guys also can have the ulmate power to protect the world. But this anime is not THAT similar to Dragon Ball.  I like the concept of the characters... I mean... each character have a diferent power, one with a cool spirit sword, other with a power whip, other with "haduken" and the last one with the control of a giant power dragon!!! obiously this anime concentrate more on the action and not much with the story.   I never saw the serie, so I don't care what people say about the comparison to the serie.   P.S: This anime is like PG-13 style or a Saturday Morning Cartoon but don't worry!! you will be SOOO entertained that you won't care.   Adios.  +dvd
AWESOME!!!!+P+I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS A OSCAR WINNER! NOTHING CHANGED BUT THE VOICES!BUT WHO CARES, THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED!I ALSO LOVE THE PLOT. EVEN THOUGH THE BEGINNING WAS BORING. BESIDE THE FACT THAT BOTAN GOT ZAPPED BY LIGHTING!ALSO THAT THEY ADDED MORE CHARACTERS,I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME!OVERALL IT WAS GREAT!!!!+dvd
wow+P+i loved this movie it is great funny the animation war great great for every on+dvd
Jason Robards at his worst.+N+One of the curiosities of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" is that the main character is not "Julius Caesar", who is killed early in the play, nor Marc Antony, who has by far the best and most famous speech - "Friends,Romans, countrymen, ...".     The central character is Brutus, the "noblest Roman of them all", who must balance his his duty toward Rome against his loyalty to Caesar.  Brutus is a follower of the Stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals, rather than being lead by his emotions.  It seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having Jason Robards, a highly skilled actor, deliver all Brutus's lines in a bored flat undertone.  I wonder how they persuaded him to do it?       "Don't act Jason.  Trust us.  Just read the lines off slowly             like you never saw them before and you don't care a pin.     It'll be great.!"     To say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement. Mr. Spock has a wider emotional range.  They would have done better and saved money by having Brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the HAL 9000.  When Brutus is off screen the movie is fine.  Heston is surprisingly good.  Gielgud is great. It is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes, the cheap sets, the worst fake beard in the history of cinema. If you want to see a much better film version, there is the classic black and white version in whcih James Mason and Sir John Gielgud make a superb pair as Brutus and Casius, and  Marlon Brando gives a chilling Antony.  As for this one, if someone gives it to you as a present, by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library+dvd
maybe now haters will appreciate "Darkness Falls"+N+Hunky guys, pretty women, and even scream queen PJ Soles (who is strictly in here just for her name, because she's useless) can't save this one. Using the same exact legend of that was the basis for Darkness Falls, this film gets worse and worse as it moves along, after a really creepy intro.   The acting is terrible, and the bottom line is, the "spirit" of tooth fairy goes around killing people using modern day power equipment, like wood chippers and nail guns. There's nothing scary or atmospheric about it. The only thing it has going for it is a couple of good gore scenes.  Seriously, if you're going to steal an idea from a movie that was panned by critics and horror fans, seems like it would be a snap to make it tens times better.   I'll stick to Darkness Falls and it's creepy atmosphere+dvd
Played more for laughs+P+Unlike Sorcerer Hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot, this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first. My almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before I bought it. There's a lot of familiar voice actors(ADV studio-Andrew Klimko/Sorcerer Hunters-Gateau) & Kelly Manison/S.H.-Big Mama, Martian Successor Nadesico-Haruka, Excel-Great Will of the Macroverse. Japanese actors Tomokazu Seki/M.S.Nadesico-Gai Daigoji, Card Captor Sakura-Toya, X-Kamui & Kotono Mitsushi/Sailor Moon-Usagi, Excel Saga-Excel, Blue Seed-Kome. They even got DBZ's Bulma-Hiromi Tsuru on ep 12) so the whole thing comes off pretty well. I found the plot a bit thin--or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters' clothes off almost every ep, but I did laugh quite a bit+dvd
Such an Interesting Documentary!+P+John Cleese brings his signature brand of humor together with interesting and thought-provoking interviews to create such an interesting mini-series about the face - why is it beautiful (or not)?  What do expressions mean?  Do they mean the same thing to everyone?  Who is the BEST at knowing if people tell the truth - or if they lie?  What would life be like if you couldn't recognize the faces of friends?  Why are facial deformities so "problematic" for societies - is it because of their elevated importance of beauty, or is there a different reason?  This fascinating video will answer all these and more, leave you laughing... and actually make you SMARTER by the time its over.  Support given by the undeniably beautiful and witty Elizabeth Hurley, funny man Michael Palin, and others round out the experience.  I couldn't recommend this movie more+dvd
Good Hong Kong Police Film+P+I would have preferred to have seen this film in it's original Mandarin language track but I do not feel it is necessary to knock this edition.  I also take the unfashionable opinion that "Reservoir Dogs", Quentin Tarantino's homage(not rip-off) to "City on Fire", is the better of the two films.  "Reservoir Dogs" beats this film in terms of style and characterization if not completely original.  That said, this is a highly engaging film.  It has a compelling central premise of a police undercover operative who not only has to fear the crooks he's infiltrating but his superiors who view him with contempt.  There is action here for sure but it doesn't subvert the story.  I recommend this film for any fan of Hong Kong action films but if a Mandarin edition becomes available check that out instead+dvd
The race begins+P+I only began watching the Amazing Race a few years ago, in season six, I believe, so I never saw how the show got its start. This DVD gave me the chance to go back and look at where the Amazing Race began and how far the show has come in the last few years.  The premise behind the Amazing Race is simple. Race around the world and the first team to cross the finish line wins one million dollars. Of course, with prize money like that, it won't be easy navigating your way around the world, but if you succeed, you get the cash.  The race began (and ended) in New York City. Teams traveled through South Africa, China, India, Thailand, France and numerous other places before returning to the United States for the completion of the race. Along the way, eight teams of two were eliminated, leaving only three teams of two in the final leg.  When the 11 teams of two left the starting line, they had no idea where they were going, or what they were doing. They got clues that led them to exotic destinations, places many of them had never been. It was fun to watch these Americans try to get along in another country without speaking the language.  There were some great challenges in the first version of the Amazing Race. Contestants had to jump off a cliff in Africa, navigate a crowded market in India, hike a steep portion of the Great Wall of China, drive a team of dogs in Alaska, soar in a glider above Italy and more. As the years have gone on, the challenges have remained difficult, but I believe that some of the ones in the first season were among the toughest.  Along the way, teams were met with Road Blocks, which were tasks that usually only one member of the team could complete, and Detours, which gave teams the chance to make a choice on which way they wanted to proceed. Often times choices made at Detours could make up valuable time or put a team behind their competitors. Teams also had the chance to use a Fast Forward. The first team to complete each Fast Forward, could skip all tasks on that leg of the race and go directly to the pit stop, which was located at the end of the leg. However, each team could only use one Fast Forward during the race and choosing when to use it was key.  At the end of each leg, contestants would get a 12-hour break at the pit stop, where they could talk with other contestants and just relax and prepare for the next leg. The last team to check in at each leg was eliminated, with the exception of three legs that were non-elimination legs. In future editions, teams were penalized for coming in last at a non-elimination leg, but in the inaugural season, there were no such penalties.  As the seasons have gone on, producers have tweaked the show to make it better. Some of the things in the first season that were changed included the introduction. Host Phil Keoghan would talk about what previously happened on the show and at the end, say 'who will be eliminated tonight.' However, if you listen to that intro, you can tell when nobody's going to be eliminated because he doesn't use those words but others. Now, on the intro, he says 'who will be eliminated next,' which is much better. Also, Phil would only greet the last team, which always was a tip-off to the last place finishers that they were indeed, last. Now, Phil greets every team and that makes it more dramatic for the teams.  The teams in the first season were also much like the teams in every season I've watched. You have the requisite gay couple (Joe and Bill aka Team Guido), the spunky grandparents (Dave and Margaretta), the parent-child team (Nancy and the very cute Emily), the macho guy teams (Drew and Kevin, Rob and Brennan), the underdog two women teams (Pat and Brenda, Kim and Leslie) and a few young couples using the race as a gauge of their relationship (Paul and Amie, Matt and Ana, Lenny and Karen, Frank and Margarita). This formula  has been used on most of the editions I have watched, though, I am not arguing with it. It seems to work. Team Guido was the team everybody loved to hate, thanks to their cockiness and sneakiness. It was tough to watch Frank and Margarita racing to the finish line, thinking they were first, when in reality, that was not the case. My favorite two teams were frat brothers Drew and Kevin and Nancy and Emily. Drew and Kevin were just a riot. They made me laugh at every turn, yelling at each other, but always managing to stay in the race until almost the end. Nancy and Emily made it farther than anyone expected them to, which is always nice to see. They fought through some difficult times, particularly in India, but came through stronger as a team. Plus, Emily was pretty darned cute.  As far as extras go, this set has a lot, but the way they are set up is different. You can watch the episodes with a choice to go look at unaired footage, but you can't see the footage any other place. It would have been nice to package that another way, but it is still nice that it is included. There are four episodes of commentary, two from Rob and Brennan and Team Guido and two from Lenny and Karen and Drew and Kevin. There is also a look back at the first season with the aforementioned teams, Keoghan and the executive producers. There is a look inside the making of the first season and how difficult the logistics were. It is interesting to hear the producers talk about how they were often on the same plane as the contestants and barely steps ahead of them for much of the way.  All told, this is a solid release of the very first season. It would be nice to see more seasons released. Season seven has also been released, but I would love to see seasons two through six as well+dvd
The Emerald Forest+N+This movie was horrible. I am sorry I purchased it. It was like watching an old B movie with a low budget and bad acting. I got the feeling it was strictly a venue for the writer/director to view and film [...].+dvd
Not happy+N+The Movie is great, but the used DVD is garbage. The DVD skips and stutters. I feel like I got taken to he cleaners+dvd
Another great performance by Mark Ruffalo.+P+Overall, this movie was "ok"- it was enhanced by Mark Ruffalo's performance and while I wasn't so fond of the ending, it's still a movie worth your time to see+dvd
Awful+N+I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one+dvd
ITS OFFICIAL - BRAD PITT  CANNOT ACT+N+Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a "  cult classic" ( isnt that  what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? )  or "underated" (theres a reason  it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a  yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody+dvd
The nostalgia is finer than the reality.+N+I bought this out of a desire to reconnect with my childhood.  Blackstar was one of those shows I warmly recall getting up early on saturday mornings to watch.  Having watched the episodes again 25+ years later, I find them a little nostalgic...and more than a little annoying, to be honest.  The music is ultra-cheesy, as are the sound effects, the dialogue, the animation, the characters, and the plot.  On the upside, my five-year old son seems to like them, and there is a sense of satisfaction that he enjoys the same sort of thing I did when I was young.  My advice, buy the DVD for children under the age of 10, but don't buy them for yourself....just cling, cling like mad to your fond childhood memories of the show+dvd
Amazing Cast-Weak Movie+N+Secret Agent was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Christian Bale, and Patricia Arquette among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of an Englishman, living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of London.  Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day...  In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the "magic," meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: "Was that it?" As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.   Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...+dvd
Heavy-Handed and Sluggish Conrad Adaptaion (See 'Sabotage')+N+'Secret Agent' (1996) stars very strong cast -- Bob Hoskins (also ex-producer), Patricia Arquatte, Christian Bale, Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Izzard, and uncredited Robin Williams.  The music score is Philip Glass, and the director is Christopher Hampton, who made 'Carrington' before this one.  So the film should be better than average classic novel adaptaions, which it isn't.  This Conrad adaptation is sluggish, not knowing what it really wants to show.  One great disadventage is that we have seen the adaptation of this Joseph Conrad novel before -- Hitchcock's 'Sabotage' (1936) starring Sylvia Sydney.  (Not to be confused with the same director's film named 'Secret Agent.')  This version, not perfect to be sure, knows what it is doing, for the master of suspence turned it into a spy story with a thrilling sequence about a bomb hidden in a bag carried by an innocent boy.    However, the new version, though it is more faithful to the original novel, and proud of its great cast, has no sense of what it really is doing.  The film opens quite promisingly, with Bob Hoskins' Verloc, a shopkeeper in 1890s London, who actually is a spy in the pay of Russian embassy.  He is summoned by the Russain ambassador (very good Eddie Izzard), who tells Verloc to demolish one symbolic building in Britain with a bomb, the building which represents 'time' (you know where).  So far, interesting.  But as if to imitate the original novelist's slow moving narrative, the film unwisely introduces many flashbacks that tell us the outcomes of the botched plans.  Yes, Conrad uses (intentionally or not, I do not know) the confused narrative that seems to have lost the sense of coherent chronological order (read 'Nostromo').  Hampton not only employs this flashback method once, but twice (!) to show how Mrs. Verloc (miscast Arquatte) meets her fate.  So irritating.   The production designs are excellent, the acting is good all in all -- Jim Broadbent as police inspector and Robin Williams as The Professor around whose body a bomb is strapped are memorable among them -- and Philip Glass provides good socre.  However, all is wasted or misused, and even Glass's music starts to sound repetitious.  The film uses it when there is no need, and that is really annoying.  I like the atmosphere, and I don't think Joseph Conrad is a difficult material to make a film out of it (see 'Victory' made the year before).  But Christopher Hampton as director, though good as screenwriter, seems to have killed the material with heavy-handed direction.  And its characters that should be more interesting with a smooth story, too.           +dvd
Robbed my time+N+Burglar is your typical D movie.  It has more bads than goods.  Actually, it has a ton of bads.  When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't expect Oscar worthy material.  But, I did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest.  I didn't get either of them.  Yes, the acting was all right.  Whoopie Goldberg is a great comedic actress, but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in.  Burglar moved at a snails pace, and that is putting it lightly.  There were way too many coincidences.  There would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around, or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen.  Also, the directing was terrible.  The director did not explain things well at all.  The only reason I stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right.  And of course, I was right.  The plot was paper-thin.  I don't like a movie when I know the ending a quarter into the film.  Overall, Burglar is a definite waste of time that now has the title of &quot;most predictable movie ever.&quot;  1 Sta+dvd
PANTSWETTINGLY FUNNY+P+I gave "The Aristocrats" 1 star, as I thought it was just a pile of disgusting comments,words and images going nowhere. This Pamela Roast is a heap of disgusting comments, words and images DEFINATELY going somewhere - to your funnybone - because it is applied with wit! I don't want to spoil your fun by quoting jokes from the show, but let me just give you an example. Referring to the sextape of Pamela and Tommy, one of the roasters said :" I have not seen a p***y take such a pounding since Clay Aitken lost to Ruben Stuttard". I thought this was a hilarious ROAST, and I regularly show it to friends who then fall about laughing. I also thought Pamela handled it with grace and style, and I admire her immensely for that! If you like adult comedy, you can not go wrong with this DVD+dvd
Interesting Review Of Suppressed Information+P+Commander X is the pseudonym used by a person who is reportedly a former U.S. Government intelligence agent from the NSA who worked in a remote viewing project.  He has distributed a lot of information from alleged personal experiences and insider contacts to provide glimpses of what goes on behind the scenes with ETs, the Global Elite/NWO, mind control, secret technologies, and more.  Probably the best part of this video is X's expressed view that we all are connected to the Creator and don't need any religion to intermediate.  The video shows scenes of the speaker with his face blacked out, interspersed with a variety of video clips, photos, fractal and kaleidoscopic art, metaphysical drawings, and more.  The voice is altered and it's almost a cliche that the speaker is upsetting folks in the government/NWO by sharing what he knows.  Obviously, if information is classified then those who have taken an oath to serve government agencies can be dealt with in unpleasant ways for releasing what they have discovered.  Thus, I think it is unusual for people like X to directly present their findings to the public unless it is being done openly as an approved leak or dissemination of confusing disinfo.  The speaker here is disguised [though it would seem to me that it might not be too hard for the government to identify him and track him down].  He admits that he doesn't have all the answers and seems to be a bit more calm than some other people that have presented their ideas about ETs & NWO topics.  Overall I thought this video was interesting, though I found the organization of images presented to be inadequate at times even while I really liked many of the computer generated fractal, kaleidoscopic, and hypnotic images.  This video seems to present information in a more cogent and up-to-date manner than past Commander X books, so if you liked the books this video should interest you+dvd
"You ARE the weakest link..."+P+This vanilla release concludes the final three episodes of the New Series of Doctor Who. Boom Town is not a fan favorite, but it does have some funny moments. While Bad Wolf and the Parting of the Ways ties the season together, starting by putting the Doctor, Rose and Capt Jack Harkness in Reality Programs in the future. The New Series looks and sounds great. Christopher eccleston makes a great Doctor, and Billie Piper is a surprisingly great fit for his Doc. 'tis a shame Eccly only wanted to do one season+dvd

Super movie for cat lovers+P+DC is great, the neighbors are very nosey, wonderful family movie+dvd
Doesn't even deserve 1 Star+N+The only resemblance Rise to Power has with the original Carlito's Way film is in name and producer Martin Bregman. The success of the original begs for a vivacious, guns-blazing Carlito Brigante prequel. Unfortunately, Martin Bregman decided to bankroll his son as the director. The result was a train wreck of a movie with horrible casting, acting, writing, directing; you name it, Michael Bregman did it... bad. Topping it all off, the plot fails to lead in to the original movie!  The irony of this Michael Bregman is the similarity between him and a character in the movie - Reggie. Given the chance to inherit his older brother's powerful and profitable position, Reggie, at every turn, makes horrible decisions. At times, these decisions are made, seemingly without any sort of reason. In the same way, Michael Bregman's choices for the film are painfully disgraceful to the original Carlito's Way, and to his father...  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  For the love, stay away..+dvd
I had a farm in Africa.....+P+This is one of my all time favorite movies, not just because it is a great romance, but because it is about a woman defining her own destiny, which is a theme I love. The set design and costume design perfectly capture the feeling of early twentieth century. I hate watching 'period' that are ruined by the costume,makeup, and set designers' attempt to make the antique look seem modern, Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightley is a perfect example. This is a great movie, wonderfully told. I cry every time I watch it. Recommended+dvd
Fake Family+N+What do you have?  A family sitting all the time in a perfectly clean house fully dressed and never, ever watching TV.  They never have chores; they never have real problems, and everything is resolved in twenty minutes by a joking father.  Can't stand it+dvd
Kingston trio reunion: a dissapointment+N+I am a long time K.T. fan. I saw this show on PBS years ago so I bought the tape. The show was severly edited(about an hour) and the audio was poor. it is, however, the last chance to see Dave Guard and Roger Gamble,  therefore it is a must+dvd
the way not to do a movie about a t.v. show+N+first they cast a black man as an undercover agent in the wild west where he would never be able to help as they would never let him in most places. remember this was before political correctiness or civil rights. then they turn one of the best villins on t.v. into a racist man missing most of his body. then they add state of the art f/x and think they have a great movie. it's pure trash and gets one star because you can't give no stars. a waste and you should see the t.v. show if you want to see this concept really work well. just not good at all, a mess+dvd
Great Fun, Great Workout!+P+My baby and I just love this DVD.  The dances are simple to learn, but they really burn off the baby fat.  There is a good variety of music which is nice if we're in a particular mood- no excuses for not exercising!  I also like that there are so many songs, giving us something to build up to; my baby and I still can't quite make it through all the dances.  This DVD really makes exercise challenging and fun while bonding with my new baby- exactly what every new mommy needs+dvd
More of the same...+N+Rest Stop is a pretty bad straight to DVD horror flick.  It's the same old "redneck rampage" style serial killer flick.  But the plot is just in shambles and doesn't make much sense.  Only about 20 minutes of this movie is worth seeing.  By the way, you know a movie is bad when Joey Lawrence is the best actor in it.  I'll give it this much... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there+dvd
Could have been worse...+N+Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. *+dvd

Oxford is no Miracle+N+Ok, the cover looks like a clone of Miracle with Kurt Russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it. West looks really young so this is probably a made for tv British film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of West recent critical acclaim on HBO's The Wire and on the success of Disney's Miracle. I didn't finish the movie because I honestly didn't care who won the boat race. Unlike Miracle which keeps you watching despite Russell's wardrobe and great looking toupee, this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast+dvd
Edward D Wood Jr. could make a better film $120 million this cost $120 million WITW???+N+Volcano is an absurd R list movie story that somehow got an A list budget and A list cast to star in it. The pitiful attempt to make a disaster movie is just a horrifying waste of talent and money. I wish this were a comedy instead of a serious movie; it's one of the funniest things I've seen all year. Where are Mike, Crow and Tom Servo when you need them? This is an MST3K movie if there ever was one.  To make Volcano's boring predictable story a chimpanzee probably took the copies of screenplays of other bad disaster movies, cut out the worst scenes and then pasted them together to make the script for this movie. If there are people stupid enough to write this stuff up for real; I don't want to know about them. You must only need a room temperature IQ to be a screenwriter and make the big bucks. Schoolteachers who put in 12-15 hour days struggle to make a living and the writer of this screenplay drives a Bentley. Shows you how fair life is. According to this movie, there's a live volcano in the middle of Los Angeles. Fault lines the seismologists know about, but somehow they miss a Volcano in the middle of an ENTIRE CITY. Holding this wafer thin plot together are the cardstock disaster movie cliché characters who spout cliché lines. Tommy Lee Jones (Fresh off his Oscar win, shows you how many good roles those worthless gold statues get you.) is an overworked Los Angeles Fireman who wants to just go on vacation when the catastrophe starts. Yeah, there is one of these guys in every one of these disaster movies. The dialogue spouted in this movie will have you in stitches. Every line is a ridiculous cliché and sounds extremely ridiculous. Oh yeah Anne Hecht is the blonde pretty geologist who knows all about volcanoes and schools the audience. She also has an interest in Tommy Lee. Don Cheadle is the guy who sits in an office and banters with Jones over the radio. There's the teenage daughter who constantly is getting herself in the path of danger. Keith David is the cop who does get to go outside and bark orders.  This film is a laugh riot. Badly computer generated lava threatens to destroy all those beautiful California landmarks. In one scene a guy is walking down a hot tunnel and his Nikes are melting; the poor guy gets engulfed in hundred thousand-degree lava and doesn't scream in agonizing pain. He's making a noble sacrifice saving lives. Everything leads up to the demolition of a brand-new office tower to cap the flow of the Volcano. Tommy Lee Jones goes to save the teenage girl from a collapsing building, that's UNDERNEATH THE LAVA and comes out alive. At the end of the movie enjoy the "Volcanic ash" that snows down in sunny California makes everyone look the same. Bleech.  I read somewhere the studio spent $120 million on to make this dreck. Instead of spending all that money to make this movie, they should have paid the screenwriter twice that much to disappear and buried this screenplay deep under the La Brea Tar pits so it could never be made into a movie. But hiding this vile story there would probably lead to the tar pits vomiting up lava in the middle of LA. just like the movie.   I've seen my share of bad movies and over the past ten years Hollywood somehow continues to make films WORSE than Edward D. Wood Jr could ever think of putting on celluloid in his lifetime. Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda had a more cohesive plot and better acting than Volcano.  Unless you're looking for a movie to roast at your MST3K party at your house avoid this on-screen disaster.+dvd
Am I missing something?+N+I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast+dvd
Not as good as it could be!+N+This is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie.  The main character's hair is short, then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long, then the next day it is short again.  When one person gets buried in the graveyard, it is located downhill by the water.  When another person gets buried in the same graveyard, it is up on top of a hill.  It is very hard to concentrate on the plot, characters, etc. when this is happening all the time.  But two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary+dvd
I have to go with an A for Effort.+P+I've had this movie since it was first released and yes I laughed at various parts of the movie when the CGI just was so painfully obvious bad.  And yes I could rip the movie apart just like you can rip any big budget Hollywood production apart, but here was a movie that did their best to stay true to Well's story.  If you are a lover of the Book then I believe this is a must see movie, now if you can get over the movies flaws and enjoy it's content.... that I leave to you and I relly hope you can cuase they get an A for Effort from me.+dvd
Okay+N+I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion+dvd
Worst concert DVD I own.+N+I own about 40 various concert DVD's and must say this is about the worst  of the lot. The reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable. I can't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every 1 or 2 seconds (you get 3 seconds if your lucky) but that's they way they put this together. I actually counted the number of changes over the course of 1 minute during the performance of Jet and it was 51. 51 camera changes in 60 seconds of footage - you do the math on that.  It's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent. Paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy. In the end it doesn't matter as it's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it+dvd
More Than 5 Stars !!!!!!+P+John Denver at his best. Every song from his heart. See John at the piano and a string section backing him up as he sings For You. I am a professional classical musician;however,this is my 'special' DVD for calm,peace and beauty. Sure miss that voice and smile. This would make a wonderful gift or add to your collection+dvd
borderline watchable.+N+kinda bored...the script needs more sharpening and concentration. except the major role aidan quinn, other casts were a poor cast job expecially the cast of geoge washington. i failed to feel any emotion during the viewing and should blame the outcome to its screenplay writer+dvd
Jon-a-than, Jon-a-than, Jon-a-than............+P+The year is 2018 and there is no war and no crime. Corporations have taken the place of governments and the masses are entertained through a sport of modern-day gladiators on skates and speeding motorcycles where only the strongest may someday retire in peace.  Though released in 1975, Rollerball has stood the test of time due to the forward-thinking of the writers within the sci-fi/sports realms and using the setting to describe the age-old conflict of the individual versus a corrupt society.  Jonathan E - played by James Caan - is becoming bigger than the game and it is strongly suggested to him by Energy Corporation Executive Bartholomew - John Houseman - that he should retire. Jonathan E cannot bring himself to abandon his teammates & leave the game - a retirement party finds the superstar not following his script - which leads to a match that degenerates into a vicious life & death struggle to be the last player standing.  The game is already brutal enough before the last game - played on a track, with the object to place a metal ball into a cylinder to score points - as teams named for major cities actually compete for corporations.   The action sequences are brilliant and the drama of the last game is chilling. And that contest ultimately brings - on the track, at least -  victory without a real winner.       +dvd
This should have been a story of human triumph...+N+The film is well crafted, but I do take issue with the racial tones of the storyline. Stop making 'race' an excuse.   People get out of life what they put into it. This should have been a story of human triumph instead of some run of the mill sociopolitical statement. There is waay too much of this happening today.  My appologies to the production crew, but 1 out of 5 stars is all this movie deserves.      +dvd
Good start turns out to be a very poor slasher+N+Only Michael Ironside performance is worth watching. Linda Purl and William Shatner plus the lead nurse should all have been fired for their telentless performances. This movie is a waste of a good premise, less bad mugging performances more gore and suspense would have made for a better slasher movie. Avoid unless you like wasting money, so many better slasher movies than Visiting Hours. Terminal Choice is a far better example of a hospital based slasher, why could'nt Anchor Bay release that instead +dvd
My fave equestrain movie+P+I saw this move about 5 years ago for the first time. I bought it as soon as I saw it on DVD. IT is such a great story and it's content as far as the eventing world goes is almost entirely accurate. It really should be rated more of a pg13 b/c of the language and some sexual content. It still is so worth buying.+dvd
A colorful yet disappointing attempt to capture Doyle's idea+N+The color and CGI's are excellent in this film. The location shots are great, and the attempt to capture the late 1880's successful.  However, the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude,  language and appearance. While this might be the 90's, and women should be  able to handle strong lead characters, this woman, who was the financial  backer of the expedition, was disgusting.  There have been several major  cinematic attempts at this story, but this version leaves a lot to be  desired+dvd
Do not buy this DVD+N+I bought this supposed to be UNRATED version of this movie from "mediathrill" and I felt that they cheated. They have cut all good scenes from this movie. I contacted them and they just denied their responsibility. I had seen this movie earlier, so I was very much aware of all the scenes.  Please do not buy this DVD...no matter what.+dvd
Done me wrong!+N+I recently purchased this movie after seeing in the past on cinemax. I bought this after seeing it was listed as unrated and directors cut, which I thought was cool it sounded great. Now unless the director is a prude this is were I was done wrong. On cinemax they showed a hell of alot more than on this DVD. This had so much heavy editing that I felt so wronged in my purchase. If anyone else feels the same join the club. The movie had some hot scenes, but after watching this version I lost the interest real quick. The movie should have at least 3 to 4 stars for its sex and nudity, but I felt wronged. The only thing I could think of is that someone messed up and put the pg-13 version in my box+dvd
Brilliant; brilliant; brilliant.+P+Where this ranks in the Woody Allen opus, according to those who know, I wouldn't care to say; but for me it's the tops, up with The Purple Rose of Cairo. This is an incredibly witty and delightful work, impeccably crafted in every direction. It is deeply subtle and philosophical: there is nothing shallow about its satire. It is also extremely funny. I laughed a lot, a very lot. Maybe that supremely flat, deadpan humour, sustained to the nth degree, particularly appeals to an English sensibility. The ingenuity and accuracy of the antique filming and acting styles, and the staging of the musical numbers is astounding. Incidentally, that wasn't really Hitler at the rally, with Zelig behind him, was it? I thought that was the Hollywood version of the Zelig life story: the versions merged --- the documentary became fiction, and vice versa. Eudora's mother stole the show.  +dvd
effective gothic style horror(just my opinion)+P+i thought this is a really creepy movie and very hard to watch.it is filled with an air of dread and depression,but i managed to get through it.the last time i tried to watch it,i had to stop watching after 15 minutes.Louise Fletcher is terrifying as the wicked and evil grandmother.i thought the movie was very effective in the horror dept.it doesn't go into as much depth as the book,but i think that would require at least a 2 part mini series.i wouldn't recommend it if you are feeling down.also,if you are a fan of the book,keep in mind that they left alot out of the movie.other than that,i would recommend it,especially if you like gothic style horror,which is what i think this movie is.for me,"Flowers in the attic gets a 3.5/+dvd
Kick Toguro's @$$!!!!+P+In these final ephisodes of the Dark Tournament Heiya beats Bui.  Kowabarra defeats ederly Toguro. Now Yusuke enraged at Toguro for killing Genkei faces off with the evil demon. The fight is intense and to our hope our young hero wins! Toguro is killed by Yusukes powerful SPIRIT GUN!! I love this show, it totally rocks, there is only one faul that i might add; why doesnt Heiya of Kurama get a girl? They should fall for SOMEBODY! I mean they are my two #1 characters. Yusuke gets kakoe so give Heiya and Kurama someone PLEASE!!!Gotta go bye+dvd
A riveting documentary+P+I am not a fan of Russian culture or history, but when I saw this program on the History Channel, my fingers never picked up the remote control. I never channel-surfed once. There was more drama, intrigue, action, and violence in this documentary about REAL PEOPLE than in any soap opera drama. It reminded me that nothing imagined on TV or in the movies can compare with real people and events in history+dvd
Yet another gutter scraping lack of quality in lesbian film!+N+Wake up lesbians: THIS IS NOTHING LIKE Brokeback Mountain!!  To begin with, the differences between this and Brokeback Mountain are too many to list.  Brokeback Mountain contained some of the best acting (by Heath Ledger especially) in many years; the acting in this movie was absolutely horrible.  The cinematography was fantastic in BBM, this looked like it was done by children.  The dialogue in BBM was utterly brilliant; this had to have been written by someone with no imagination or connection to effective or real communication.  BBM was a beautiful, honest, real love story told with unequaled poignancy; this told the dark story of how lesbians find death a better answer than just living a happy, productive life like most of us do.    Whoever thought this to be even remotely good is a victim of accepting the crap that is tossed out there rendering ridiculous depictions of lesbians and lesbian life.  UGH, and suicide???  NEXT TOPIC!  Just because a film has a low budget doesn't necessarily mean low quality!  This is a far too typical stinker of a lesbian film made as an excuse to show girls kissing and show yet another SKEWED image of how we live.   +dvd
The Batman+P+I am going to give The Batman, Season 3,  a rating of 4 stars, based primarily on the continuing improvement seen in seasons one and two with respect to certain aspects of the original Batman-The Animated Series, but downgraded from the five star seasons one and two, due to increasing reliance on Robin and Batgirl.  Because of the obvious confusion in the series titles, I will refer to the Batman animated series from the 1990's as Batman-The Animated Series and I will refer to the current one as The Batman.    I own and have viewed all four editions of the original 1990's animated classic, Batman--The Animated Series and like many, at first I was somewhat put off by The Batman's new animation style.    Batman-The Animated Series was groundbreaking in many ways and had an original look and feel.  Nevertheless, this new version grows on you and there is much of value here, indeed, some things here are even superior to Batman-The Animated Series.  The animation style here has overtones of the Japanese anime style but nowhere near as much as has been incorporated into the Cartoon Network's Teen Titans, whose look I detest.  In fact, given the tragedies of the look of the Teen Titans and the recent computer animations done of the Fantastic Four on the Cartoon Network, and Spider-man on MTV, The Batman looks traditional and sensational by comparison.    Furthermore, for me, the Batman in Batman-The Animated Series was drawn too much with a brawny Space Ghost/Gothic look, inspired by Frank Miller and the first Batman movie from 1989.  The costume in Batman-The Animated Series returned to the original Batman costume with all dark tones, from the 1940's.    If you are in your 30's or 40's as I am, this is not what the Batman that we grew up with looked like.  The 1970's Batman generally was leaner and more athletic looking, and had the costume that I prefer, with the round yellow bat insignia.  The Batman retains this classic 1970's look.  The premise of The Batman is that this is the Batman in his early years of crimefighting, and accounting for his youth, I believe that the overall look here is more consistent with the way Batman was drawn in the 70's by Adams, Giordano, Rogers and others, perhaps in order to fit more with the new Batman of the movie, Batman Begins.    At least in the first two seasons of The Batman, this Batman is both a loner who works by himself, and a vigilante sought by the police.  I find this more realistic than having, as in Batman-The Animated Series, the Police essentially deputize Batman and having Batman fight crime with child sidekicks--although Robin and Batgirl are to come in this series as well.  The other thing that I am beginning to really like about this series is the fresh look at many of the villains that it is taking.  The Joker is still recognizably the Joker--I asked my three-year-old sons to verify this--but he has a different and bizarre look.  The same is truth for many of the other stalwarts:  the Riddler, the Penguin, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, etc.  Like its predecessor, The Batman continues with the annoying trait of far too many Joker episodes--really, can't they improve security at Arkham Asylum at all?--as well as too many of the other before-mentioned villains who are beginning to become a bit tired.  I would prefer to see more of the lesser-used villains like Ras and the Scarecrow.  It does, however, have some excellent episodes involving Killer Croc, Man-Bat, and Solomon Grundy and another involving the Bane defeat of Batman.  Hopefully, we will continue to see more of these lesser known but more interesting opponents.  One thing that I have never really understood about DC is their general refusal to use famous comic book story arcs in their movies and cartoons.  When it is done, as with the Ras story from Batman-The Animated Series, the results can be excellent.  Marvel does this much more often, to great success but DC seems to almost always try new and inferior stories.    Overall, I find The Batman less stilted and more in line with the classic DC Comics Batman of the 70's, in terms of tone, darkness and style, compared with the more self-important, taciturn and somewhat bland Batman in Batman-The Animated Series.   The reason that I only give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the creators are currently going down the same road as their predecessors at the Animated Series and that means that the episodes are incorporating more and more Robin, which is arguable on the merits, and more and more of Batgirl, which is not arguable on the merits and is apt to ruin the series.  Batgirl was never an essential part of the Batman comic, unlike Robin and her inclusion here is lamentable.  I have heard the DC creative talent say that anytime you do a Batman show, that you get two years to do it right and then the suits at Warner Brothers come over and start asking, "where's Robin?--where's Batgirl?--we need the youth market."  The first two years I would give 5 stars to each.  Time will tell where this series goes from here.  In my opinion, the first two seasons of The Batman were the best comic book adaptation currently going, with the possible exception of the Justice League, which is now out of production.  I am hoping that the future of The Batman has some more famous comic book story arcs involving Ras, Scarecrow, or Man-Bat, but I fear that lots of the Joker, Penguin and Batgirl are in the offing. Time will tell. If you are a traditional Batman fan, I wholeheartedly recommend seasons one and two and the third season, somewhat less+dvd
Extrodinary+P+This is by far one of the best workouts I have ever done.  I love it because its not too strenuous but you still get a good workout.  There is no jumping around, you dont need  a lot of space and Leslie has a good attitude and great energy.  This is well worth the money!+dvd
One of the worse in a while-not enough camp to make it fun.+N+If a movie is going to be really bad, it should have some camp value added in: i.e. real humor of some kind, some excitement and unexpected events, and some good hammy dialog. This groaner has almost none of these things, at least to my understanding. I did watch this two times over the years, once in the theatre, and another buying this tape for 99 cents. I really do like most science fiction films I've seen in the last 40 years, including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films. So I am qualified to submit an opinion. Lost is Space does have some entertainment value for kids. It is just OK, if you can turn down your IQ rather drastically and lower expectations also. I was able to do both a little the second time, and enjoyed it somewhat. In the theatre, I ended up walking out before the ending. This is the only time I have done this because of a movie. (One other time I did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes, but that is another story.) Both times I saw this, the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game, and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start? The problem is, it never does. Saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who don't have enough to support their arguments, but in this case it is very true. Nearly every twist and turn of this story (there are a lot for such a bad movie), causes the story to worsen. So by the end, when the story has no ending, one really doesn't care at all. Knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe+dvd
Elizabeth Hurley topless is all this movie has going for it. +N+The only reason why I think this "movie" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.  Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.  Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.  It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.  Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet+dvd
One for the garbage can...+N+If you are a Blackmore fan stay away from this piece of crap because during the guitar solos all you will see is Gillan shaking his butt or "playing" the congas and everybody else except, of course, the guitar work. I couldn't bear it anymore in the middle of Child in Time and will certainly not check the rest of this mess. On another level, I am just appaled by the extremely poor musicianship of Jon Lord! This guy just Stinks so bad that even I could take him on the Hammond; I'm a guitarist by trade. Heck, even Blackmore is very ordinary from what I've se...heard. Can't say anything about Glover because you can't hear what he's playing. So the only high points of this video, as far as I could stand it, is Ian Paice's performance which is excellent as usual and Gillan's incredible voice. A very sad thing because DP was my favorite band and one of the major reasons I took up the guitar in '69. I can certainly live with the bad sound and picture considering the time that the show took place but absolutely not the crappy playing. This one is NO keeper and I simply threw it away, but if you really want to see DP at it's best go for the Concerto For Group and Orchestra DVD, with the Royal Symphony Orchestra, but there again you won't see much of Blackmore's work but the musicianship is way better+dvd
WHY?+N+What were they trying to do?  I mean c'mon either they were stupid and bought a crappy camera and got really really bad actors, and they try to remake some of the scenes, oh my god.  This movie sucks its at the bottom of my movie list. I rather lick the seat of a toilet in a public bathroom than watch this movie again. It is nothing I repeat NOTHING compared to the awsome american hit classic movie Maximum Overdrive ***** 5 STARS, OH YEAH!!+dvd
Entertaining but not authoritative+N+The two stars are for the entertainment value of this series. There's no doubt that Penn and Teller can put on a show. However, this series proves very little. They employ the same techniques they blast as B.S. to make their points: questionable "experts", misdirection, and even petty name calling. I have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are B.S., but to say that Penn and Teller "prove" them wrong is stretching it. If you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility, watch this series. If you want to see well thought-out, unbiased skepticism, this isn't it.+dvd
The Demonic Genius of the Artist+P+Bruno Nuytten's film on the life and times of Camille Claudel (Isabelle Adjani) and her mentor/lover Auguste Rodin (Gerard Depardieu.)  A well directed film that follows the female artist's humble beginnings as Rodin's assistant and lover to her later achievements as a great sculptress and artist.  The film focuses on Camille's development as a character rather than being a shallow biographical film of her work.  The film explores her relationship with Rodin and how his infidelities led her to feel used and abandoned.  The film shows how her parting with Rodin opened the doors of her creativity and talent as a sculptress in her own right.  The film closely associates her genius as an artist with her mental disintegration until she is confined to a mental asylum in the later part of her life.  This is a great film and both Adjani and Depardieu play their roles very well.  The film is a careful psychological study of both artists and what inspired their talents in making such great works of art.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in art, history, or just good drama+dvd
A very enjoyable performance of a lesser known opera+P+Although there are no show stopping arias that the viewer will remember, the music is very pleasant and full of melody, and the performance is excellent. If you are looking to broaden your collection to include more than the standard operas such as Boheme, Aida, etc, this light comedy is a very good choice. Not only do the singers sing and act their parts well, but they also look their parts (which is frequently not the case in opera)+dvd
Comedic One Minute, Insulting the Next+N+I never thought movie criminals could be dumber than the ones in "Dead Presidents," but the kidnapping-for-drug-money plan in this movie was absolutely worse. As soon as I saw where this movie was going, I just shook my head and watched the idiots go (I'm talking about the characters--not the REAL actors). This movie was pretty silly to me. Timberlake was an absolutely terrible thug, and two people had forewarned me of this, but I figured I'd see for myself. Every time I heard him curse and glanced at his tattoos, I laughed louder. His friends were even more entertaining; a bunch of suburban kids who thought being kidnapped was cool; a guy so high out of his mind that he didn't realize up from down; and the ransom kid who was so excited to be in a "criminal" scene that he completely seemed to forget he was in danger. I don't know where the movie stores will put this one when it comes out on sale, but it really should go into the comedy section. The scene where they go "buddy, buddy, buddy" made my stomach hurt from laughing at that goofiness. I'm sure that'll be copied off of in high schools everywhere. The thing is that the actual plot of the story (with different actors and without the druggies) would've been great; but the people who played the roles were absolutely so out of touch to the point where it looked like I was watching a Vanilla Ice video, or something close to it.  I would've given it more stars if the movie was meant to be a parody on drug dealing, but from the previews, it sounds like the company was going for a drama.    Cons: I could've gone without hearing the constant racial slurs in this movie. It annoys me when people of the culture say it; so it definitely annoyed the hell out of me to hear several characters use certain words. I didn't find that at all funny.+dvd
JEANNE CRAIN IS PINKY!+P+While I would have preferred Dorothy Dandridge or Lena Horne to have payed the titled lead in this interracial romance,produced any released by Fox in 1949, Jeanne Crain does an excellent job of portraying "Pinky" Johnson,a Mississippi "colored" girl,who up north(boston) "passes" for white and falls in love with white doctor William Lundigan,who does a fine job,in a not realized role.3 Ethel Waters as Pinkys' granmother and Ethel Barrymore as a family friend do excellent work as do Frederick O' Neal,Nina Mae McKinney,in smaller, but important roles.3 Elia Kazen,not one of my favorites,for a number of reasons,directed after John Ford was taken ill(actually fired?) and had to leave the production,Kazen did not care for Jeannes' performance.Dudley Nichols(fired because he would not change his downbeat ending) and Phillip Dunne(How Green Was My Valley) wrote the screenplay. I don't like to use the term "colored",but thats' how Pinky is repeattedly referred to in the film.Maybe 4 and 1/2 stars is a better rating,also Jeanne and both Ethels received AA nominations+dvd
Bad Movie But DVD Is Improved+N+This Batman movie is one of the worst Batman movies.  Although The movie suffers from a super silly feel, I still think it might be better than the melodramatic Batman Begins.  Val Kilmar is the worst Batman ever.  Not bad special effects in this 90's movie.  The Batman franchise died with this movie.  The only two good batman movies are Batman and Batman Returns.  Although this movie stinks, it has good special features.  Music videos, making of docs, interviews, dleted scenes: it has all the works.  I would pick it up only if you are a huge Batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise I would just save my money+dvd
For kids of all ages+P+Don Knotts is a classic. As hokey as this movie may be, it is great for the whole family. It brought back some of my youth, (not a lot, but some).The use of the live action and animation was well done. The DVD quality was excellent.+dvd
Dont bother buying it+N+If you like crummy productions with scarred and silicone filled breasts, buy it.  If you want to see real yoga adepts doing real yoga - this aint it!  The women couldn't do Tai Chi or yoga if their life depended on it.  A real hilarious video, buy it if you feel depressed and want to laugh real hard..+dvd
Honor Blackman?  No, the EXQUISITE Honor Blackman!+P+Watching Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale makes one thing clear: I was born a half-century too late.  Why can't I find a girl like that?  Anyway, this set of early Avengers episodes is really most valuable (to me) because it's the genesis of the Cathy Gale years, which is where the Avengers begin for me.  The episodes are certainly crude compared to later episodes during the Emma Peel years, but they nonetheless possess their own raw power that the more polished shows somehow lacked.  The lack of retakes gives the acting a rough, natural edge that serves the more serious (by Avengers standards) scripts quite well.    For fans of the later, more famous Avengers episodes, these early shows can serve as both an embellishment of the Avengers' quirky sense of adventure and a counterpoint to the more whimsical nature of latter years.  Recommended+dvd
Great Movie+P+I just love Thailand!!!  I've been to all the locations the movie was shot at, which gives it that much more appeal and familiarity! A star gets taken away for the obvious movie mistakes. When will they learn machine guns DO NOT have unlimited rounds, and they are not double action and click multiple times after the rounds have finished. An M16 expends its 30rd mag in less than 2 secs at full auto - same for the AK-47. The amount of violence was superb+dvd
The best part is watching the cliches fight for dominance+N+This movie goes way off the unintentional comedy scale.  A rag-tag group of survivors, containing every possible patented Hollywood character, from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all WASP and the fiesty token minority, are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the Poseidon Adventure look like Citizen Kane.  My favorite part of this film is the invincible dog.  You can always tell a Hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog, which always survives everything and is, gosh, just so darn *cute* that you're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits.  A classic example is the golden retriever in Independence Day that, in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening, somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed Los Angeles..and of course just at the last moment.  A cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here, where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant, but is just flat out funny.  It's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people, but you've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device+dvd
woow+P+coverdale and all the others... thank you so much... you took me back to 23 years ago when I was a student in the university... there were no compact disc those days... i used listen you guys my cassette player over and over and over.... the best concert song "ain`t no love in the heart of the city"...+dvd
Style over substance+N+This DVD is the perfect example of misjudged style over substance. The concert is well shot in high definition, the direction is slick and the performance is very professional, but the overall experience leaves me absolutely cold. Compare this to something like the  wonderful Deep Purple at the California Jam DVD, which has grainy video and sound from an original mono recording, and you will see that with all the fantastic technical advances in the world, style can never overcome substance.  And ultimately, this particular Whitesnake incarnation seems to offer very little in the way of substance. The band members themselves are indisputably technically gifted musicians - but you just can't help feel that all they effectively are is a band of hired-hands who learned their craft from watching MTV in the early 80's. This is no doubt unfair and I am sure they are very nice chaps, but in this setting they just come across as extras supporting Coverdale, in the same way as Miss Kitaen and the Jag did in 1987.  As for David Coverdale, this is painful...no...excruciating to watch.   I have long been of the opinion that this man possesses the greatest voice in the whole of popular music - never mind just rock. When singing in the right register, David Coverdale has the most wonderfully rich, soulful and charismatic voice to ever grace a rock, blues or soul song. And to be fair to Coverdale, it's not as if he has lost that beautiful rich timbre, it can still be evidenced on his last solon album, Into The Light, and indeed sounds as good as ever in the setting of some of the mellower songs.  The problem Coverdale has is that he cannot sing heavy rock any more....at least not in the high pitched manner he so often attempts on this DVD. He sounds absolutely dreadful I am sorry to say. It's very sad in a way that is similar to witnessing the sorry sight of someone who has lost a limb. In Coverdale's case, it is the voice that has been amputated, and it's just awful to witness his Donald Duck like efforts at out screeching Robert Plant.  Unfortunately this seems to be the direction David feels he has to go in in order to maximize his earning potential. His moves back towards integrity, evidenced on Restless Heart and Into The Light, were not commercially successful and now he seems to believe that the hair metal brand of Whitesnake, born in the late `80's, is the way to go. Judging by the delirious fans on this DVD, he may be right - at least from a financial perspective. He sounds dreadful, and surrounds himself with a cloned band of metal heroes, but at least he's satisfying the dwindling band of supporters who once made his 1987 album a multimillion seller the world over.  Integrity seems to be a bloody luxury Coverdale can no longer afford.+dvd
funny+P+i don't understand a lot of the criticism of the yes men by other reviewers. i mean, all the right-wing reviews are to be expected ("flaming" is what amazon's user reviews are all about isn't it?!). so, obviously, that's a given.  but all the 2 and 3 star people who were like "i didn't find it funny" and "too much talking" and what not, that's what i don't get.  i found the movie terribly funny. even the benign banter whilst driving around or prepping i found funny. but the scene where they present in "the suit"... man, i was almost crying it was so funny.  and as for the "what's the point!?" criticisms, all i can say is: by that logic, what's the point of anything? i mean, what do you want? it's a movie? the best it can hope for is to inspire the viewer. in this case either to act, or to possibly feel like there is a little bit of hope in the world since the only audience to challenge their right-wing, lassie fare, free-unmitigated-trade-to-the-max insanity are the college kids (aka the future policy makers), and because the one time they present the more positive ideas of the left, their audience of economists (who you'd expect to hate it) all express such joy at someone finally taking a stand for what they know to be right, but never get to talk about. if this is the gauge by which you judge success or failure of what a film should do, i think it succeeds admirably.  in short, i thought the yes men was very funny. on netflix (where *accurate* star ratings are helpful, not silly ones, like in this venue), i gave it 4 stars. i gave it 5 here because i want to try to offset some of the 1 star people+dvd
Losers' Row+N+It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a shambling, preoccupied air of sensitivity could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossally misguided effort, was able to get the job. Sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. If the film looks horribly amateurish, that's because it is.   If there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein: the debasement of culture. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.  Many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other, older (and better) films. Some actually liked these clunky "comments" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them pointless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself, any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief.   In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility, but a paucity of invention, the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were virtually nonexistent, and screenwriter David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and `thought' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the studio brass, the producers, and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye, Baby, bye-bye.   As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the Lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality, and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them. The film was doomed the day he was hired, and a very funny and original book by Gore Vidal became the jerky, manic, and supremely unfunny (except when it wasn't trying to be) Myra Breckinridge, The Meltdown.+dvd
Care bears movie II: New Generation+N+There was a flaw on the DVD. It would get to a point and stop. It was a gift and 30 days would have passed before it could be returned+dvd
Don't Waste Your Money+N+Even though this movie had good actors in it, I would not recommend it.  I especially was turned off by the language and I'm sorry to say this ended up in my trash and this was a first for me to do that+dvd
Heavy riffs and Gravity defying solos can't make up for Slash"s uptight acting!+N+PLOT: Slash gets mad at axle and goes on a murderous killing spree. Then he does some pretty intense guitar solos. SOLOS:5 STAR ACTING:1 STAR   RECOMMENED: ANYTHING WITH BURT RENOLD+dvd
The Bar Song+P+Enough has been said about this movie already, I think, considering its overall flimsiness. It really is "ironic" fun, as someone mentioned, and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it. I thought it was pretty amusing. It helps if you're into sailing and sunny ports. Be that as it may, I am surprised that no one has commented on the "theme" song. It features quite prominently in the beginning, introducing us to the two English lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy Gibraltar sailor dive; and towards the end of the film, it introduces the final twist... with a vengeance. As it turned out to my delight, "You're leaving me" -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called "Porque te vas" by Jose Luis Perales, one of my favorite Spanish singer-songwriters. Great song, really! Silly performance, though. I'm almost a bit curious what JLP got out of it..+dvd
Another King Masterpiece Butchered+N+I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better.+dvd

A Sultry Femme Fatale, Entertaining Plot, but No Depth.+P+"Dead Reckoning" is a story told half in flashback by Captain Rip Murdock (Humphrey Bogart), a paratrooper just returned from combat in World War II. In the Southern town of Gulf City, Murdock is beaten up and on the run. Eluding his pursuers, he enters a church and tells his story to a priest so that, whatever may come, someone will know: A few days before, Murdock and a paratrooper under his command, Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince), were whisked home from Paris and put on a train to Washington, D.C., where Sgt. Drake was to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. But Drake took off while the train was stopped, and Murdock set out to find him. He followed Drake to Gulf City, where he discovered that Drake was a fugitive before he enlisted, having confessed to the murder of his girlfriend's husband. Murdock finds the girlfriend, Coral Chandler (Lizabeth Scott), in a nightclub owned by a man named Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky), who has a mysterious hold over Coral.   "Dead Reckoning" is entertaining but not thematically sophisticated. The dialogue is fine, but not clever or sharp. The character writing is superficial. This isn't top-tier film noir, but it does have Humphrey Bogart's charisma and Lizabeth Scott's sultry voice and great looks. Coral Chandler is one of the most manipulative femme fatales in film noir. In fact, she is the center of the film's only discernible theme: You can't trust women. I've rarely seen a film with such an overt anti-female premise. Normally I find femme fatales to be a refreshingly unsentimental image of women. But Murdock is relentless in proclaiming women to be deceitful and castigating Coral. -And he falls under her spell anyway. So it's all very amusing. "Dead Reckoning" isn't a great film, but it's solid entertainment with high-power stars.  The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2002): The print of the film is good, but not restored. There are some small white specks, but not enough to be distracting. Bonus features include "The Bogart Collection" (4 minutes), which is scrolling text about Bogart's career followed by some posters of his films. "Vintage Advertising" is 3 posters for the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean+dvd
Stinks to high heaven !!!!!+N+This so called director should be sued. As a 30 something who loved the original every friday night from season 1 through 4 (before Coy and Vance).....Coy and Vance look like gods compared to the cast of blasphemous characters to a classic and timeless show. First off....why was Burt Reynolds and not Danny De Vito casted as Boss Hogg? Why not Chevy Chase instead of an overweight villain known for playing a violent middleaged nut in "Breakdown" and "Conair"...(MC Gainey)...MC... you are a very good actor in your niche...just not turning James Best's character upside down. I refused to see this in theaters and rented in (regrettably) even after hearing the derogatory reviews with an open mind.I can write a book about character mistakes and ruining the "originals"....but I'll end it by saying the following to quote "You took the name of a classic to sucker fans and boost ticket sales for what would have been a straight to video bomb if it was not titled "Dukes of Hazzard."+dvd
Pure Poppycock+N+Single mom moves with her 2 daughters to an isolated property up in the mountains that she recently inherited.  There, they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century. While the acting is somewhat decent (and the only feature of merit in this flick) everything else screams - GENERIC.  Poorly paced, poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you've seen before.  Sadly, i've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the Sci-fi channel with more appeal then this.  Definitely feel free to skip this film in the After Dark collection+dvd
A fine cast of actors, wasted.+N+After watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of "Hamlet" it was easy to see where all the money went: to the cast members.  The cast is loaded with potential.  It includes Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Christian Bale, a youthful looking Kate Beckinsale (she has come a long, long way since this film), and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask, "What other movie did I see that actor in?"  But the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise.  For much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times.  It has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing, royalty that, if not for the crowns they wore, would be indistinguishable from the common herd, and some very predictable and flawed direction. The followers of the king, peasantry included, number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village.  The director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story, which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of Masterpiece Theater shot in the countryside.  One scene has Hamlet dashing from a buring hall, sword in hand, but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing; cut to the following scene of Hamlet confronting the new king, his murderous uncle, and the sword reappears in his hand.  That kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable.  The acting ranges from good to passable, but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns.  Except for the sighting of a schoolgirl version of Kate Beckinsale, prim and proper as all young lasses tend to be, this film is sadly a waste of time and money.   +dvd
Highly Effective Low Budget Chiller With Great Atmosphere and Scary Zombie Characters+P+The 1977 horror effort "Shock Waves", has been a film I have long wanted to see. After my first screening of it I can say it most definately proves the adage that a film need not necessarily have a big budget to be highly effective in creating great atmosphere with heaps of tension and sheer horror. It's story should prove irresistable to any horror lover with the visual image of sinister waterlogged Nazi Zombies rising out of their watery graves to terrorise unsuspecting holiday makers trapped on an island with a scarred former SS commander almost a guarantee of a tension filled viewing experience. I most certainly found it that way and was really surprised by just how effective this little effort was in creating just the right eerie effect. Hopping on the undead zombie bandwagon "Shock Waves", actually manages to rise above many of the cliches of this genrre which was so popular in the 1970's. Aided as it is by some truly superb under water photography, a creepy musical score which is highly effective in creating the great sense of unease and a really interesting cast including legendary horror greats Peter Cushing and John Carradine, and former child star Luke Halpin, "Shock Waves", has all the right ingredients for a highly enjoyable and at times quite disturbing horror story.  Partially based on the novel "The Morning of the Magicians", the story opens with a dishevelled and disoriented young girl (Brooke Adams) being rescued from a dingy and it is her recollections of the horrific incidents she has just experienced told in flashback that make up the story. It seems she and a small group of holiday makers have taken a tour on a rundown old boat captained by a crusty old salt (John Carradine) a nd his young assistant Keith (Luke Halpin). After experiencing some strange weather changes and what appear like underwater disturbances the ship collides in the middle of the night with a strange vessel that literally appears out of nowhere and doesn't appear to have a crew. Sustaining damage the tour boat runs a ground just off the beach of a strange island. When the captain mysteriously disappears Keith takes the other passengers ashore in the dingy where they not only find the captain's body but also find that the island is deserted except for a mysterious German gentleman (Peter Cushing), who lives alone in an old hotel. It turns out he is a former SS Commander of the Nazi army who has fled to the island at the end of World War II and he warns the trespassers to leave the island immediately. As it turns out he has his own secret in that he was in charge of a daring experiemnt by the German High Command near the end of the war which saw the creation of a secret group of storm troopers called the Death Corps who were underwater breathing zombified killing machines designed to be unstoppable in battle and totally without mercy. Unfortunately the underwater disturbances have upset the death corps watery grave in the hull of the boat that the Commander had sunk them in after fleeing to the area at the end of the war and very soon they are coming ashore picking off one member of the group after another. The SS Commander himself becomes their victim and soon it is only Keith and Rose (Brooke Adams) who are left and attempt to make their escape from the sadistic zombie killers. Keith however doesn't make it after fighting off the death corp members as they attacked the dingy just as they thought they were clear of danger and then it is just Rose as the sole survivor who drifts away in the dingy awaiting to be rescued.   "Shock Waves" which had a highly effective working title of "Death Corps", was the brain child of independant filmmaker Ken Wiederhorn who was also the film's writer/director and he along with producer Reuben Trane managed to work wonders on a very meagre budget of $300,000. Obtaining the services of horror greats John Carradine and Peter Cushing was a definite plus and gave this low budget effort a status it might not have otherwise enjoyed. Not much time is given towards deep character development as is usually the case in these type of efforts however both these acting greats make the most of their smallish parts. Peter Cushing in particular delivers his usual polished performance playing another variation on his Nazi characterisation complete with hideous scar right down his face. He manages in a very short screen time to really create interest in his character and as to how a Nazi SS Commander happened to end up on this island all alone. Performances by the rest of the cast are uniformily ok with younger members Luke Halpin who is still best remembered for his role in the highly successful television series "Flipper", and Brooke Adams in her major film debut being th emost prominent and doing good work in the face of the zombie onslaught. The really memorable participants in the story of course are the extremely sinister "death corps" or zombies that arise from the bottom of the ocean and begin an indiscriminate killing spree among those trapped on the island. Their horrid appearance once again is a bit of a miracle considering the films low budget and it's amazing how their google covered eyes, Nazi uniforms, and blank unfeeling expressions give them a truly frightening appearance. The scenes of them slowly emerging from the water and creeping up behind some of the cast members are truly inspired pieces of filmmaking and go a long way to increasing the fear element in the story. A major plus in "Shock Waves", considering that alot of the action takes place near water or actually in it, is the superb underwater photography by Irving Pare. His work here is excellent in firstly depicting the old submerged wreck that is home to the long dormant death corps and in the chilling shots of the zombies rising up and moving off along the ocean floor heading towards land . The location used in Florida for the site of the island despite only being a few miles from greater Miami has a suitably isolated feel to it and the sets used, whether they be the abandoned old hotel or the marshy swamps, possess a strange other worldly feel to them that really removes the story and the viewers from anything safe or identifiable.  "Shock Waves", although certainly no great horror classic is a most interestign effort that is now a firm part of my horror film library. It probably would be impossible to create such a film as "Shock Waves", nowadays with such a low budget and be still able to include the performers, photgraphy and locations that it does. My only regret is that horror greats Peter Cushing and John Carradine who are both great favourites of mine didn't get to have a bigger involvement in the story and actually share some screen time together. Cushing's character in particular is a most interesting one which deserved to have been explored more however that is a minor qualm and the overall product is excellent and essential viewing for anyone who has a fascination for "zombie" oriented stories or horror efforts in general. Enjoy! +dvd
doesn't live up to the hype+N+After seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release, I was intrigued, mainly because it didn't have any of the usual '70s black action stars (Fred Williamson, Richard Roundtree, et al) in it. I though maybe this was  The Great Lost Blaxploitation Film. I was wrong. It's just not that great.  It's got a good plot and good intentions, but a mediocre script, some  remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity (even for this genre)  and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads (who struggle  valiantly but in vain) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-TV movie.  Sorry, folks, it just doesn't live up to the hype+dvd
Wonderful nostalgia trip+P+I originally saw this movie when I was 10 years old and  over the years remembered the wonderful dancing and songs.  I was disappointed that it never seemed to turn up on TV and was delighted to be able to buy my own copy.  When I saw it again recently it was even better than I had remembered it.  Donald O'Connor's partnership with Vera-Ellen is enchanting - I've watched their dances over and over.  And Ethel Merman lights up the screen every time she is on - her interpretation of the memorable Berlin songs, whether belted out or sweetly romantic - is, I believe, unbeatable.  I now want to get all the other Merman movies.  And what a shame that George Sanders' deep, rich baritone  wasn't more widely heard. +dvd
Could've been great!+N+I found this movie to be awful! The pace could've been kicked up, enabling the movie to flow together more cohesively. The scenes seemed to be disjointed, one minute here, the next minute there, but it didn't alleviate the drag of the story line. While it did capture the feel of the NFL, the uniforms, the people working on the sidelines, the coaches etc. the movie floundered when it attempted to get an important point across. This could've been put together so much better+dvd
A Differnt Bat+P+This show just works. Solid character development and interaction, catchy tunes (the opener is fantastic), a new dark tech world of Gotham and it stays true to the history established in Batman: TAS.  But what really works is how differnt it is from Batman in comics, movies, and the cartoons that began before it. Terry (the new Batman) who is still in high school becomes Batman though to Bruce he is still somewhat a sidekick like Robin or Batgirl. Really that comment doesn't describe the role Terry plays. I can best describe him as a cross between Batman, Robin, and Spider-Man (young high school version) he's dark and seeks revenge like Batman, young, adventurous and very intuitive like Robin and helpful, responsible but also often taking on too much as Spider-Man would. There is also the dynamic of family, nonexistant in previous Batman animated adventures, he has to hide what he is really doing as Batman from his friends, family and girlfriend, reminding me of Peter Parker's relationship with Mary and Aunt May.  Villains are differnt too, I'm glad the creators didn't just rehash enemies from the other series, though a few carry over, we don't deal with a "Mad Hatter Beyond" or "Penguin Beyond", not that either are bad characters.  Again this series works, I have been waiting for years for this show to appear on DVD. Nothing and No one can replace Batman, but Terry and this show provides a new hero that takes the name and theme of Batman with a differnt approach+dvd
Party Line Dances DVD+P+This was a great video. In the past, I had bought some videos from other sources and also checked a bunch out from the library and most were not very good. They were out of date or did not have the kind of dancing we do around here. But Shawn's dance DVD was very up to date. It has the type of dancing that we often do  in my location (Florida) and at the LDS church dances I attend.+dvd
Another Mel Brooks masterpiece+P+I include this in my "must have" collection of comedies.  Sure the humor is stupid, silly and not politically correct but it's just funnier than anything made since+dvd
Apathy For The Sake Of Apathy+N+***CONTAINS SPOILERS***  It's probably fun to make a movie about yourself -- or one that focuses closely on you -- and that is what director Solondz has done with STORYTELLING. Not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments, it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director (Paul Giamatti, THE ILLUSIONIST) who is obviously a doppelganger of Solondz himself.   Overflowing with apathy, Storytelling has two distinct parts: "fiction" and "nonfiction." In fiction, which launches the film, we're introduced to Vi (Selma Blair, HELLBOY), a young New Jersey college student involved in a writing/literature class that concentrates on critique. Her boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, THE WIRE TV series) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls. The teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom, also from THE WIRE), a Pulitzer Prize winner who's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class. But apathy attracts apathy in Solondz story, so Vi and Mr. Scott have a sexual encounter, if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another. There's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here, but it quickly dissolves.   Perhaps "fiction" was part nonfiction, too, as one could easily see Solondz sitting in a class, reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques.   The second and final portion of Storytelling is "nonfiction." Here we find Toby Oxman (Giamatti), a man who can't seem to finish anything. But when he discovers a young kid named Scooby (Mark Webber, THE MEMORY THIEF) who mirrors Toby's own apathy toward life, the wannabe film maker believes he's found a new calling: to make a documentary about society. John Goodman (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) stars as Scooby's father, a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family. His wife Fern (July Hagerty, AIRPLANE) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast, but hides it behind a facade of smiles. The only empathetic character in the Webber household is the maid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, TORTILLA HEAVEN) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life. Toby Oxman films all of the Webber household people but keeps his focus on Scooby, whom he sees strictly as a character subject.   That the film ends abruptly with the death of Scooby's family, and we still see no emotional response from him, only adds to the viewer's anger that there's no one in the film to care about. No protagonist that we can get behind. No angst from any of the characters. They are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways.  Directing a movie about apathy has been done before; AMERICAN BEAUTY is probably the most notable of these. But the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them. Here in Storytelling, the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy+dvd
What a crap!+N+Looks great but don't get trusted, this is the worst killer shark film ever! The shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like 4 people and that's it. So please don't see this movie I'm warning you+dvd
Great fun+P+Good heavens, where do they get these 'essential' Amazon reviews anyway? Sheesh. Nothing like a good dose of pomposity to motivate a reply. This movie isn't supposed to be taken remotely seriously, please. It's a goof--and a very skillful one. Sure, the plot's a mismash of twice-reheated devices, the baddies are about as subtle as week-old meat, and to watch at all requires you suspend enough disbelief to reconsider the Easter Bunny as gospel. So what? You don't go to movies like Lethal Weapon for the depth of characterization. Yes, a bit helps, but... not too much. Same holds true here. It's easy to ridicule--but it's easier to enjoy.  Movies like Long Kiss Goodnight are made or broken by virtue of their scriptwriting, and the script for LKG can more than hold its head up alongside other genre staples. A good script determines how willing an audience is not only to watch a movie--but rewatch it. (And buy it, for that matter.) Long Kiss Goodnight offeres a lot of pleasure in this department, it's got more quoteable lines than Die Hard and--yeah, let's be frank: the lead's hotter. (A perhaps more up-to-date comparison for tone would be Speed.)  The crux of the arguments over the film's virtues, however, is & I suspect will remain whether you buy--or want to buy into--the idea of doing this kind of film as a girl-thing in the first place. (Like anyone questions the validity of the premises behind James Bond movies? Come on. This is really very simple: if you enjoy films where women kick @**, you'll very likely enjoy this. If the mere idea makes your lips purse with disapproval, skip it & move on.) Not to mention--what better place to subvert expectations than at the movies?  Though the script may be better than usual, what really sells the film is Davis & Jackson--they have killer chemistry. Their scenes are filled with some terrific lines, but more than that, it's about delivery; they parry quips and insults with a good-natured banter that goes beyond making even the implausible character of Samantha almost believable: it's just plain fun watching two actors at the top of their game play off each other. No reason to turn up one's nose at A-grade actors in B-grade movies; I seem to recall some truckers-in-space thing years ago... Alien, was it?  The movie loses a bit of momentum towards the end when it makes a feeble pass at Message, but that's easy to shrug off--the editing's otherwise tight and the pace is just what it should be, fast with breathing spots. The special effects work. Because the film's pretty retro in terms of plot & setting it generally hasn't dated much, and the buddy-twist here is a much-needed change from the usual guyfests. Last, the soundtrack is excellent, I'm always amazed when a wise choice can bring something like She's Not There back from the dead. The only shame is that the album soundtrack lacks a lot of the best selections from the film, which demonstrates much taste in southern blues.  Finally: Ok, yes. That thing with the shot glass? too cool+dvd
no draft dodger here!+N+John Wayne was no draft dodger as one of the previous reviewer(moron) stated:  As Wikipedia states:  Wayne was 34 when the U.S. entered the war and was raising four children, and when he requested deferment he was granted a 3-A deferment for family reasons. Later in the war his deferment was changed to a 2-A deferment with the explanation that having him serve was not in the national interest. Despite not serving, Wayne did support the military through participation in USO shows for U.S. servicemen.  I guess it would have been better if we had let the government take care of his children if he would have perished in WWII?  My grandfather also didn't server in WWII because he had three children to raise including my father.+dvd
More Average Episodes From the Worst Season!  The Birth of the Highlander!+P+Having reached this stage of the 3rd and final season of Classic Trek, I find myself wishing someone would put this dying horse to sleep out of mercy.  It was truly heart-wrenching for this fan of TOS to have to make myself watch through the entire 3rd season with its many ups and far too many more downs while remembering the great acting, scriptwriting and overall quality of the first two seasons and here in what would be the 3rd last volume of the 3rd season, we get two average quality episodes.  For the first episode, "The Way to Eden", one has to put the episode and hence the story into the context of the times i.e. 1969.  Obviously, taken in today's context the episode is ridiculously bad but for an audience in 1969, the plot has deep meaning what with the civil rights movement and the growing dissension against the Vietnam War, that audience could definitely relate to this parable of those very troubling events of their time.  Viewed from that context, I think this is actually not too bad an episode which tries to show the points of view of the various parties involved: the demonstrators (Adam and the rest), the sympathisers (Spock) and the non-sympathisers (Scott and Kirk).  I thought taken as an overall episode, this metaphor of the major civil demonstrations of the late 60's was very good.  The moral is that one should fight for what is right but one should also beware of being made a tool for someone else's agenda who may not have as pure an intention as you.  So why do I still rate this average?  Because, I too didn't like the far too frequent outbreaks of pop ditties ala Love or The Zombies that Adam breaks into.  Still, an average episode overall.  For the second episode, there were some pluses and some minuses as well.  The plot that sounds a lot like the idea from which the whole "Highlander" series came about is a good one but what I don't understand is why Daly's character becomes jealous of Kirk and an android!  Also, just because a man is immortal why does that automatically make him have to be the greatest geniuses of history?  This is why the "Highlander" series that this episode spawned is far more believable for me; that individual was just a normal immortal trying hard to suppress his immortality to avoid persecution and not Einstein or Newton or my Grandpa.  Still, for giving us the whole "Highlander" premise, this makes it to the average category of me.  Overall, this volume falls under the "nice to have but not essential" category if you are deciding which volumes to keep+dvd
Chilling documentary of corporations altering the foods we eat at the genetic level... Horrifying!+P+It has never been legal or ethical to own forms of life by patent until corporations began altering the foods we eat at the genetic level. Chilling documentary. Unappetizing display of greed run amok+dvd
Love Ain't No Hepburn!+P+Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's. It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography. Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise. I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes+dvd
GEORGE REEVES STILL FLYING ABOVE THE REST+P+THE 2ND INSTALLMENT OF THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE 1ST SEASON. IF YOU LIKE THE OLD DAYS WHEN LIFE WAS MUCH SIMPLER, START COLLECTING THIS ENTIRE SERIES. GREAT FEATURES, INTERVIEWS, CRISP, BRIGHT PICTURE IN GLORIOUS B&W+dvd
STUNNING!+P+I will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all.   This is a stunning collection of the early work of the `boys` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives. Several of the titles in the series, have until fairly recently, been considered lost forever.   Each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc (again recently discovered) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack.   Even for those who don`t normally view `silent` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen.   Each disc deserves five stars for content, quality and value.  +dvd
Disappointing. Wasted Potential.+N+I love Indy films and try to support them whenever I can.  I heard about this film after it showed at an Indy fest in New York.  The reviews I read were good, so when it was released on DVD I bought it.  Now, I am selling it.  This film was very disappointing as it raised provocative issues, but basically glossed over them.  The racial issues in the restaurant weren't thoroughly explored.  Also, the character development of the workers was lacking. Interesting characters were introduced but never fully developed. The director and writer seemed to be going for the sappy, PC slant and that ruined what could have been a thought provoking, honest view of the complexity of racial issues in modern society.  Another thing worth noting is that several scenes and lines of dialogue were edited out [deleted] from the DVD version of this film.  The extras include deleted scenes but not the specific scenes of which I am speaking.  One of the main reasons I purchased the DVD was because of the scene between Chris [Brody] and Leslie [Hill], but several lines of that scene were deleted.  The director's commentary even states that they wanted to make the theme more human and less black and white or racial.  It is obvious that this was their intent and it ruined the film.  The final scene is just plain lame.  The director stated that ending a film is the hardest thing to do and he proved it!  There were some scenes/lines, but too few to recommend this film+dvd
Sweet Romp+P+&quot;Monkey Business&quot; looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock &amp; enjoy+dvd
Excellent series, horrible DVD+P+I thuroughly enjoyed this series when it aired way back when, and it has, if anything, improved over the years. Outstanding acting and performances, as well as superb writing that the Hollywood can't seem to craft. I have nothing but praise for this series.  The DVD authors, however, have much to answer for. Absolutely no effort has been made to clean up the video during transfer. Some of the footage is absolutely dirty (and that from someone who usually doesn't notice audio or video glitches). What imbecile put a 5-minute advertisement for the company's other DVD offerings and disables the "skip" and "menu" functions. THe only way to get past these advertisements is to play them at whatever fast-forward speed your DVD player has. Special features are not worth mentioning, and subtitles are non-existant+dvd

STOP THE HATIN REVIEWERS/Give it where its due+P+I personally thought that Stomp the Yard was a great Movie Everything about it was great. It so sad to see that people can never give credit where it due. Stomp the Yard was a good movie i mean what more could you expect from the title.  It did remind you of other movies like Drumline, You got Searved and Maybe even Step up but you cant look at those and expect to get the same thing out of it  or even talk bad on because it wasnt what you WANTED to be. To me the movie touched in to a little bit of everything romance, talent history,college and being new to something and showing what you got and also made a point about learning lessons.    As far as the comment from Betty Burks I disagree with everything that was said because all of it was negative My advice would be to grow up and get up to dated we are no longer living in the old days so there was no need to compare the movie to people you felt like have already done things that ewere done in the movie. And the statment about Violence come on where was that at I really missed that part and if I didnt and wasnt Violence in the movie to state that comment itjust showed how some kids with talent react to certain situations A nick name is something that sticks with you and matches your personality or appearance if you didnt have one.....that just explains you The dances were more of a updated version of the latest dances The Telescope comment wasnt called for amd and the noise you heard that was so loud was called Surround sound its located in practically all Movie theater Please Find Something positive out of it atleast I give the movie 10starts its a Must see film GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!! *********+dvd
(yawn)+N+Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Not unlike watching the hundred hour previews before the Oscars or SuperBowl... lots of glitter, much pomp, much applause (especially for old favorites)and a couple of good bits.  Best taken in small doses+dvd
His Short Brilliant Career+P+This is the Hollywood biography of `Buddy Holly', Charles Hardin Holley of Lubbock Texas. The film opens on a roller skating rink in 1956. The band played "rockabilly" instead of the usual "country and western" music, reflecting the changing tastes. Then Buddy played "That'll Be the Day" (based on a character in the film "The Searchers"). Some complain. There is a funny scene where a minister denounces this music - in 1956. [Bill Haley and his Comets had a national hit in 1954, then came Elvis in 1955.] The radio station owner had to listen to his sponsors; certain sample records could not be played. A talent scout invited them to audition in Nashville. Buddy had arranged his music for a 3-man band, minimizing costs. But this seems novel, and his band did not meet the company's needs.  New York is looking for "new sounds" that will attract customers. Buddy Holly's "Crickets" have that sound. A station in Buffalo NY played their record continuously. Teenagers bought his records for his new sound, a high-energy music that reflected 1950s America. Buddy Holly wanted to be the producer in charge, a change from the usual business practices. [There seems to be some kind of joke about the racial identity of this group, not true at the time.] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino appealed to white audiences, a symbol of changing times. But legal actions put an end to some careers, and Elvis was drafted. But the toothpaste was out of the tube and nothing was the same afterwards.  The film shows the overdubbing to create an echo effect, first pioneered by Les Paul for vocals [To recreate this for live audiences, another hidden singer was used.] Buddy said goodbye to Peggy Sue and hello to Maria Elena. It shows the Crickets at an Alan Freed "Rock and Roll" show in Brooklyn. Eddie Cochrane covered a song by Jerry Lee Lewis. [Eddie Cochrane died young in a 1959 car crash.] But Jesse and Ray Bob long to return to their home in Lubbock, even if they might miss the Ed Sullivan show. Buddy convinces them to stay and perform. After they leave, Buddy keeps his word and lets them keep the "Crickets" name.  The manager explains the need to personally tour to sell records. A personal appearance sells  more records, customers buy them like souvenirs. It would be a five week Winter Tour of the Mid-West. So the business needs win out. The ending has the show in Clear Lake Iowa. Disk jockey J.P. Richardson talks his famous "Chantilly Lace". Buddy sings to an adoring audience. His "True Love Ways" used violins and other instruments. Buddy's sudden death in February 1959 shocked teen-age America. Some admirers in England used an insect name for their group, but their talents were greater still.  If Buddy had lived, he could be singing today in Branson or Las Vegas. Would he have moved on in the late 1960s, like the Beatles? Or died prematurely by misadventure like Elvis? "Of all the words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: it might have been."+dvd
Good Biopic+P+Preety decent movie based on the life of Buddy Holly,don't know how much is true,there might be some exaggerations,but hey no biography is 100% fact.......what is fact is he put out a lot of catchy hits in the span of 2 years,before he got killed in a private plane crash at 22 years old that also claimed the lives of pop stars Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson in February 1959......good biopic,not sappy and stands the test of time+dvd
A Passover Sedar that's anything but ordinary+P+You know it's going to be a bad day when you need two boxes of matzah on the night of the first seder. Sure enough, a family's biggest problems come to light during the Passover seder as they try to get through the "world's fastest Passover seder," which turns out anything but. Instead of rock 'n roll, prepare for sex, drugs and zany antics of the Jewish kind.  Ira and Peggy Stuckman (Michael Lerner and Lesley Ann Warren) head the diverse blended family consisting of a son addicted to drugs and Dad thinks he cured him; a yuppie-turned-Hassidic son who won't work with Dad in his Christmas ornament business; a daughter who is a sex therapist and Dad knows it; a daughter who is a lesbian from Ira's first marriage; and an autistic son. Bring together a family like that, and you know it's not going to be an ordinary or speedy seder.  Ira and his father Artur (Jack Klugman) lost most of their family during the Holocaust. Grandpa is still angry with Ira for not going into the family haberdasher business and makes him feel like the least favorite despite of being the only surviving child. Still, Ira urges his Hassidic son to go into the Christmas ornament business.  Out of respect for her recently turned Hassidic son, Peggy hires Rafi, a tough-looking Israeli with an eye patch, to build the tent so the family can hold a seder like the old days complete with pillows and lamb roasting on a spit. Before the seder begins, the drug addict fetches antacid for Dad and adds Ecstasy to give him a different perspective. That's only the beginning of the family's journey as Dad starts seeing things including Moses and starts believing he, like Moses, must lead the family out of darkness into the promised land of acceptance and forgiveness.  Though a spoof-style comedy, the story intertwines humanity and lessons without an overdose of sweetness. The family gathering can easily be seen as a Thanksgiving gathering, a Christmas dinner or any other family get-together where members clash over who they are and what they want others to be.    When Do We Eat? rolls humor, quirkiness, Jewish traditions, inspiration, spirituality and a dysfunctional family into a 90-minute funfest. Don't expect it to be the funniest movie ever. If you're OK with Jewish and drug humor, prepare for a good time as the movie contains plenty of laugh-a-lot moments and plenty of witty and animated dialogue.  Extras: not captioned or subtitled+dvd

I'm a Mamet fan, but this is probably his worst.+N+I gave this movie every chance, but the story is slow, the acting is liveless (Ameche is the only one half-way decent), and the story turns out pointless. The ending doesn't really make any sense or have any impact, and the vagueness and indirection that is usually explained at some later point in Mamet's films is never clarified here. Only watch if you're a die-hard Mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party, "Yes, I saw that one, and I agree it was bad"+dvd
Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion+N+First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake.  Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm.  That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?"  This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism+dvd
Great Drama for Trekkies and non-believers alike+P+Like the recent revival of the Ford Thunderbird, the Enterprise Season 3 DVD set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful. The video quality is fine, sound is rich, and the extras are good, but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series, like Freaks and Geeks, without the high price. (Through a series of fortunate events, I got my copy at a discount.)  I don't consider myself a big Star Trek fan. Most of the shows set in the Trek universe work so hard to be "Star Trek" that much of the life is gone from them. My immediate attraction to Enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows-- for example, "comic relief" is blissfully absent here. The goofy humor of Star Trek: The Next Generation never appealed to me. Fox Mulder's dry wise cracking on The X Files? Funny stuff! Commander Data trying to be Sherlock Holmes? Not so much.   Season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories. (Wow, there are aliens trying to destroy the Enterprise with a time bomb! Oh, it was only a dream.) Threatened with TV extinction, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman (who wrote many of season 2's episodes themselves) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging Trek formula. All kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored, characters gained dimension, and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in  Enterprise's 22nd.   In season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera (wowie zowie phasers, stunts, and great production design) and the ideas of real speculative fiction (cloning, dimensional shifts, and temporal manipulation). Ruminations on loneliness, loss, and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama. (Curiously, religion is absent.) At the same time, Archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling. Few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as "Star Trek: Enterprise-- the Complete Third Season.+dvd
"Best Show Ever"? ON WHAT PLANET?+N+So now we have the female version of"OZ"..."OZ"of course was the american cable soap opera show about a bunch of notorious scum,which treated these losers in such a way as to make thier rotten lives,twisted morality and worthless goals palatable..Of course the"critics"loved this show,but then again the"critics"seem to love anything that is not decent,or made for the mainstream audience...This is why the"People's Choice"awards differ so greatly from the other "professionals-only"awards shows,like the oscars.."Bad girls"is merely an"OZ"retread,only this time around the losers are females...The plots are much the same..the same sort of bottom-feeder losers,only this time they have jiggle...The same sort of rotten lives,the same sort of twisted goals,the same worthlessness of charecter...Most of the charecters in both "OZ" and "Bad Girls"ought to be put to death rather than glorified on a teevee series.."Oz" and this garbage are poster examples of why there ought to be a death penalty that is universal and immediate upon conviction...One can only wonder what bottom of the barrel group our"entertainment"industry will glorify next?Maybe some enterprising,and perverted,mind out there is even now writing the pilot script for "A year with Adolf,Eva,Goebbels,Himmler,the concentration camps & you",in which the nazis are seen as just plain folks,misunderstood in thier race-baiting and thier mass exterminations...Why not?Every other bottom-feeder group seems to be getting a cable soap opera show that seeks to portray them in other than realistic terms,so why not the Nazis?And after the nazis,can the inquisition,or the Armenian genocide be far behind+dvd
What a movie!!!+P+It is a long as same as excellent!!! If you like an action this one is for you!!!+dvd
Operation Thunderball+P+After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be.  The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.  What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have.  This film has always been a favourite with diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. I met a very young couple this summer at the beach club. I happened to mention James Bond. These two half my age immediately said, "Thunderball!" Do you like "Thunderball?" I replied, "Absolutely. And by the way I see you are drinking Red Stripe Beer. Did you know that when Bond tosses Quarrel into those corrugated cartons in DR. NO those are cases of Red Stripe Beer?" And so I met some new Bond fans.  As for the DVD, I liked the fact that they re-mastered the film in stereo, but it somehow is too overbearing in spots. I also liked the end titles on the British version much better with the original music that Barry had scored for this sequence. All that being said, I still always liked this film.+dvd
Watch this if there's nothing good on tv+N+I Love Trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions. It is effectively a vehicle for everyone's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s, Julia Roberts, to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by Nick Nolte.  Nolte plays Peter Brackett, a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected Chicago Chronicle.  Ever the ladies man, Brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts, his loyal readers, and even his grumpy editor. He manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time, every time (even if it does mean plagiarising himself!). Having just released a novel, Brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit, and life is looking good for this charming, yet slightly sleazy bachelor. This is of course until journalistic competition, in the form of the lovely Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), comes along with her quick wit, sharpened pencil, keen nose for a story, and obligatory short skirt. In the end, this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably 30 minutes too late in arriving. The actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads, which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clichéd one-liners. There are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story, some wide enough to fit Julia Roberts' smile through sideways, and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios. If it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s, it failed miserably. +dvd
A Misfire from the 60s+N+Although bold for its time, this film is nothing more than a rather unimaginative 1964 politically charged western.  Apart from the novel idea of using the generic gung-ho western style of the day to advance a civil rights theme, this film is simply plagued with an unimaginative screenplay, poor direction, a script full of cliches, and terrible acting.  A small town of Yankees is angered by the return of former confederate Matt Weaver (George Segal) and decides to hire a gunman.  Jules Gaspard d'Estaing (Brynner), a creole from Louisianna, is hired to do the job but he is soon found to be a man of conscience and principle.  It so happens that the Yankees are the biggots and the southerner the victim with the colored man as the conscience of the film.  A predictable love affair also springs up in a vain attempt to relieve the audience from its boredom.  This is simply a terrible film with cliched dialogues and situations juxtaposed solely to make a blunt political statement as to diversity, equality, and justice.  Yul Brynner is the only good actor in this film and even his performance suffers as a result of this simply atrocious production.  This film hasn't aged well and its subtle attempts at addressing the prevalent social issues of its day are as novel and moving as a Sidney Poitier film.  This film is just too antiquated and poorly conceived to be worth owning or even watching.+dvd

Watch your step!+N+I too was misled by these reviews, and I too am puzzled by the apparently sincere expressions of enthusiasm for this movie.    Maybe you have to be Italian or Lithuanian, but I watch a lot of real Italian movies (the ones with subtitles), and they are not like this.    I think that Dreyfus's character was inconsistent.  He acted like a sleaze, and then he acted like a great guy, totally sincere, etc.  Then he acted like a sleaze, flattering people, snowing them with gifts, etc.  I simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he couldn't bring off.    Similarly with the movie as a whole.  This is not simply a feel-good family, although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family.  There needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such.  Something was missing.    Also, the story went nowhere.  There was no plot, and very little story, and it lasted a long, long time.  And the movie had nothing else to offer a viewer.    I would say, be very, very careful before buying this movie.  I don't think it was overlooked.  I think it was looked at and turned down.+dvd
Dreadful+N+I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched.  Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings.  Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up.  But it makes a nice coaster, though+dvd
Did It Backwards-Ordered Diva-Read Reviews-Canceled order+N+Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon+dvd
Really grows on you+P+I consider myself Goth, even though I generally have to keep it hidden.  I only mention this because I expected to Really LOVE this immediately!  I was disappointed when I didn't fall for it right off the bat, but I did myself a supreme favor by watching it again. This is a jewel and has a lot to offer, but the caveat is that it might not be instantly accessible.  That's good, though, right?? Who wants the same rehashed stuff over and over?    My initial disappointments were, first, that the music wasn't "belly dance traditional" and in some cases not even belly dance at all, but it was just an expectations problem.  The music on this DVD ranges from modern Arabic percussion/synth/vocal and modern ethnic/ modern bellydance to modern urban/ modern urban bellydance and Techno.   My second disappointment was that the dancers' movements were unexpectedly slow, so that after the first 2 or 3 pieces I was so bored that I started fast-forwarding and then gave up completely. It turned out I needed a bit of time to "recalibrate" myself! When I purchased this DVD, I had never seen Rachel Brice or Sharon Kihara perform yet, and did not know anything about the Tribal style or what to expect from Goth bellydancing.  If you are looking for strictly bellydancing, you should know that I would label 10 of the 20 pieces such.  I would label 6 as a blend of belly and modern, 3 as strictly modern, and 1 as a pretty worthless music video trashy piece.  Some specifics:  Ariellah is very engaging and talented, very enjoyable to watch, with excellent taste in costuming.  Her pieces are my favorites.  I also enjoyed Asharah's dances and costumes.  She is talented and only slightly less engaging than Ariellah.  Ayshe's work to me is heavy on atmospherics and drama, with more gymnastics, jazz, and ballet than bellydance.  Blanca exudes confidence but her dancing ability was hard to gauge because most of what dancing there is reminds me of what would be done in a go-go cage.  The piece, which cuts between 2 locations and outfits, is visually a pretty piece nonetheless.  Jehan's piece is too overtly sexual and, frankly, silly to me.  Her buttocks are barely hidden behind filmy fabric in some shots, and she writhes on the floor in others.  More like a music video than anything else.  Neon's piece "Deja Vu" at least has bellydancing in it, but is also very MTV.  Her costume is very cool, as is her Nordic queen look and extensive tribal tattooing.  There are 3 duets.  One I have labeled "Goth Bellydance Meets Riverdance" with a touch of martial arts. It is very charmingly performed and entertaining, even funny at first, and the costumes are very pretty. This duet and one solo have knives in them, and one other duet begins as a mock execution with one of the women wielding a large sword.  It took a couple views to begin warming up to that one.  All this said, I strongly recommend this DVD.  The women are mostly talented, many of the dances are creative and different, and the costuming is interesting and lovely in almost all cases.  In addition, as someone herself learning bellydancing, I feel the camera work is very good. I was never annoyed by it, nor did I ever have trouble understanding what the dancers were doing.  My only complaint is that I would wish to see the costumes in even greater detail because I am working on designing one or two for myself, but more light would, of course, have ruined the atmospherics. :)  In summary, I'd venture that only the very jaded or very midwestern will be disappointed if you give this an honest chance.  Blink your eyes. Rub them. Walk away. Come back another day and watch it again.  This DVD seems glacially slow the first time you see it, compared to the usual, more frenetic belly dancing we've all seen. As inexpensive as it is, I strongly suggest taking a chance on it if you like Goth fashion/ colors/ atmospherics and various bellydance forms, such as the Tribal style and other modern styles. I'm very happy with it+dvd
One of her best works, it's almost as if she lives the part+P+In my opinion, this is one of Elizabeth Taylors best works.  The film starts out with her basicaly being held, without her will, in a mental hospital.  She meets a doctor (montgomery clift) who comes to see if he can figure out what is wrong with her, if in fact anything is.  After meeting her, he decides to take her to his fathers hospital and work on her there.  He puts her in the nurses' courters, so as not to make her think that she is mentally challenged by putting her with the rest of the patients.  To point out the major reason why she is in the hostpital, it is becase she is being held responsible for the death of a mothers son, but near the end of the movie you will find out that it truly wasn't her fault.  Not only does she finally rid herself of the evil mother, but she falls in love with Monty and live happily ever after.  The end+dvd

A quirky classic of television comedy+P+Wow, I'm a bit too young to remember the Addams Family in its original run on network television, but I love the Charles Addams cartoons, and have always liked John Astin, so I bought this dvd set.  It is just wonderful.  Nice clean prints of the episodes.  Great writing, and a wonderful ensemble cast.  And there really is a subtle message in these shows about being true to yourself and being kind.  The more savage-appeal of the movies is absent here-these characters are quirky, but well-meaning, and I heartily recommend this set.  The commentary with Steve Cox, Lisa Loring, Ken Weatherwax and Felix Silla is also terrific and fun and gives a bit of behind-the-scenes flavor that is very welcome+dvd
All censored+N+I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version+dvd
So Funny!!!+P+One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Loved it+dvd
Not too bad.+P+While not the best care bears show it was funny. I also liked how they were trying hard to appeal to boys as well+dvd
How bad can things get ?+N+I dont normally slate films but this one was asking for it so bad. OMG- It saddens me to think the director got paid for this. Please someone- write & direct a good film for Van Damme- he deserves better than this..+dvd
One of my all time favorites+P+Can't believe it's been twenty years, but this movie is still just as funny today as when it came out.  Great script-a perfect cast and more laugh out loud moments than should be allowed.  How Steve Martin's character made it through this trip through hell (some times literally) without murdering his thrust upon companion is just beyond me.  The whole "you're driving the wrong way" scene is truely a classic as well as the question: 'Where is your other hand?'.  Absolutely a joy.  Highly, highly recommended+dvd
Corny, clunky, a deserved turkey of the early 90s.+N+The Rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-Deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around Los Angeles, particularly the Miracle Mile area. It's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can't stand on its own two feet.  The plotting of The Rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare. Unfortunately, the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious. Worse still is the execution of the material. Every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma. Bill Campbell -- ever hear of him anymore? He overacts every single scene. Timothy Dalton? Hammy. Jennifer Connelly is the only one to come out unscathed.   The direction is beyond weak. When The Rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged, so cloyingly "goofy" that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening. Add to this foul mixture a horrendous James Horner score... you get the idea. Still, some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points.+dvd
HANGING UP DISCONNECTS+N+While watching this film, I found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on, and wondering how it could have been better.  HANGING UP tells the tale of three sisters: Meg Ryan is Eve, the bulwark of the family, runs her own business; Diane Keaton as Georgia has her own self titled magazine; and Lisa Kudrow is Matty, the somewhat vapid soap opera actress.  Their elderly father (Walter Matthau in his last movie role) is having memory problems, can't walk and is admitted to a hospital.  He is going to die.  Ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father, while the other two are too self-centered to even care.  All of this could have made for a compelling "dramedy" but director Keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent.  And Matthau is not all that likeable either.  Cloris Leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and Adam Arkin is Ryan's globetrotting husband.  It's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between Ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage.  Ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good, she can't really salvage the film.  Keaton and Kudrow are both adequate, but no depth is observed.  Matthau is more like Matthau than a true character and it's sad that his last role is so unlikeable.  HANGING UP tries to tackle sensitive and real issues but it's so contrived it fails+dvd

Heartbreaking+P+I love these types of movies, b/c all of the reviews on this page are very thoughtful and interesting.  I agree with most everything, but the one thing that keeps popping up that I DO disagree with is the idea that the characters are totally unlikable.  I personally find the characters EXTREMELY sympathetic.    These people are ALL in incredible pain.  They are miserable.  Not one single character is happy.  They are all trying to medicate their pain, oblivious to the fact that the love they are ALL seeking is within arms reach, yet they step on each other to "get theirs" to such an extent that by the end no one is happy.  Yes, May is an incredibly bad mother, but she has been a shell of a person her entire life, with practically no joy whatsoever.  Ditto for the others.    How in the world are these NOT sympathetic characters?  I have a lot of love in my life.  Of course I sympathize with those who have none.   +dvd
No English audio track+N+Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me+dvd
Elvis Lives+P+I'm a big Elvis fan and when I saw this on TV I thought it was great and had to have it.  The way they produced this film was great.  You felt like it was a live show with Elvis.  The way they jelled the past with the present was fanstatic.  A must have for any one who is a fan of Elvis, or someone just getting started.+dvd
Really bad, don't do this to yourself+N+I bought this set because I was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started, and boy am I sorry I bought this.  The narrator is bad, the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive, and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting.    Even at six times the price I recommend buying Ken Burns' "Baseball" documentary, by far the best thing I've ever seen about baseball.  But if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch, then I would recommend the "When it was a Game" series.  Anything but "Baseball's greatest Legends - Diamond Memories".  This set is so bad that I was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and I haven't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it.  Please, save yourselves the money and most importantly the time.  Do not buy this+dvd
The "Plan 9 from Outer Space" of Art-House Films+N+Unintentionally hilarious; so pretentious and poorly made that I was strangling with laughter several times. Jesus/God/Satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways. The maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup, cures scarred children, and floats in the air. The wife bites the side of her finger, has sex with random strangers, and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as Mozart's Requiem thunders in the background.  The movie is technically inept and badly written. Any randomly chosen film of Bunuel or Almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this Pasolini fiasco. Recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious.  Two stars for the "So bad it's good" factor.+dvd
overrated+N+I didn't think Chicken Run was that great.  Yes, I'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters, and I'm aware of its overwhelming popularity, but the movie didn't do a whole lot for me.  I think the main problem is that the chickens have an English accent, making it hard to understand them.  The film was also very dark and hard to see what was happening (no, it wasn't my television).  The claymation is nice, but that's the only thing the movie had going for it+dvd
Black Bike Week+N+The DVD covers all of the bike week including cars, women, and bikes. You really dont hear the traffic sounds, or cars or people talking. The background sounds or people talking is over shadowed by continuous background tracks. When you do hear background sounds or people talking its hindered since the music audio is higher than the verbal or background tones. Watchable, but not worth a DVD collection+dvd
Halloween III+N+This movie absolutely sucks, it has nothing to do with Halloween or Halloween II. They wasted their time on this one. What the hell are they thinking not involving Michael Meyers or at least his mask. Duh!+dvd
"That's what I'm talking about--surviving."+P+I had heard phrases like "Stepford wife," "Stepford wife-ish," and so forth over the years.  After seeing this movie, I can see what people were talking about.  This 1975 chiller features Katherine Ross as Joanna Eberhart, a New York City wife, mother, and budding photographer who moves with her husband and kids to Stepford, a beautiful, seemingly perfect suburb.  I say "seemingly perfect" because while Stepford IS beautiful, there's something peculiar going on, particularly with the women.  They are beautiful, polite, soft-spoken, and seem to live only for being Betty Crockers.  It doesn't take long for Joanna and her new friend, spirited, strong-minded Bobbi Markowe (Paula Prentiss), to notice that something is a little off about these women.  As it turns out, something IS a little off--they're not human, they're robots.  That is, robots who live only to cook, clean, and please their husbands 24/7.  Were they always like this?  No.  Once upon a time, they were actually human beings, with minds, personalities, opinions, feelings, and talents all their own.  So what happened?  It seems they they've been turned into robots by husbands who decided that they needed quiet, smiling, and submissive wives who would do whatever--and I do mean WHATEVER, including have sex--they were told to do.  Joanna and Bobby--and a third woman named Charmaine (Tina Louise)--are the only women who still have a sense of themselves.  But not for long, for soon thereafter, Charmaine becomes one of them, and eventually, even Bobbi, and sadly, Joanna, become Stepford wives, too.  Some of the reviewers have said that the ending--where the wives are seen strolling through supermarket aisles in their dresses and hats--was shocking.  I didn't see it that way.  To me, the ending was more sad than shocking--sad in that Joanna and the other wives were no longer themselves, no longer possessed the qualities that made them who they were.  During the movie, Joanna talks to her husband about surviving--that is, surviving to stay true to herself even when the other women around her have literally become clones.  When Joanna is turned into one of them, she has been killed--in more ways than one.  That's what happened to the Stepford wives--in the end, none of them survived+dvd
the dialogue cracks me up+P+Trekkies who are into the preservation of timeline and continuity probably had kittens when they watched this movie, but this movie worked because it highlighted the interplay of the cast - our favorite fictional characters.    Any two bit sci-fi director can make a movie with spaceships and any bean counter can keep a timeline straight, but we don't watch Star Trek for these reasons, do we?  We watch them because only Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly can play Kirk, Spock, and Bones.    The scene where they're talking about Italian food in the pickup truck still makes me laugh today like the first time I saw it+dvd
Paxil or Percocet might have been better...+N+This movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of "Grande" to me...there are better.  I can't really understand why these flicks of "female depression memoirs" are becoming so popular lately... I could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of Anjolina Jolie and Brittany Murphy in "Girl Interrupted", but not in "Prozac Nation".  For one, Christina Ricci does not do anything for me as an actress.  Yes, she looks cool in that Moby video, but really...she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former "goth actress" -she could star in "Memoirs of Winona from Beetlejuice".  Anyway, that said, Ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles, dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue. I can give her credit for these efforts.  She brings out the worst of the 80's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to Prozac. What I really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a "new" idea.   I think the DVD would be a better "after school special".  It doesn't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person.  I can't find anything in the script that says "I am different from most young women's lives at college".  Plenty of talented, smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs, sleep with all the wrong men, and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher.  Where is the taboo here?  Where are the revelations so terrible I need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly? Even "Prozac" isn't tied into the movie physically until the end.  There really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles.+dvd
Kind of easy, pretty boring+N+I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser.   I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED!  It has been gathering dust ever since. +dvd
Blu-ray screws us here!+N+The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie+dvd
Classic Sci-Fi Movie - A Must See For True Sci-Fi Fans+P+One of the most re-watchable Sci-Fi movies ever made. I can watch this move anytime, anyplace and get just as much enjoyment as the first time I saw it. Very cool and clever special effects that make the planet feel very "other-worldly." Awesomely done CGI creatures which we see more of little by little throughout the movie. Absolutely great scenes such as the creatures pulling Fry down the hole, Paris shooting fire with his liquor in the dark night and glimpsing the creatures hovering around him, what Riddick "sees" with his eyes, Riddick gutting one of the creatures after holding it's arms, Riddick staying in one of the creatures blind spots, and the overall cinematography and pace of the film and way the scenes cut from one to the next. The story is simple--survival--yet highly effective and entertaining with all the characters' pasts and secrets and the choices they have to make throughout the film mixed in with a unique environment and threat. If you like any type of Sci-Fi, you should enjoy this movie.  Best Riddick Lines: "Did not know who he was *&#$ing with." "I absolutely believe in God. And I hate the #$%^er.+dvd
My Son LOVES this+P+He loves his Eric Carle books, so when Is aw this DVD I had to buy it, and it is a success! My son (2 1/2) wants to watch it every night. We watch it together before bedtime. He loves it!!+dvd
Maurice Chevalier remembers it well+P+Paris in the 1950's ... and one of the last great musical films from a golden era. You will remember this film well. The teenage Leslie Caron is stunning+dvd
Unexpected barbs of humor; great score; worth it+P+I expected a hystrionic-filled movie, and was pleasantly surprised by wisecracker Oscar Levant.  He makes the film.  Of course, whenever you buy one of these Joan Crawford works, you're going to get her flashing, emotive persona, but the stiletto-sharp writing and the beautiful score keep you from cringing.  It's a treat to be front row at one of the several Oscar Levant / James Garfield (really Isaac Stern) piano/violin duets.  This film is worth the investment.  You will want to revisit the musical performances. +dvd
"He took the bait."+P+Gynecologist, Catherine (Fanny Ardant) discovers hard evidence that her husband, Bernard (Gerard Depardieu) is having an adulterous affair. She confronts him, and he reluctantly admits that he's "occasionally" unfaithful. The details he gives Catherine are vague and sketchy, and the lack of intimacy in their relationship increases with Bernard's admission. Instead of demanding details of the affairs, Catherine nurses the shock. In the aftermath of Catherine's new knowledge, she quietly reevaluates her marriage and Bernard.   One evening, Catherine enters a bar. The bar is full of girls who host clients of both sexes in the rooms upstairs. One of the girls, Marlene (Emmanuelle Beart) approaches Catherine, and they strike up a conversation. Catherine employs Marlene to approach and seduce Bernard. Marlene posing as "Nathalie" is then to return to Catherine and give her the details.   "Nathalie" is an interesting twist on the old adultery story. Catherine, the wronged wife, nurses her anguish, and then converts it into something peculiar. She selects a woman she finds extremely attractive, and then gives this woman the task of seducing Bernard. Is she motivated to get the details she just imagines? Is employing Nathalie an attempt to control her husband's sexuality? Is a warped revenge at the heart of Catherine's conduct or is Nathalie a surrogate?   While the film is not for the easily offended, it's more an intellectual exercise in human sexuality--there are a couple of sex scenes, but sex is talked about more than actually committed. While the very best French films don't provide a definitive answer, Nathalie has a vagueness that leaves a certain lingering dissatisfaction. In spite of the fact that Emmanuelle Beart in lingerie is pivotal to the film's promotion, this is Fanny Ardant's film. "Nathalie" is ultimately a woman's film with adultery presented from the female viewpoint--make no mistake about that. If you enjoy this film, I'd also recommend another film from director Anne Fontaine, "Dry Cleaning". "Nathalie" is in French with English subtitles--displacedhuma+dvd
Discovery Institute Imitation+N+This is the Discovery Institute's imitation of Emes "Powers of Ten" and "Cosmic Voyage," in another attempt to establish Intelligent Design as science. The Discovery Institute's key witnesses lied in the recent Kitzmiller case and even went so far as to include astrology as "science."  The Discovery Institute has been thoroughly discredited and its products should be avoided. Get the genuine DVDs, avoid this DVD+dvd
Women in Prison sleaze Italian style+N+This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards  corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story  with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and  plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no  option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura  Gemser will find this one a total bore+dvd
Comments from a Ballet Student+P+I think this DVD is GREAT! There are many ballet dictionaries available but to SEE how the steps are done is more useful and clear than mere words could describe.  Unlike some other reviewers, I found the DVD quality to be fine.  This DVD is an invaluable reference for any ballet student. Although I have been learning ballet for only 2 1/2 years as an ADULT ballet student with no ballet background at all, I now take 8-14 classes a week (with teenage students!) and have managed to reach Level 5 and even do Pointe work so I can say with the conviction of a serious ballet student that - This DVD is an EXCELLENT reference for anyone interested in learning ballet.  I would recommend the DVD version instead of the VHS because it makes for easier and quicker selection of topics (imagine having to rewind and forward on VHS!).  If you're thinking of getting this DVD, go for it+dvd
Larry does it again!!!!!+P+As you already no larry the cable guys is an awesome comedian.  So putting him in a movie s a brilliant idea!  this movie is so funny!!!  one of the best comedies ive ever see+dvd
Dear Walt Disney! Do you think we're fools???+N+First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: "When love is gone" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: "Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$?   I'd recommend to all of the fans: "DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!+dvd
My First Exposure To Tolkein:  Enjoyable But Not Addictive Yet+P+I for some reason was resistant to reading "The Hobbit" when a teen-ager.  I was not resistant to seeing these movies; I just didn't take the time.   To be honest, I found it hard to get into the movie.  An hour into it, I could have given up on it.  After seeing the first movie (I was a little disappointed to feel like I only saw an incomplete story), I am interested in seeing the sequel, but not so interested that I'm rushing to get it or where I'll feel I missed out if I never find out how the story ends (which I'm sure will be good being victorious over evil).  I've just explained why I only gave this movie four stars.  Now, let me tell you why it earned that many (in case you couldn't tell from the other 3000+ reviews).  The special effects were great.  But so was the acting.  Very effective was Ian Holm, Ian McKellan, John Rhys-Davies (remember him from Raiders of the Lost Ark?), Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortenson, and Christopher Lee.  Another thing I enjoyed about it is some philosophical insights, introduced by Gandalf the Grey, especially the advice he gave to Froddo on his decision to move forward+dvd
Poor Jayne, What A Waste!+N+The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Buren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing "That Makes It." Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann.+dvd
Kimi is the best!!!+P+I love little baby Kimi!! I was so glad when she became one of the Rugrats at the end. She is so cute and so sweet, it would impossible not to like her. She looked really, really cute at the end in that weird robe, yeah+dvd
Teachers can use this+P+Realize that no one said this is "real". It's a movie about the FUTURE people.   That being said, I teach high school biology and environmental science and I find this to be an excellent and entertaining DVD series. I use it to reinforce principles like: Plate tectonics, Climate patterns, Adaptation, Desert formation, Biomes, Eusocial insect societies, and especially, Evolution. I could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series. I have been using this series for 3 years now and I have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too "fake". I have had MANY students ask if this is real, to which I have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals can't be real but the concepts are real.   Why is this applicable to teachers? The DVDs introduce fictional creaures, many of which are absolutely fantastic, and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on Earth right now, just in different forms. So the series really is about present animals as much as future animals.  I use it in high school, but it is just as useful for middle school. Please, if you are a science teacher, you owe it to yourself to see these DVDs. When you see how good a teaching tool they can be, you'll want to purchase these (or get your school media center to purchase them!).  +dvd
Well produced, fun experience+P+As with all the other HD IMAX titles, "Speed" is a fun ride.  The WMV High Definition quality is excellent, the story is engaging, and the production quality is top notch+dvd
only a slight improvement above Kickboxer 4+N+Kickboxer and/or Mark Dacascos fans may want to look elsewhere. While Kickboxer 5 is a bit better than the fourth, that's about it. There are a few good fight scenes halfway through the movie but then it goes downhill from there. Kickboxer 5 starts off with David Sloan getting murdered by some crimeboss in South Africa. Mark's character declares vengence (what a surprise!) and he goes off to find the crimeboss responsible for David's death with the help of an escaped convict. The final fight scene with Mark Dacascos and the crimeboss is just as ridiculous as the final fight scene in Kickboxer 4. As most direct to video films go, this one doesn't deliver overall so if you are one who wants to see the Kickboxer series than just stick with the first three movies. Trust me on this one+dvd
An opportunity wasted...+N+I saw the Amityville remake last night. I absolutely loved the original even if it didn't age well over time. I think what made the original so good was that the characters who played the leads really looked frightened e.g. James Brolin ,Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger really conveyed fear in their eyes. The newer version stars Ryan Reynolds, who is more renowned for comedy and Melissa George, an Australian actress who started her career in daytime soaps. Philip Baker Hall plays the priest Fr Callaway. It would be unfair to describe the acting as incompetent, it isn't. My main problem is with the plot and the way the film unravels.  The opening sequence shows the massacre of the DeFoe family by Ronnie the son who goes mad. This is quite a creepy sequence and uses similar imagery to the film Se7en. It sets the scene nicely. Then we cut forward to the Lutz family who snap up the property and are told of the house's history. After initial reluctance, they decide to move in and give it a go. Then the weird things start to happen like the apparition to the Lutz daughter of Jody Defoe, the girl who was murdered by her brother a year before. There are one or two jump out of the seat moments after this but I consider the film to be a wasted opportunity overall The film turns into a budget version of The Shining , concentrating on the declining sanity of George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds. This insanity builds up until the end of the film where he comes to his senses and the family escape the house. In the original, the insanity of the Lutz father is only one of several episodes to befall the family in the house. Gone is the appearance of the demon pig, the secret room behind the fireplace painted in blood and other such episodes. Most disappointing was the brief appearance of Philip Baker Hall, an actor who is normally excellent at conveying distress (remember him as the dying quiz show host in Magnolia ?).I expected lots more from his appearance in the house than the swarm of flies attacking his face ? I suppose one of the main problem with the film is it's brevity. It clocks in at under 90 minutes in runtime.  What starts out as a very eerie film ends up another shlock horror zombie film. It could have been so much better really. +dvd
Cardinal sin...+N+Yah just don't go messing with a series' soundtrack.  Especially on the original Japanese track!  :+dvd
They Were Onto Something...+N+This is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies I've ever seen.  Daryl (Damon Wayans) and Kevin (David Alan Grier) are two brothers who grew up on watching "Batman"...and nothing else is explored with that opening scene.  Kevin has grown up to be an writer for one crazed editor.  Daryl, on the other hand, is an inventor who, of course, has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off...or will they?  Yes, his tools are creative, but they serve no purpose other than comic relief, which I didn't find funny except for Daryl's embarassment.  Sadly, the two brothers' grandmother is killed because she works for a City Mayor nominee who ticked off a cliched mobster (Jon Polito).  Daryl swears revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout (which I'm surprised nobody finds since it's at the end of a train track).  Let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie.  The bickering between straight-laced Kevin and wannabe idealist Daryl is side-splitting.  In fact, just about every scene with these two is very funny.  The problem with this movie is that it has such a dark, dramatic tone in some scenes that just doesn't fit.  For example, Blankman takes a reporter (Robin Givens, who's basically a black version of Lois Lane - that's not a racial slur) to this hideout, but there is some music that reminds me of a despressed version of Danny Elfman's score of "Edward Scissorhands," and some comedic actors trying to be serious about the world and love.  That scene is absolutely disastrous.  There's another scene when the Mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks Blankman to be present for the dedication.  But then Polito's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the Mayor, and possibly other people.  THIS IS NOT FUNNY!  The movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all, but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in "Don't Be A Menace In South Central..."  The contrast of tones and themes don't work.  Another case in point, Blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around, but then Blankman's genius idea is "Slap me around and call me Susan!"  The scene is funny, if improbable...but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me.  Maybe I'm taking this movie too seriously, but when I see some jabs at classic superheroism that make me laugh uncontrollably (Daryl's inability to face life seriously instead of as a TV show is priceless), and then see some drama that is not only misplaced, but also horribly filmed and acted, then the potential hides itself underneath a movie that's trying to be a superhero comedy "PLUS" an urban drama "PLUS" a hip-hop flick.  This movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control.  I really want to like this movie, but it strikes so many wrong notes that I can't quite recommend it+dvd
Mel Gibson's lost kick-butt movie found+P+The best action movie I've seen this year isn't in theaters. You may think you've seen it, but probably haven't. "Payback" is back, this time the way the director envisioned the film, not the suits. "You don't make pictures for the elite," producer/star Mel Gibson says today, explaining why Paramount and Warner Bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director Brian Helgeland. After 10 days of reshoots, a new final (third) act was tacked on, voiceover was added a la "Blade Runner" and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new major character. Audiences still were amazed how brutal the Gibson character was when they had to "Get ready to root for the bad guy," as the marketing had it.  Same old story about artists and Hollywood, but this time came a happier ending. In 2005, Paramount and Gibson gave Helgeland another shot at the film, eight years after its release. The tapes turned up missing, so Helgeland and his editor recut the film using film. And so we have "Payback: Straight Up -- the Director's Cut."  Now, this is one hard-boiled movie. Gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot, and his wife, following a heist. Along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and Asian drug dealers, slugs a woman (a scene the studios cut), and stirs up a John Woo-like shootout as the bloody finale. Supporting actors Lucy Liu, Gregg Henry and Maria Bello all do fine work.  There are multiple DVD extras, including a director's commentary, but the one to catch is the half-hour "Same Story -- Different Movie," all about the film's resurrection. Audio and video are sharp on the DVD -- and better on high definition discs, although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty, bleach-bypass film. "Payback" comes from the same book as "Point Blank" with Lee Marvin, an even better film from 1969+dvd
the worst Bond film EVER!+N+After reading the reviews on here i went and rented this movie license to kill with high hopes and expectations. Needless to say that i was let down.   This Bond movie is about one of James Bonds best friends get put in the hospital while his wife is killed. So James goes on a revenge rampage defying M and MI-6 to do so.   I thought that it sounded cool but it was a drag. It started out GREAT with a lot of action and a solid plot. But as the movie progressed it got REALLY slow. And the end is so fake and hookey that it comes off as comical. This is the worst Bond film of all time! It isnt worth even your time.   Now dont get me wrong i LOVE the James Bond series. And no-one can even come close to remotly compare with Shawn Conry! He is the only TRUE Bond! But the other Bond movies are all good. In fact this is the only Bond movie that ive seen that i didnt like. Just dont even bother wasting your time+dvd
kind of aimless+N+I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort.+dvd
Just like old times!+P+When I found out these shows were on DVD I had to have them. My husband and I used to watch the series and enjoyed it very much. Now we are enjoying it all over again. I will be ordering the remaining series. I currently have 1-3+dvd
Heavily edited broadcast tv version+N+The 1983 thatrical release tells the true but much abridged story of Billy Mills, the Oglala Sioux who came from obscurity to win the 10,000 meter race in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The core of the movie focuses on Mills's stint as a student and runner at the University of Kansas,facing the overt racism of his teammates and the white community, and his personal conflict with his coach, played by Pat Hingle, over Mills's racing style. The racing scenes are some of the best on film (if you overlook the out of place football field at the Olympics), and "Running Brave" rises above the level of the other sports hero genre and other racing films.    I have given this DVD a 1-star rating because it is NOT the theatrical release, but the version that was re-edited for broadcast TV. (The movie was released as PG. This version, as noted on the DVD box, is rated G.) Several key scenes have been deleted, watering-down or eliminating much of the conflict. This DVD uses a 4:3 (TV) aspect ration, not the theatrical widescreen presentation. Quality of the video transfer is very poor. +dvd
Vile+N+I have to tap into my memory banks to recall a more repulsive film.  I came up with "I Spit On Your Grave".  Director-star Melvin Van Peebles has the audacity to pawn off his nihilistic fantasies as wish fullfilment for the black population as a whole.  There were a lot of artistic triumphs to emerge from so-called "black expoitation" genre and this is not one of them.  This collage of violently misogynistic images can be attributed to the auteur himself.  The film starts with Van Peebles exploiting his son Mario by showing the adolescent servicing a prostitute.  The film goes downward from there.  Van Peebles directorial style is hackneyed and the acting is amateur hour.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is some sort of landmark film.  It's unadulterated [...+dvd
You Had To Be There+N+Made for a pittance, initially released in just two theaters, ultimately grossing over ten million dollars, "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" became the progenitor of the "Blaxploitation" film craze of the seventies. Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt.  The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment.  En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter.  Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, "Sweetback" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome.  Thirty years after its explosive release, "Sweetback" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well.  PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes.  PPS - I just saw "Badasssss!" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" was made) last night (10/25). It makes for a great double feature, as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was+dvd
Very Disappointed!!!!!+N+Although the description says "animated", don't believe it!!!  The only animation for the George clip is someone moving pictures of the character around!!!  My granddaughter (4), kept asking when they were going to do something!  The other parts--yes curious george has only one episode even though the title says other wise--were very disturbing to my granddaughter.  All in all, money I shouldn't have spent!!!  sandy ;^+dvd
Good Band - Horrible Audio Quality+N+I love the band but the audio quality was miserable. It sounded like it was recorded from the back of the hall with a hand held low-end camcorder.  Maybe I got a defective copy?  +dvd

This is not Teen Titans+N+This show joins the long list of comic cartoon abominations.  And it's done in anime.  Maybe someday they'll do a Teen Titans: The Animated Series. +dvd
This is a must see!+P+My husband made me watch this and at first I was not interested but then after a few minutes I was hooked. This is a must see. You get a good insight of just what things were like in the 30's and how the children of American Indians were treated. Don't pass this one up+dvd
Tommy, a forgotten classic+P+Tommy was the epitome of the 1970's. This movie included Elton John and Tina Turner in their youth, not to mention all the member of The Who. Worth the price just to watch Ann Margaret swimming in a living room flooded with baked beans! That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball+dvd
Don't waste your money!+N+Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it+dvd
awsome!!!+P+it's a great family show. Its heartwarming and funny. Watch it from the begining, it will bring you laughs and tears. Its all together great+dvd
A great movie for Halloween.+P+If you're looking for a true scare, then look no further than this movie. I like movies that give nightmares, and this one is no acception. Vincent Price is a legend and this movie proves it. This movie has everything, from screams, to all sorts of scares. Highly recommended+dvd
Dull, Baby... Dull!+N+As a gothic-horror-lover i bought this according to the high-praising reviews, acclaiming it as "atmospheric", "moody", "stylish", "gothic horror gem"... WELL... If you ever saw Terence Fisher's 'Horror of Dracula' from 1958 (in fact 10 years before this film!) you know where the benchmark for classic gothic horror lies. This Hammer Horror movie masterpiece delivers not only the visual beauty of gothic atmosphere and technicolor delights, but also magnificent performances and dynamic suspense.  Kill, Baby... Kill! whereas is really a lame and tedious experience in this genre.  Despite of its overly moody gothic sets, the suspensful musical score and the lush settings and colors, there is really not enough atmosphere or suspense that may grip you and get you into the story. The plot is very weak and holds no real surprises.  Overall it looks rather cheap and lacks of good performances or dialogues (whereof there are few). The repetitive all too long "creepy shots" can get really annoying even if the director tries really hard to make suspensful Hitchcock-style camera work. Sorry, but that's not enough.  This is neither a real Gothic Horror (cause it's too cheap) nor a Giallo (cause there's no gore).  If you think that gothic atmosphere sets, "endless spiral staircase shots" and a more or less creepy child staring into the camera are enough to make a good horror movie, then this one's for you.  To everyone else i recommend any Cushing/Lee Hammer movie or V.Price Poe movie for real atmospheric classic gothic horror!+dvd
Semi-Good. +P+Semi-Tough is one of the few football movies I never got around to seeing until the other day and I am sorry I waited. It is a humorous, energetic send-up of football, celebrities, and post-sixties New Age mumbo-jumbo. As for what another reviewer said about Jill Clayburgh, I have to agree, she's completely miscast here, but that's my only acting criticism. I think Reynolds is outstanding in this role and really stands out. He is compelling and believable as Billy Clyde Puckett and his presence basically carries the film. What I found most unique and valuable here, however, was the satire involving Friedrich Bismark and BEAT--which was a paper-thin roast of Werner Erhard and EST. It is rather courageous that this movie decided to tangle with those parasites in the way they did, but it remains a rare example of Hollywood using its special position in society to advance the public good. There are other inventive parodies here as well such as the owner's devotion to "moveogenics," and Reynolds having to get "pelted" by a quack doctor. On the whole, Semi-Tough is a good bit of fun and also has something to say to its audience.+dvd
For Love is as strong as Death+P+A young couple, very much in love, stop off at a tavern in a small 19th century German village.  A gaunt, grim faced stranger joins them.  Just recently the stranger had purchased a 99-year lease on a tract of land adjoining the village's cemetery.   The stranger had built an impregnable, `without door or gate', wall about the estate.  The stranger, of course, is Death, and within the walls of his `garden' reside the souls of the newly dead and the innumerable candles whose flames melt the tallow of all human life.  Death attends the young man he is about to claim.  The woman leaves the room for a moment, and when she returns the stranger and her beloved are gone.  The woman gives chases, sees the shade of her beloved pass through the impassable wall to Death's garden.  An old apothecary finds the distraught woman and shelters her in his pharmacy.  The woman drinks a potion from an ancient bottle and is again in front of the walled garden - although now there is a door opening to a steep staircase.  The woman enters and meets Death of the staircases.  I want to go where my beloved is, the woman tells him.   Death strikes a bargain - if the woman can save the life of just one of three whose candle has grown short, he will return her fiancé to her.    I liked Fritz Lang's DESTINY (Der Müde Tod) a lot.  Death's bargain plunges the movie into three episodes, as the actors playing the loving couple and Death reenact endangered love stories in Arab, Italian and Chinese settings.  Lang employs primitive, and effective, tricks - camera angles, double exposures, etc. - to show the dead filing past the living, to make carpets fly and to transform pagoda into elephants.  Underpinning it all is the fascinating struggle between Death and Love.  It's Lang's meditation on this struggle that I enjoyed the most.  After that poignant scene on the staircase I was hooked on the woman's quest for reunion.   The musical underscore is appropriate, tasteful and unobtrusive.  The print is in good condition, watchable with flares and scratches.  Although this disk is a little pricey, it contains no extras of any kind.   +dvd
The Critics Didn't Get It. So Who Listens to Critics?+P+The Frisco Kid, directed by Robert Aldrich, is the quirky inventive saga of a young Polish rabbi who is sent to America in 1850 to take over a congregation in San Francisco. Getting there proves to be quite a test of his stamina, his adaptability, and his religious faith. Gene Wilder's performance as Avram is a jaunty, sweet, and convincing triumph of comic bravado.  After docking in Philadelphia, the rabbi plays Good Samaritan to three nare-do-wells who later rob him and strand him in a strange land. Fortunately he comes upon some Amish farmers who give him shelter and money to resume his trek. After a brief stint working on the railroad, Avram meets Tommy Lillard (Harrison Ford), a bank robber with a heart of gold and a quick temper. The two team up and go ricocheting from one adventure to another -- an escape from a posse, a trial by fire at the hands of some Native American Indians, a visit to the brotherhood of silent monks, and two violent encounters with the bad boys who robbed Avram in Philadelphia.  Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford are one feisty team as rabbi and rescuer in this rough-'n'-ready romp that rivals Wilder's earlier Blazing Saddles in Wild West hilarity. Director Robert Aldrich is a seasoned hand at blending roughhouse and laughter, as fans of his earlier The Dirty Dozen and The Longest Yard will attest. With a full posse of screen talents, The Frisco Kid rides tall in the comedy saddle.  Movie critics of the era panned the movie saying: "The pairing of Gene Wilder and a young Harrison Ford may sound intriguing, but this film is not. It's a startlingly unfunny comedy in which most of the jokes misfire and the evolution of the characters is forced and unbelievable. Wilder is a great comedic talent, but salvaging this material is beyond him."   Evidently they weren't looking for a good time. Talk of plot character 'evolution' should be worried about in film making classrooms. I think they should have actaully sat back and just enjoyed the romp.  The Frisco Kid is an offbeat comedy that manages to convey the sturdy faith of a believer. Avram will not travel on the Sabbath for any reason; he returns his share of the money from Lillard's bank robbery; he transmits the joy of Judaism to the Indians; and he agonizes over murdering a man in self-defense. Whereas this movie will probably not become a smash with the public, it is highly regarded for the religiously sensitive.+dvd
The Blue Man+P+My daugther loves this movie and watches it over and over again. Very good clean humor+dvd
Don't buy this version+N+Buy one of the other versions with special features. This is the older, first-generation DVD with NO features. Nothing. Plus, this is a flipper disc!  A great movie worth owning.. just not this edition+dvd
Overt Child Exploitation That Never Redeems Itself Satisfyingly+N+A well-acted, well-portrayed, sickening, overt example of an adult whose sole desire for a child is based on getting that child to meet his own selfish needs.  He has little or no love for the child based on who the child is in her core, and sends her the basic message that she does not count as a human being aside from being an object to gratify him.  If the child does not mold to his expectations and desires she gets rejected, and this is the horrible tension of the movie.  Although the movie has some twists and turns that shake things up, the man's character never develops much in a satisfying way, and nor do the basic themes of adult selfishness and cultural repression.  As such the movie is essentially non-redemptive, and portrays a sad and tragic side of humanity.  Although this movie is set in an outer province on China in the 1930s, it's actually a good metaphor for Western culture, much as Western cultural norms do not allow parents to exploit their children so overtly..+dvd
Deficient Erotic Thriller Sequel without Connection to Predecessor...+N+The original film 8 MM deals with the theme of why people commit horrendous acts of violence, as it deals with an 8MM film that contains a real murder.  These films have been dubbed snuff films.  Director Alejandro Amenábar even makes a better story of his terrific thriller called Thesis (1996) that portrays a female college student studying violence in media who also comes across a snuff film.  Thus, when a title comes out with the name 8MM 2, the audience will make the logical deduction that it will also deal with a theme of why people commit vile murderous acts on film.  In addition, to set the film in east Europe enhances this notion of brutal violence, as many films and news updates contain dreadful crimes in Eastern Europe that have links with organized crime.  Thus, the implications of another tense and suspenseful cinematic event is set to bring viewers down the horror lane.  However, it would be complete miscalculation by the audience to make the inference that the sequel would follow the same theme.  Here in 8MM 2, which does not even have any of the same actors, director, or theme, merely applies the title of a successful film in order to attract viewers.  The film tries to evoke a similar atmosphere of depravity and immorality among the upper class, as Joel Schumacher's 8MM.  It succeeds to some extent, but does not have the same grim and dark touch.  8MM 2 opens with a shot of a courtroom where a number of people are talking while the sound of a passionately active couple sexually pleasure one another.  Here the story advertises the film's path, as David (Johnathon Schaech) tells his fiancé, Tish (Lori Heuring), about a sexual fantasy of his.  They are on their way to a weekend vacation at a luxurious hotel where they intend to bathe each other in sinful lust, which enhances when Tish invites a woman to join them after a nightclub visit.  Together they end up in a ménage à trios that they never are going to forget.  After the return from their wicked vacation, there are obviously some tense emotions underneath the surface.  It bears the same sentiments that Threesome (1994) portrayed through three sexually experimenting college students.  However, the emotional turmoil quickly evaporates when David receives an envelop with pictures of Tish, David, and the girl that they met in the club.  Due to Tish's father's political position as an ambassador in Hungary and a potential candidate for the Supreme Court nominee and David's future in politics they cannot approach law enforcement.  It leaves them dealing with the criminals themselves, which brings them on a journey into the Budapest red light district and the world of pornography.  The film provides a futile attempt to make it a political thriller, but this too fails.  Instead, it provides an erotic thriller with non-existent suspense, but much erotica. In some aspects, the film will remind the audience about Wild Things (1998), but there is far more sexuality present in 8MM 2.  The film tries to hide a poor story underneath the world of sex while dealing with a rather amusingly silly extortion affair.  In addition, Tish and David also seem completely oblivious in regards to the threats that the underworld could pose on them if the criminal elements so desired.  The many awkward moments within the film outweigh everything else, and leave the viewers with a hollow and empty cinematic experience.  8MM 2 was a rather disappointing film, as it had nothing to do with the original film with Nicolas Cage, and the story was a clichéd combination between Wild Things and an adult film.  The question is whether the audience is better of with the latter, as the story does not capture the audience's attention in regards to suspense, or drama+dvd
Why not let the general public see this......because of drug use?+P+I have been wanting to see this movie for years.  I finally found a copy[...], of all places.  Why doesnt any walk-in rental store rent this out?  They rent out Cheech & Chong movies, but not this?  Gimme a break, Hollywood & Blockbuster!!  This movie isnt even glorifying drug use, like Cheech & Chong.  Instead it is about finding yourself!  The performences by Luke Wilson, Brittney Murphy, Jack Black, Andy Dick, and Jeremy Sisto are oscar worthy.  Not to mention Alisia Witt.......HOT!!  Highly Recommended!! And, you dont even have to be buzzed to watch this.  Its that good! +dvd
Shanghai in the 1930s: Love, and Fate Collide+P+This film is deeply intense. There is often silence that is thick with meaning. The camera often tells much of the story, honing in on the actors and actresses faces ... the spartan rooms ... the city scapes/ scenes ... the commotion of workers going to and from work ... the riots, protests and rebellions ... the crowds of people at the railroad station in Shanghai. The film begins in Shanghi in 1928 where Cynthia (Zhang Ziyi) a Chinese young lady has a love affair with Itami (Toru Nakamura) a Japanese young man whose father is part of a Japanese delegation who lived in Shanghai, seeking political opportunity to destabilize the region. Times are tense,  the atmosphere is ripe for political change and explosive events ...Itami is called back to Japan to serve in the military and their brief but very passionate love affair is cut short.   The film is impressionistic and surreal in how it portrays events and relationships. There are clandestine organizations at work, and it is not often clear who is involved in what until some complicated twist and turn in the plot occurs to reveal the truth. Early in the film, Cynthia's brother is ambushed by a Japanese underground group. He is murdered before her eyes. This causes her to join the "Deep Purple" a clandestine Chinese revolutionary group who try to bring about justice for China and eliminate the Japanese threat.    Zhang Ziyi does an outstanding performance in this serious role. After witnessing her brother's murder, she takes on a false identity, Hui Deng, a nurse who works at Marion Hospital. Hers is a stellar performance along with Itami played by Toru Nakamura. Hui Deng participates in an assassination at the railroad station where Szeto, a Chinese agent of Deep Purple, loses his lady love, accidentally killed in the crossfire. He is also given a briefcase by mistake which puts him  in the middle of some very serious problems. Szeto becomes heavily embroiled in the activities of Deep Purple against the Japanese but he falls into a trap which puts his life at risk. He is in a very precarious position. He makes a deal, it saves his life but ulitimately because of the direction he went ... he ends up losing it.   Itami returns to Shanghai to take over as the leader of the Japanese movement. He is replacing Mr. Yoshikawa who is being recalled to Japan. Itami is managing the upheaval and creating more dissension and rioting, through his spy network and underground operations. The Japanese want to control Shanghai. Cynthia again enters Itami's life and becomes personally involved renewing their love affair but with ulterior motives. However, Itami is not who he used to be and neither is Cynthia the same person she was. Unknown to Itami, she is now an assassin and revolutionary. Itami asks Cynthia to return to Tokyo with him, he even arranges for legal authorization with his boss. Itami and Cynthia attend  a party at the Japanese Club, where they dance to a very haunting and beautiful Chinese tune, called " A Garden Bridge". The events which transpire at the party are jaw-dropping. The twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable and very satisfying. The ending will astonish the viewer ... At the very end of the film, there is actual black and white film footage of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai around 1932 which brings *full* closure on the film. This is a most astonishing complex story with exceptionally artistic cinematography and great acting. Erika Borsos [pepper flower] +dvd
hitchcock breaks his own rule and sinks this turkey+N+hitchcock said in interviews that the most important thing in a movie was if you do a flashback,the flashback must not lie to the people watching. if it does it distroys the trust we have placed with the film maker and hurts the feel of the movie.    this first rule of his was thrown out the window with this below average hitchcock thriller. never before or after did hitchcock do this lie in the flashback thing. the acting is also well below what he was used to having in his movies. a rare misfire from hitch+dvd
One lead too many makes for a dull movie.+N+I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception.  It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong.  These two actors were great as a team.  Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot.  When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring.  Why was he even cast in this film?  This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again+dvd
Disappointing+N+This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again+dvd
excellent package+P+I really enjoy my dvd, their was no marks or lines on the dvd which was excellent.Picture was clear and prefect from the cover to the actual dvd.+dvd
Like an Old Friend That I Haven't Seen in a While+P+I have Seasons 1 & 2, & couldn't wait for the next installment. This was my favorite show when I was a kid. It feels like I grew up with these girls & Mrs. Garrett was the wise grandma I never had. Alot of the episodes now play like those old After-School Specials, but I just can't resist going back to a more innocent, light-hearted time.  It definitely gets nostalgia points & will make you smile+dvd
Waste of Time+N+There is no acting in this film. All it is is 80 minutes of conversation between three people which sometimes becomes so unbearable , that i wonder why I just didnt switch the movie off!+dvd
Two Girls, A Guy and a complete waste of time+N+Love Heather Graham and that is why I bought this movie.  The "explicit sex scene" is not explicit and in fact, is not much of a sex scene.  Great idea and could have been a great movie.  Talent was there, opportuinity was there, but all wasted. Totally out of reality as to how this would have gone down as well.  It would be every guy's fanatasy if the two beautiful women he was "doing" found out he was canoodling each of them and when they find out all they do is chew him out for not being honest about it then say, "I know, why don't we all three date.  We can be a triple rather than a couple."  Yeah, that happened with all the women I ever dated+dvd
Interesting Batch Of Curios.+P+I must admit that I was reluctant to buy this set thinking "Oh no, not another batch of slapstick comedies" but being the silent film completist that I am I purchased it. Although I'm glad I did, this set is primarily for hardcore silent film afficionados like myself. While there are a couple of offerings from Chaplin and Lloyd and single comedies from Charley Chase and Stan Laurel, the bulk of this 3 DVD set is devoted to lesser known comedians and in a couple of instances truly obscure ones. This would probably make AMERICAN SLAPSTICK of little interest to the public at large. All of the films included here are taken from 16mm source materials and while many of the prints are in very good condition, they are not up to the standards set by earlier collections from Kino and Image Entertainment although this title is being distributed by Image. For the serious collector that is more than offset by the raritiy of some of the comedies in this collection. Do the names Eddie Boland, Perry Murdock or Frances Lee ring a bell? There are also complete versions of frequently excerpted shorts such as Larry Semon's GOLF (1922) and the Ton Of Fun's HEAVY LOVE (1926). The Snub Pollard starring vehicle SOLD AT AUCTION (1923) is one of the more amazing silent offerings I've ever seen complete with an astonishing array of imaginative camera tricks. The set is worth it for this comedy alone although Billy Bevan's LIZZIES OF THE FIELD (great title!) from 1924 is not far behind. Final assessment: AMERICAN SLAPSTICK features an interesting batch of curios from long forgotten or up and coming comedians in mostly good condition with suitable musical accompaniment provided by three different performers. A must for diehard fans of silent comedy but not the ideal set to start off with+dvd
Weak Winslow Remake+N+I must admit I am more than shocked to read some of these reviews. All those that haven't seen the original starring Robert Donat et al simply haven't lived.  Some scenes have been completely desecrated.  The Donat "liar and a thief" questioning scene of the young Winslow, is one of the best in movie making history.  The equivalent in this remake is so weak that even 'Sir Roberts' attending solicitor also lends a hand in the questioning !   However it may have been David Mamets intention not to even to attempt to try and emulate. Likewise 'Sir Roberts' courtroom speech was completely missed.  Beg, steel or borrow the origianl VHS copy, and if need be go out and buy a VCR just to watch and enjoy this gem.  If there is a movie studio lobby somewhere to get 'essentials' like this released on DVD I'll join it  ! ! ! ! +dvd
An old classic+P+This movie is an old classic.  I used to love this movie when I was a child, so I bought it and my friends and I were laughing at Sho'Nuff with his big ugly self.  And now my children like it as well.  Yep, this one's a keeper+dvd
OMG. So bad. So very, very bad. Painful. No, seriously... this is bad on a rare scale.+N+Forgive me, but after watching this festering pustule of a movie I've simply got to rant a bit. I normally don't trash films, but this one deserves it SO badly... I'm sorry.  This is a movie that's about as interesting as watching grass grow. A chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting. I wish I could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a "1 star" as the lowest.  I can't remember a movie where the audience's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon. You know when you go to someone's house and they show you home movies of their trip to the beach? And you have to sit through two hours of not much going on while their kids play in the sand... and you keep looking at your watch wondering when it will ever end?  Well, that's "Raiders of the Lost Ark" compared to "Open Water 2".  The Three Stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie, the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes Ed Wood look like Martin Scorcese.  Maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make... because if not, those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste.  Pretentious, annoying, stupid on a monumental level. This movie makes Catwoman, Basic Instinct 2, Jaws 4, etc. all look like Citizen Kane. +dvd
So Boring, So Dumb+N+What was the point of this film? There is no lesson learned, no story to tell, no entertainment factor even associated with it. I guess it was an excuse for Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their Hollywood buddies together for 2 hours of nonsense.+dvd
CRAPPY REMAKE!+N+The Shining remake was Casablanca compared to this drivel crap. Do not watch this movie. If you are a hardcore fan of the original Salem's Lot, you will suffer. This film is as bad as the unecessary sequel Return to Salem's Lot. Ther shoud be a zero star option for this film+dvd
NOT what I expected. Don't waste your $$+N+I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns+dvd
The Stepford Wives Lay an Egg +N+A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way.   The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess+dvd
Warning: This performance is addictive!+P+I've been a big fan of Jean Luc Ponty and Stanley Clarke for years.  I've owned the "Rite of Strings" CD for a couple of years and find it quite unique and enjoyable.  The music is very complex both in composition and execution.  That is, you wonder how 3 guys can produce all this complex sound.  I recently purchased this DVD and have watched it with great delight several times.  Seeing the music performed is quite illuminating.  I have a new, great appreaciation for Al DiMeola!  For all you guitarists, this is a must-see performance!  His Ovation guitar has the most beautiful, clear, bright sound and his playing is unbelievable.  The sound quality of the DVD is fantastic and the camera work contributes significantly.  In fact, I would rate the camera work on this DVD at the top of my list.  You are treated to up close fingerwork as well as shots showing the interplay between the performers.  This performance DVD will blow you away+dvd
A bit light but nonetheless good historical wrap- up+P+I think it's hard to listen to EVERYONE talk about what Punk rock was - to sort of link MC5 to the Clash from west coast to east coast - the reality is - like any art movement it meant different things to different people.   And while one dyed in the wool punk might say Robert Fripp's guitar solos were punk, another will tell you that guitar solos are self-serving, bloated, and not at all about punk.   I've always felt that musicianship, of one form or another, has always been necessary, the reality is good punk rockers learned their craft well, and quickly - good punk rock, for me and mine - was never about flouting lack of skill (and it wasn't honestly lacking from the great ones!).  It was also NEVER about punk fashion for my friends and I, and mostly for the original punk bands it wasn't much about the "punk" fashion either.   This set of disks documents largely what we all already knew - that there's really no such thing as a distinct Punk rock movement - and that the garage bands of the sixties, and the ROCK and roll created in Sun Studios in the 50s was all incendiary and necessary to something young people needed to do in the mid to late seventies.   The NY movement vs. the English movement is well documented if a little disjointed here. I never had much use for the romantic lyrical style of the New York scene and while Patti Smith is a genious - she was never a punk to my ears.  Punk needed not just attitude, fashion, or stylistic differences - it also needed something to rail against.  and no one did that better than the Pistols and the Clash - or more specifically Lydon and Strummer.  Both individuals specifically missing for different reasons from this documentary.   Instead we are treated to Henry Rollin's rolling eyes - just fine, a chubby James Chance, pretty good, and even a slightly softened siouxie - as they all coast into middle age.   MUCH of the 80s scene is excused from this movie - Husker du, the Minutemen, the Fall, Manchester in general (besides some quick footage of the buzzcocks and a second with pete shelley (a bit more of Devoto)) and scads more - for a treatement of Nirvana.   Time to stretch and Yawn if you're me. I liked Nirvana, I think Cobain was brilliant - however, it's not punk - and if Green day or Rancid get face time - it's only because the audience was long built and harnessed into place by those what came before. As they say.   It was fun to see Rollins dish a bit out to the likes of Limp Bizkit and there's some choice extras on the 2 dvd set. And it's always interesting to hear Biafra talk (I like him, you may not).   All in all a good purchase for those of you who never saw footage of MC5, or some of the other seminal acts of the early to mid seventies (Who cares about the New York Dolls???).   However, it is a bit SHORT...about 90 minutes. Rock music of any genre to really be complete needs to spend more time with the performances and less time with the interviews/reviews. Having the Ramones bash out Loudmouth is either going to grab you or not. Sonic Youth is a performance band, they are far better in person than ANY recording they've done. Having any sniffin' glue or punk paper (and god I miss those old tiny print mimeographed fanzines - there was something so intimate and delicious about them) tell us it was a seminal moment is unnecessary. If you step in a ring and get trounced by a great boxer, you don't need some sideline personality tell you you got your ass whipped.     OK :) have fun+dvd
Great if you're just starting+P+I'm just starting out.  I have tried to get into other video workouts and I just can't.  I screw up every dance maneuver or "walking" based move they throw at me.  Debbie does the workout so that I (as a complete clutz and I HATE exercise because I feel stupid that I'm not coordinated)feel like I can do it again.  I like her telling me about coaching because I need it.  If you need encouragement for getting started this is a great place to start.  There is also a 50 min. CD you can use for outdoors. I don't need cute or chatty or some aerobic glam girl.  This is a great place to start.  I can't see myself doing only this video, but give it a go.  It's definately motivated me for 5 days solid.+dvd
Doris' Expressions are Priceless+P+Season Two starts off with a bang as Doris gets a job in San Francisco.  The farm is still present though with Grandpa and the boys.  Doris is a fantastic comedienne.  Her expressions are absolutely priceless....the way she rolls her eyes in exasperation is a classic "Day" trademark.  The way she incorporates the "ums" in her speech is natural without being phonetically annoying....another "Day" trademark.  She is a joy to behold and McClean Stevenson and Rose Marie are on hand as great second bananas!!  This collection has some truly hilarious episodes!!  I laughed my head off in most of them!!  A timeless series for the whole family to enjoy!!  No sex, no violence, no innuendos....just good "wholesome" fun!+dvd

Interesting Twist to the Stockholm Syndrome+P+This film is about finding a Nazi approximately 50 years after World War II in order to assassinate him. The Mossad agent, Eyal, just returned from Turkey and killed a terrorist there. His new assignment is to be a tour guide to a young German named Alex Himmelman, whose grandfather was the Nazi killer. The plan is to get friendly with this tourist and learn whether or not his grandfather is still alive, then "to do God's work before God is ready to take him" according to the Director of Mossad. The elder Himmellman is believed to be alive in Argentina where he escaped after the war. Unfortunately, when Eyal arrives home after the Turkish assignment, he finds his wife dead on their bed. She had committed suicide ... This life-altering event may affect his judgement and skills according to his superior. He is offered counseling but declines. His  shooting abilities are tested on a target range from time to time, to ensure he is able to complete this important mission.  The film is fascinating on many levels. It delves into a deeply serious subject and questions the ethics of doing this type of work in a most creative and artistic manner. As Eyal becomes more friendly with Alex and his sister Pia who lives on a kibbutz, he begins to like them. Eyal places a bug in Pia's apartment to catch any conversation they may have about their grandfather's past. The conversations are all innocent until one night, when Alex tries to pursuade Pia to return to Berlin to visit her parents, to attend her father's birthday party. It turns out, Pia  had a huge fight with her dad about the cover-up of what her grandfather had done during the war. One does wonder, why does the granddaughter of a Nazi end up working in a kibbutz in Israel? The film builds suspense and mystery based on this very question. The complex nature of the film makes it a superior viewing experience. The subject of the film is dealt with in a senstive manner and is balanced with humor. Eyal is played by a very handsome Israeli actor who befriends Alex and then learns by chance that Alex is gay. This subject is presented in a natural flow within the story line of the film ... The metaphor of "walking on water" as Jesus did on the Sea of Galilee is used with great affect and meaning. The viewer will be thrilled and entertained as intensity builds and the mysteries become more complex before they are resolved. There is a huge unexpected climax before the surprise ending brings about a 360 degree resolution to the conflicts. This is a most highly recommended viewing experience.

Great Horror flicks+P+The 1st one is Excellent, The Second one is BLAHHHH but funny and fun to watch, the third one is better then the second one but not better then the first one lo+dvd
My 3 year old loves this video!!+P+He asks to watch this several times a day and even when we're not home, he asks to see it when we get home!!  It keeps his attention the entire time it's on.  Highly recommend this entire series of videos!! We have them all!+dvd
Bubble Boy+P+This movie is hilarious!  Jake Gyllenhaal plays, Jimmy, a young man who has lived in a bubble all of his life because he has no immunities. When Jimmy's love interest decides to marry someone else, Jimmy must cross the country to get to Niagra Falls to stop the wedding.  Of course, he meets many new faces and adventures along the way. This movie makes me laugh no matter how crappy the day is so if you are interested in slap stick comedy, buy it and watch it with your friends.  Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as usual.  This actor's range is impressive..how'd Donnie Darko go from living in a bubble to being a gay cowboy?  It is just neat.+dvd
santa's here+P+stay far away from the sequel, but watch this one. It was definitely worth the money spent on this. People offended by this movie had no lives or no other current events to spew hateful remarks at. why, or who, would NOT want to see Santa kill off people? this is a society who watches leprachauns, snow men, scarecrows and god knows what else kill people for entertainment. but this movie puts all the others to shame and stands out to me as a truly unique and enjoyable experience.+dvd
A little bit of crab!!!+N+The movie Silent Night Deadly Night was not a suprise as i thought it would be... The Silent Night part 2 was  a crab! While i was wathing it i thought i was watching part 1 again. The first fifty minutes of the movie was a revision of part 1. Dont bother to buy it..At least not the part 2!!!!!!!!+dvd
Great historical fiction!+P+I daresay that Mann's adaptation of the film is better than Cooper's book.  Expanded scenes are slight, but fun additions to the a fantastic film+dvd
Defective DVD?+N+I'm a fairly dedicated Blur fan, so it seemed that I'd enjoy this DVD.  The only problem was the sound...which was mostly distorted and sounded like it was "static-y", for lack of a better term.  After watching it a few times, I went to the fan site www.blur.co.uk and in the forums found that many others had experienced the same problem.  Apparently "Starshaped" was originally realeased on VHS when this footage was first captured in the early 90's and the VHS version has much better sound, confirming that the sound isn't just "raw", as it is live concert footage.  One theory is that the sound was not correctly "mastered" when this DVD was produced, hence it is likely a problem on all copies of this DVD.  I do have to say that the US version of the video for "There's No Other Way" was good (it's a hidden easter egg - click on the star in the top level menu).  But I couldn't justify spending $13-14 for just one music video.  I have returned the DVD for a refund+dvd
Good, but overrated.+N+There are better Cary Grant movies out there to watch. This one is just about ok. The movie DVD is released by various companies. I had the BFC edition, and was not very thrilled by the print+dvd
In the beginning...+P+Holy cow, these 10-minute animated shorts are awesome!  The funnest part in watching them is to see Superman, Clark Kent, Lois Lane and the whole gang in their originality.   The stories are basic but smart, quick-paced, exciting, and heroic.  Yeah, the soundtracks are a bit over-the top at times, but that was the music style of adventure movies in the 1940s.   I love the spirited characterizations and some of the stories like with the volcano, the runaway train robbery, etc.  I also noticed how the recent Donner and Singer films have borrowed from these.   Especially in "Superman Returns", his flying style of dropping out of the sky feet-first was originally done in these animations -- COOL!  A must for Superman fans.+dvd
Cheeseburgers not out of reach for action 'legend'+P+Whoa.  Seagal has just gone off in the last few years.  After getting back to theaters with Exit Wounds in 2001, he made the appalling Half Past Dead, and has now settled into his straight-to-DVD throne.  The guy must be making some serious change from these movies.  He's banged out around three flicks a year since 2003, all so dedicated to the new formula that I can only applaud him.  Seriously.  He just plays Seagal, and he's always an ex-secret agent, or something or other, he has the long coat to hide his wide-load body, and he whispers his words, getting dubbed in the process sometimes(!), and tries to underscore his films with a positive message about the environment, or life, or wisdom.  I mean, the man was proclaimed as the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama not long ago, which apparently does not conflict with his doing one cheap action flick after another for a few million.  Oh, and he has a band and plays blues and tours and appears in guitar magazines.  What a renaissance man.  I don't remember the plot or story to this one, I only saw the last 15 minutes.  Suffice to say there are more exotic locales, another Asian director, excessive use of Seagal's army of stuntmen, more shameless Seagal mythology, more fat Seagal in long leather coats.  And yet, he is probably making more money than ever by now.  After that Mountain Dew commercial, because we all know Mountain Dew is the preferred elixir of Lamas everywhere, he is raking it in with these little gems.  They either have a) an Asian director, b) a rapper turned actor (DMX, Ja Rule, Treach, etc), or c) both.  The hairline retreating from his ever-expanding face, the acting still, er, bad, the action still incoherent due to editing that masks the fact that Seagal can't do any stunts (except for the one where he finishes off an IHOP Grand Slam breakfast in seconds), you know what you're going to get.  Idiotic 'entertainment' and a damn good laugh, even a cry for how far the large man has fallen.  No doubt this and two or three other flicks will be packaged together as a morbid DVD special+dvd
Blood Sport Rules!!!!!+N+Let's face it, TBS won't even show this. We've all seen Blood Sport 30 times on TBS, and it's good. Now, I've never seen this movie, but looking at the cover, it sucks. There's no action on the cover. Van Damme made one good movie, and blood sport was it. Now Daniel Bernhardt tries to jump on and ruins everything. It's like watching The Karate Kid III, after Ralphie grew up. Don't read the reviews for this. Look at the cover and hit yourself. Continue hitting yourself until you realize you were about to make a horrible mistake. You'd be better spending your money on Howard the Duck+dvd
Warning - This is not the Baywatch we remember+N+I've purchased seasons one and two thus far. If this third set is as poorly done as the first two, stear clear. If you remember the old LPs that stated "all songs performed by original artists" meant that the songs were rerecorded. The first 2 sets were poorly done. Season One, from NBC has been named "bonus" selections. this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season.  The music on the series is nothing short of annnoying. It simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory. the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated. I can't get over the music. It is really that bad. Bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers.   One can't help but feel cheated when the waited for DVD set lacks the original audio (replaced by truly awful songs), and the picture quality so poor+dvd
A delight+P+I highly enjoyed this movie.  All the way through I was entertained by the story and involved in the lives of the characters.  Unless there were some swear words I missed I have no idea why it got an R rating.  There were a few sex scenes none of which showed much skin.  I would cry 'double-standard,' but what's the use?  Anyway, this movie is definitely worth your time. +dvd
Former cinematic genius goes soft.+N+Back in the 90's Shinya Tsukamoto burst onto the scene with the explosive Tetsuo the Iron Man and the riveting study of ultraviolence Tokyo Fist.Over the years his films have become more coherant but also less interesting.Vital retains a little of his visual energy though unfortunately the story about a man with amnesia who discovers he's dissecting his lost love at a college isn't very compelling.There are some nice dream sequences but the film lacks the energy and sheer creative force of Tsukamoto's earlier films+dvd
Definitely worth buying+P+I use this video as an adjunct to taking classes in both tribal and cabaret styles. The warm-up is thorough and the explanations throughout the DVD are helpful. The break-up of the choreography allows you to personalize your session goals. I have been studying bellydance for a little over a year and this DVD helps solidify the foundations and also provides enough of a challenge to keep me coming back+dvd
Yawn!+N+Has nobody seen through Scorseses weak plots yet?  He makes one exellent gangster film (Goodfellas which after all was based on a book) then repeats the same formula for almost every other film.  So we have the Italian mafia in Goodfellas, the Jewish mafia in Once upon a time, back to the Italians but change location for Casino and now we have the Irish and 'native' mafia.  So what next for Scorsese when he runs out of ethnic groups for his mafia films?    This film lacks everything.  Loosely based on historical facts its slow, dull and only made vaguely interesting by the odd input of horrific violence (just as all of his gangster films are, the start of Goodfellas, the baseball bat scene in Casino etc)  Sorry but this film lacks everything.+dvd
For Every Nerd With Dreams of Grandeur+P+I found this series especially delightful because Robson Green's character lives within the confines of his own mind. Though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged, he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists (as in &quot;Yes, I just invented nuclear fission, but no, I didn't know I was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony.&quot;). This makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations, that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates. If you like Touching Evil or Monk, this series may be for you.+dvd
Machine Head great comeback+P+No words can express my great appreciation with the band...starting from Imperium until thier rendition of Davidian and Block , wow....this is a true definition of Headbang. Since I bought thier first album Burn my Eyes and The More Things Change...I already know that this band is a straight up Heavy Metaller's....Anyway, just watch thier interviews and find out how hard it is to be in a heavy metal band. It is much better if they released it in DTS format, but anyway..Ten Ton Hammer and The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears is present in their setlist...so what more can you ask for....  Order it here in Amazon....NO+dvd
It's not "just" giant robot anime (part two)...+P+Here's the deal if you have not seen the series don't watch this movie. It would take far to many words to explain the series it is something that has to be watched to get.   My only notes are that it's not that hard to follow as long as you  are good at paying attention to details (and of course you have seen the series and did honestly pay attention to it).  Other reviewers I'm sure have summed up what it's about. The movie is basically the action packed, mine-trip, fight scene, blood-n-gore of the end that many said was lacking in the last twp episodes of the series (I.E. what`s happening "out side" of the characters minds in reality). This movie is just as deep and sometimes down right confusing  as the series, and that`s why I like it. For me mixing parts of this movie with the series episodes 25 and 26 was vary satisfying. Many say watching the movie between episodes 24 and 25 seems right. But really it would take a huge edit job to get it right. All the parts are there you just need to rearrange them the to make them right in my opinion+dvd
a good workout+P+I feel this is a pretty good workout.  the cardio is good, but not too much.  She doesn't mention much about the fact that we're pregnant, but I feel it's a safe workout and a good one.  I'd recommend it to anyone that exercises on a fairly regular basis. +dvd
BAD, BAD, BAD+N+I never, and I repeat: NEVER walk out on a movie, but when this garbage came out in the theater I was out the door in 30 minutes or less, I was glad my tickets were for free. However, MY TIME WAS NOT. It was so stupid and totally off-balance that I have made it personal mission to validate how bad this movie is.If gangster movies is your thing please watch "The Untouchables" or something equally cool. Still have it on my list as the top 5 "so bad that it is bad" movies of all time. Some movies get the coveted "So bad that is good" title...this is not one of them. Garbage.  +dvd
This Movie Is A Romantic Comedy Gem! And Ms. Lopez Is One Classy Lady!!!+P+This is a very enjoyable and lighthearted look at Love through the eyes of two people who fall in love but try to deny their feelings for each other. Ms. Lopez plays  a Wedding Planner who falls in love with the fiance of one of her clients. The scene where she has a little too much to drink is sweet , charming, funny and at the same time touching which is quite an accomplishment for any actress. Ms. Lopez is a lady of many talents. She can sing, dance and act and sometimes do all three at the same time! She also proves she is much beter at this Genre of film than the tiresome Sandra Bullock and Meg Ryan. Encore Ms. Lopez!!+dvd
Beauty is skin deep+P+If only we can all see the inner beauty in people, we will all live in a better place !  This is a cute comedy romantic movie that shows the viewer how shallow we are when it comes to physical beauty, aren't we all guilty of it.  If only we can see folks for what they really are.  I avoided this film for years, because of Jack Black, but I did catch it on TV and enjoyed the plot of the movie and eventually liked the way Jack Black did the role of Hal.   Interesting POV's and lots of funny moments in this film. 4 stars for Jack Blacks performance +dvd
Great workout for busy people!+P+This workout is formidable for those who don't have a lot of time to work out. It targets all major muscle groups, arms, buns, thighs, abs and it includes a stretching section. Several exercises are performed to target each muscle group, so the workout is never boring. Moreover, the exercises are very simple to follow..One can definitely feel the burn, a sign that the exercises are working.+dvd
Romero, please forgive me!!!+P+As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch."   But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!!  What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!!  The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's 28 Days Later . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!)  Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!!   And prepare for Synder's new film: 300!! It looks dazzling!+dvd
fatal beauty+N+I love this movie. I had it on video but wanted to up grade it to DVD+dvd
Classic Creature Movies II+P+Well the "flicks" were definitely not award worthy but,they bring a nostalgia when seen.   +dvd
beautiful piece of artwork+P+It's an excellent piece of artwork with the right quantity of additional material in a beautiful metal cast case that's looks like the gas can of madman Mr. Blonde  +dvd
Munich Zauberflote stands test of time+P+While many traditional productions of opera these days look sleepy, either on a stage loaded with so much trappings and clutter, and/or looking as though a group of singers got dropped onto stage and left to their own devices, this is truly a most traditional production, in both all its consummate detail and inspired individual touches.   A certain degree of realism and social commentary inform the August Everding production here. Sarastro's temple is set in solemnly austere design of dark brick and wood, which opens out into a silhouetted relief of what could pass for a Greek temple and also imaginatively to a decrepit looking courtyard, where Tamino faces his trial of silence, which gives us a hint that Sarastro's temple may have seen better days. A certain rigid manner about two of Sarastro's priests also tell us as much (and who are denied their brief Act Two duet).    For the incidents of extra magic that occurs in this production, and that Mozart would have been happy with, in contradicting the cold reason of the Enlightenment, the scenes that take place with the courtyard set just mentioned practically dare you to blink, not to miss anything.  I do not want to give away any secrets here, except that Wolfgang Brendel, as Papageno, in some of the action here, and everywhere, makes up for a few dry spots vocally, by perfectly natural acting of his part. Costumed as a simple warning man or peasant, he works very well, in interaction with everyone else, in capturing the full humor of his part.  Brighter evocations of nature make up very pleasant backdrop for a couple of scenes during the finale to Act Two, for Pamina and the 3 Boys and for Papageno alone, right before meeting up with Papagena in front of a curtain backdrop of a giant oak. The temple, silhouetted before, opens out, suffused with cool light, as Kurt Moll as Sarastro blesses his two new initiates, Pamina and Tamino.  Lucia Popp, as Pamina, is practically enough reason for giving this Zauberflote the highest possible acclaim and for why this belongs in every serious opera dvd collection.  Take for instance her opening of "Ach ich fuhls" in Act Two, which immediately touches the chord or setting for what the entire rest of the aria will be like, which she continues to sing most expressively.  Her scene, with the three boys is at least equally sublime in making her way from total despondency, despair to joyful anticipation of meeting Tamino again, consummated by her utterly exquisite "Tamino mein", upon finally greeting him, and radiant demeanor in helping the Tamino of Francisco Ariaza bring the trials of fire and water and their vocal parts to a close.    Her acting matches that of Wolfgang Brendel in their Act One scenes together, in complete believability. Lucia Popp, as many fans already know, was some sixteen years before, a Queen of the Night of classic status on the Otto Klemperer Zauberflote (with all spoken dialogue taken out) for EMI.  Eschewing the least bit of any exaggeration or hindrance to full expressivity of her lines, Edita Gruberova ideally, coolly yet imperiously picks up the mantle Popp had held for the part of the Queen of the Night before, in her musical and dramatic authority in it.  Her sidekick trio of three ladies (Pamela Coburn, Cornelia Wulkopf, Daphne Evangelatos) are as fine vocally and musically, among video choices, as you will find.  While perfectly seductive enough and costumed to be very attractive to the eye, this trio is perhaps a little less menacing than one other out there.  Francisco Araiza, hardly more than a dutiful presence on stage dramatically, and with slight tendency to pout a few more dramatic lines in his part, warmly and elegantly spins out so many lyric lines here, with so much more colorful command of nuance here than found with Peter Schreier on Sawallisch's cd set or his own much drier, less interesting contribution for James Levine on the Met dvd.    Kurt Moll is the warm voiced Sarastro, his voice rolling effortlessly through "In diesen heil'gen Hallen" and with expressive point both here and the other passages for him. A certain fire about his look or gaze informs even those moments of warmth to convey to Pamina his genuine forbearance in looking out after her. He reappears in the Met Zauberflote dvd eight or nine years later, with undiminished feeling of authority in the part, except for some obvious graying of his vocal prowess and a certain detached manner about him, that had me thinking that all this business with initiates and trials must be incredibly passe or perhaps long by now routinely and terribly de riguer for Sarastro.  Jan-Hendrik Rootering is the ample voiced and authorative Speaker of the Temple, Norbert Orth the entirely black faced and mostly sweet voiced Monostatos, if a little less menacing than one or two others on video by now. Choral forces, including for a properly majestic rendition of and processional up high and stage rear for "O Isis und Osiris", and supporting cast are all in top form.  I am not quite entirely sure, even after reading the annotation in the well informative liner notes (in nice booklet form) of the changing places between Sarastro's aria "O Isis und Osiris" and the brief trio with Pamina, and Tamino joining him,that doing this is right, but at least it is well accounted for in the liner notes and may persuade some viewers.  Wolfgang Sawallisch leads a pleasing middle-of-the-road interpreation of this score, levelheaded in almost all choices of tempo and modern, yet supple enough in its simple pacing of so much, yet plush in orchestral sonorities, even with incidences of doubtful intonation from woodwinds.  He is always very supportive of his singers, if not the last word in being imaginative with so much that this score has to offer.    He improves on his earlier analogue set (that has been reissued on cd) in having a more varied cast here, in terms of vocal color, without losing out on issues of diction and meaningful interaction between cast members.  An overriding blandness, sterility both scenically and musically to the Levine/Met Zauberflote on dvd, also on DGG, helps to make the Sawallisch here a clearly preferable choice.  Ultimately, as well supported by Sawallisch, the expert staging here, and the contributions of just about every cast member, humanity emerges as the highest and most prevailing order in society, in place of a clerical, monastic, or even a Masonic one. The complexity of Mozart's vision is as well encapsulated here as may also be the case in one or two auteur productions of this great work.  Here the charm of Mozart's inspiration endures from start - traffic signals both to left and right from a moon-silhouetted Queen of the Night in alt - to finish+dvd
Masters of Boredom+N+This show was supposed to be about letting horror directors compete with each other to see who can come up with the scariest little horror show of the season. It has devolved into a bunch of has-beens using their ready-made audience to condescendingly lecture us with their dime-story philosophy and politics. Joe Dante's Homecoming, Argento's Pelts, and now this.+dvd
This dude is crazy!+P+This is one of the 2 funniest comedic performances that i've seen, the other being the Kings of Comedy! This had me laughing the whole time I watched it and even after I turned it off! I wish I knew spanish because there were some parts that he would say in spanish that i didn't understand but it was still sooo funny!+dvd
Well Crafted Movie+P+Vivid characters and dialog make this an excellent movie.  From the script to the acting, this movie is well crafted. +dvd
A Good Movie+P+All the lives of the Saints are great, which is what makes it difficult to rate movies of their lives. You would think that the movie would naturally deserve five stars, but that isn't always the case. In rating a movie on the life of a Saint, what is really being rated is the presentation of their life. This presentation of the life of St. Francis of Assisi is deserving of five stars because it shows the viewer how St. Francis embodied true conversion, faith, hope, and love. Despite this, however, I do have this criticism: the heart of St. Francis' spiritual life was the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Mass. Shockingly, however, the movie does not portray this at all! This criticism also applies to the recent movie on the life of St. Anthony of Padua, which I would likewise give five stars. These two saints wold sometimes live only off of the "food which endures to eternal life" (Jn 6:27)! Yet one wold not at all get this from the movies. This is a major disappointment. Nevertheless, though, the movie still deserves five stars, for without the gifts of repentance, faith, hope, and love, the Eucharist would be received in vain+dvd
Not very memorable+N+I love Jackie Chan and all of his movies, buy I will admit this is not one of his best. It's quite bad actually, I bought it cos it was cheap and I like to own all of Jackie's movies in my collection. Not even Claire Forlani could really save this one, she looks totally out of place in this movie. I only recommend it to serious Jackie fans, I couldn't imagine anyone else getting through the whole 85 minutes+dvd
Uhm...Ain't we funkin Now?  uhm...no+N+I was hoping this was a rare concert of the Brothers Johnson in their hay day.  This is a concert of middle aged men who physically let themselves go.  The energy, synergy is just not there.  This is a pass, the picture on the cover is totally misleading..+dvd
surpassed my expectations+P+I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than i anticipated. David Horton is such an interesting person and it was really great to be able to follow him thru this adventure of his. Also, the movie did show aspects of Horton's life, including his classes at the local college he is a professor, his family, his running routine and his RD'ing. +dvd
great film!+P+Though, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was made thirty years ago, it has a wonderful, fresh, timeless quality that keeps you intrigued and entertained.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town.  Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening.  His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses.  Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter.  They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.    What's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen.  This is great for true film buffs and anyone for whom CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was a religious experience.  The anecdotes are entertaining and insightful.  This is truly a great introduction to the films of Steven Spielberg.  Not to be missed.......+dvd
Beware the Warner Brothers Rip-Off+N+Cabaret is one of the great movie musicals of all time.  Unfortunately this DVD version, released in 2003 is misrepresented as a Widescreen format enhanced for Widescreen televisions.  It is not.  The Widescreen picture is "matted" and fills only a portion of the screen on newer HD sets.  Since there is no other version available, if you love the movie this is the only way to own it.  Shame on Warner Brothers for not releasing a classic like this with a pristine print that does the film justice+dvd
Physical quality VS content+N+Several of the disks had physical defects which ruined the experience.  I requested a replacement and received a refund.  Who's stearing the ship?+dvd
A Pleasant Scott Western That Could Have Been More+N+Any Western boasting the likes of Randolph Scott, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Marvin should be an all-time great, but Stranger Wore A Gun proves that his films with Budd Boetticher were far superior to most of his films, and makes you wonder what Scott's Boetticher films would have been like if he'd had such great co-stars as he did in this film.  Scott plays a former Confederate spy who joins with an old war colleague to stage a gold robbery in Arizona. Scott changes his mind, and tries to stop the robbery. George Macready, playing the bad guy, is his usual despicable self, and Marvin and Borgnine are solid as usual as two of Macready's gang.  One of the problems with this film is that it was filmed for 3D, which is obnoxious and distracting, as objects and people point toward the screen for an effect which is no longer viable. The dialogue is also not as cleverly pointed as it was in Scott's better films.  Stranger Wore A Gun is not a bad film, but not in Scott's top five best Westerns, and possibly not even his top ten+dvd
why this movie stinks+N+In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and  totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.  In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really "love eachother". If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called "Melody", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off.+dvd
Fabulous set design, loved the acting, doesn't get any better than this!+P+I have to agree with Michael La Vean's review in many ways.  La Vean's review mentions that the film must have had an unlimited budget.  I had this same thought throughout the entire film.  You will be in heaven for 6 hours if you love extremely detailed period design & costumes (here most, possibly all - I can't remember - were filmed in the historically correct chateaux & palaces).  If you adore fabulous 18th & early 19th century French interiors, which I am sadly obsessed with, then you will absolutely be entranced.  It was all executed so incredibly well down to every last detail.    The acting in the film was magnificent.  Isabella Rossellini was incredibly charming as the character of Josephine.  This was by far the best role that I've ever seen her play.  Christian Clavier was so charming I developed a bit of a crush on him by the end of the movie.  John Malkovich, was extremely convincing and played his role absolutely beautifully as well.  I consider him to be one of the few (if not the best) great actors of this age.  Gerard Depardieu played his role wonderfully.  If you were to read a novel with a character similar to Napoleon  you wouldn't believe it to be possible for someone to have had such a productive life in the short amount of time spent on earth.  A beautiful film that I will treasure for many years!  I hope that A&E will be able to continue be involved with equally beautiful films based on history!!+dvd
Living proof that TV personalities don't belong onstage!+N+SPARE YOURSELF THIS EXPERIENCE!   Much as I adore Gilbert & Sullivan, and could even tolerate The Hollywood Squares quiz show once upon a time, I can't figure out why anyone thought Peter Marshall would be able to contribute to a G&S production.  And sure enough, he couldn't.  In fact, his presence is one of the many downfalls of this production, which include mediocre choreography, a poorly designed set, unconvincing personalities, and some truly bizarre camera work. It's difficult to even sit through this embarrassing production once.  You'll be better off catching a local amateur production. +dvd
not so speedy+N+Really, the reason Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus, but a BOAT this time around.  Do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus?  Even if a boat is fast, do you think that's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets?  I don't.  What kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid?  OTHER boats?  Ocean buoys?  A bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch.  Speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original.  I watched the movie twice and wasn't satisfied either time.  It's an okay movie, though.  But don't expect "speed".+dvd
Putrid+N+Use disc as a coaster.  Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.  This is one of the worst films ever made...And not in a good way+dvd
Dissappointed!+N+Shortcut to Nirvana: If you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic India, this is perhaps a good movie to watch. I was dissappointed! This film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the Kumbh Mela. Pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons! These "other diversions" are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations. The story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me+dvd
Dante's Peak+P+Of coarse this movie is great..it was made in the area in which I live.. so that makes it better.. And once again the experiance of buying thru Amazon was very good.. delivery in a timely manner and the order process is goo+dvd
Absolute junk!+N+Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...  Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.  Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.  Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!  Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock+dvd
Great Soundtrack+P+Public Enemy's soundtrack to Spike Lee's He Got Game is some great music. Public Enemy's return after disappearing for a few years is a spellbinding concept album about the sport industry. KRS One and the Wu Tang Clan's Masta Killa make guest raps on this album. This also has another great collaboration on it. On the title track the loop sample of Buffalo Springfield continues through and the Stephen Stills starts to sing the song at the end with Flava Flav introducing him. Favorites include Resurrection ft. Masta Killa, He Got Game ft. Stephen Stills, Unstoppable ft. KRS One, Revelation 33 1/3 Revolutions, Politics of the Sneaker Pimps, What You Need Is Jesus, and Go Cat Go. Recommende+dvd
A Prophetic Movie? +P+This low budget work of fiction from 1961 produced during the cold war era and blaming a shift in the earth's axis on simultaneous Atomic testing by Russia and America leads to increasing enviornmental disasters of changes in weather patterns, increasingly violent storms of high wind damage, tornadoes, thick fog banks and stifling heat that keeps increasing to well over 100 degrees! Is this beginning to sound familiar? This movie may be unintentionally the most prophetic movie ever made. Disregard the sub plot of Edward Judd having marriage problems and you have a well written documentation of today's weather changes with the unified suspicion that we are a doomed race. Ours has not been by Atomic fault, but may be due to increasing sun activity or perhaps, as this movie suggests, we are a little closer now. This science fiction scenario happens in about a month, for us it has taken years. Yet, the power of the press, with real reporters unlike the news bunnies and manni-kens that report our news today dig to get the real facts from a government hiding the truth. Why can't we get them also? All inconvenient truths aside, will someone please stop this industrial baloney and tell the truth?! Like the reporters in this picture, I really would like to know how much time is left before we burn up. Get extra copies of this film to give to your friends. Perhaps some smart fellow in Hollywood will look into it and consider producing a more modern movie with the added elements of today's conditions. All "rocks from space" movies aside, this probability has a greater implication for the future of the human race. A film of value, although today's audience will be impatient by the slow pace and low volume conversations. Despite this, it is still a film that can fill you with questions+dvd
Upscaled DVD at Best!!!+N+High hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release, and I have to admit I am sadly dissapointed.  The transfer is only a 'fraction' above watching a SD DVD version upscaled, which is a real shame.   Buy at your own risk, or wait for a much better release, hopefully Director's Cut, remastered and all.  2.5/5 for effort.  -zallap+dvd
I've had 1080p T2 for 3 years.    There's no need to buy this expensive version.+N+Back in 2003 T2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie.  Not only did it have excellent extra features, but it had the extended version which is wonderful, and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version (i.e. this one being reviewed) playable via home computer.  Now, at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie, but to todays computer standards it is minimal.    I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two.  There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version.    Why do I mention this?  Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras.  You want the best version of T2 you can buy?  Then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $7.00 DVD rack and pick up Terminator 2: Extreme Edition.  You'll want to shoot yourself if you don't do it.  HECK, BY 4 OF THEM FOR THE SAME PRICE AS ONE BLU RAY VERSION!  There's your Christmas presents!!+dvd
Over California+N+There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary+dvd
Classic Western Movie with an outstanding actor.+P+This John Wayne Western movie is great. I intend to make it a part of my DVD library including other Western classics. +dvd
Great Season, Great TV Show, Classic!  +P+I just finished watching the DVD.  I was in college when the show first came out so I watched it sporadically and missed a lot.  The second season is better than the second and really solidifys the show as a classic.  The writing gets even better, as does the acting and the story lines .  I slowly became more absorbed in the show and am dying for the third season to be released.  I see that it was supposed to be released already and hope it will be soon. +dvd
Pointless...+N+Obviously, the only reason Disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created CAPS animation system, because other than a few impressive uses of that, this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer.  While The Rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated, this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland Disney releases of all time+dvd

More torturous sports from Todd Solondz+N+In "Palindromes" Solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be. He's great at pinpointing where it hurts, but I think I'm ready to call the doctor.    There's a scene in Preston Sturges' "The Lady Eve" where Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship, and Henry Fonda is staring out over the water saying something like, "I feel like I've known you all my life. I keep meeting you, etc." "Palindromes" stretches that idea over 110 minutes, using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses.  When she's finally successful, you'll be mumbling to yourself, "This is so wrong. This is so wrong."  Solondz reportedly wanted Heather Matarazzo to reprise her role as Dawn Weiner from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" for this film; when she declined Solondz had her character commit suicide.+dvd
Great movie.  Andy Griffith will never be the same.+P+Great movie on the power of the media that still resonates today.  Griffith and Patricia Neal give great performances.  Well written and well acted. +dvd
She's a better singer than comedian+N+I loved Borat, the Jackass movies, the Clerks movies...all offensive humor but very very funny. So I thought I would like this. I hated it! The so called jokes just didn't work. I don't think it's even the jokes themselves, but her timing, delivery, and especially her attitude of look at me, I'm so funny and bad! She's not original, just a complete gimmick with PR as slick as her black hair. How much did audience members get paid to laugh? Or maybe it's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience. It was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that I will never get back. Comedy isn't supposed to put you in a bad mood. How could I not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies? I won't bother trying to resell it. I'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch Borat for some comic relief.+dvd
poor mr. king,will they ever get one of his short stories right??+N+so bad that i will just say this,read the book night shift and find out what this movie should of and could of been!!! skip this mess!+dvd
spongebo never gets old+P+i thought this one was hilarious my favorite episode was squrille jokes. spongebob does stand up at the krusty krab.His first few lokes were lousy so spongebob starts looking around for anything to make a joke about and he sees sandy the squrille and he makes fun of her so every one thinks she is dumb. i thought it was so funny. I think everyone should get this movie if there a spongebob fan. And adults if you think im not going to waste money on a talking sponge and listen to his kiddy jokes. Well you should get it cause there is a lot of jokes that kids dont understand but adults do+dvd
Defective, may be Pirated  and misleading Title+N+First of all the DVD inside is not the famous "36th Chamber of Shaolin". It is "Return to the 36th Chamber", sequel to the original movie.  The Video quality is so poor that I think it is a pirated copy.  I cannot believe Amazon can sell such item.+dvd
We Still Love Rocky+P+I figured I would watch this movie on a Lark...We all know the jokes about rocky and infinite sequels.   The days leading up before I saw the movie, I would chant "Rocky, Rocky" to my girlfriend (not a fan).  I was all but prepared for the comic spoofs I was going to make afterward...but then something happened.   As I watched the movie all jokes feel aside when I realized that this was the best Rocky ever! There was a depth and maturity to this movie, probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years. There was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture. One can almost see themselves in Philly, going up to Rocky and shaking his hand. This character is that real.  When you watch this final installment, you will realize why you originally were drawn to the Rocky movies and character 30 years ago. Rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit. And he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans.  Check out this Movie.               +dvd
This has a some memorable moments+P+Murphy was at his best in this. This was the era where Eddie Murphy was the "it" guy. Everything he did turned to gold. And back then, this was gold. Samuel L. Jackson was unknown in the eighties even though he was earning his living out of acting in Hollywood films. At the beginning of this movie he plays the father of Eddie Murphy whose raw, cutting edge humor raises eyebrows and complete silence amongst his family.  I have watched "Raw" many times and found it very funny to a point. The last 25 minutes are kind of dull, and not much, if any laughs but it's pretty much a laugh riot up until the last 25 minutes or so.  The funniest parts include the Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor imitations, and the part about Eddie wanting a McDonald's hamburger as a kid. Even when it loses its momentum toward the end, I still watch this disc just for that.+dvd
Lemmings, I Think Not!+N+Why is it that studios think they know what we like, and even if we don't like, they know best and we should follow as "Lemmings" right over the cliff's edge. This is a classic movie and deserves to be released in it's original movie-release ratio, in other words, WIDESCREEN. I can deal with "Colorization" by turning off the color (If I so desire), but with Pan & Scan treatment of a movie, the only other alternative is to not buy the P&S version. I choose the latter. I still have a laser-disc copied to VHS version that is in it's original aspect ratio, and I will just have to dig this out of the closet. I have a brand new(Bought 3yrs ago)VHS player still in the box, just for this purpose. Wake up Hollywood, don't be a bunch of schmucks, make P&S disappear forever!!! CG13+dvd
Romero, please forgive me!!!+P+As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch."   But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!!  What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!!  The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's 28 Days Later . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!)  Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!!   And prepare for Synder's new film: 300!! It looks dazzling!+dvd
Its sad that the hell raiser debut and hellbound were the only great hell raisers.+P+For Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), the nightmares never end. Still fresh in her fevered memory of her father's skinned corpse, the evil machinations of her uncle Frank's reanimated body and the unspeakable perversity of the Cenobites. But the worst is yet to come. From beyond the Outer Darkness, from the darkest regions of the imagination comes Hellbound: Hellraiser II. Don't bother with the other hell raisers their just plain crap & boring+dvd
A Dog in name and quality+N+Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets+dvd
Typical Errors+N+Like so many things produced and published about the Third Reich, there is an all too familiar error here. It's in the AMAZON product description. The WAFFEN SS were NOT (!!!!) the "black clad" men. That was the ALGEMEINE SS. The WAFFEN SS were the actual MILITARY branch of the SS and were (still are) recognized and some of the best trained and fighting soldiers in military history. The "black clad" ALEGEMEINE is what made up the infamous GESTAPO, Hitler's personal bodyguard, the SD and most of the internal SS force in Germany and the occupied territories. The regular army panzer troops wore the black uniforms, but they were NOT part of the SS. The WAFFEN SS wore the field gray and camouflaged uniforms. Yes, they were brutal, and some were part of some "questionable" activities in the war. But, they were NOT what most people think of the SS, which is the GESTAPO. This error is about as common as authors, directors, etc. calling the GERMAN army, the NAZI army or calling the LUFTWAFFE the NAZI air force.  MOST German soldiers were NOT NAZIs. Yes, their GOVERNMENT leaders, for the most part, were NAZIs, but NOT the soldiers. I've even seen some people say, NAZI tanks!! I was not aware that a Tiger tank could belong to a political party! If AMAZON cannot get this correct in their description, what is the point of watching something like this? Do your research. DO NOT believe everything that is produced, ESPECIALLY by US writers or directors. Remember, the winners write the history. English and French produced material is more accurate and more evenly presented.  I find that ironic as THEY were the ones being bombed and invaded. NOT the US!!+dvd
A personal cult movie!+P+This film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great American films in any age. Artur Penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations. This film threw the ring to Robert Redford and gave Brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role.  And despite the multiple problems among Penn and the illumination supervisor according to Penn told in an interview with James Lipton in Inside the Actor's Studio, the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great American artistic triumphs. +dvd
Not the best Disney movie ever made but....+N+I'm a big fan of Disney movies, and sappy-ness doesn't bother me, but this was off the scales corny. Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time!+dvd
Don't waste your time even renting it+N+It's sad when a commercial is superior to the movie, but the boogeyman is an example of that particular reality.  Even renting this film is a waste of time. Had they attempted to explain the entire thing with Tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone, but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it, then that would've probably saved the film, but it didn't end that way.  Tim is the typical screwed up, scared of the closet kid, only about twenty years too old, being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman. After posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father's leaving (not very convincing, by the way), he goes home after his mother's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in. Then follows a group of messily edited, badly written, and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained.  For no apparent reason, he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named Kate, who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses.  She rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some.  None of this would be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events. His excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up, drives him to a motel, and vanishes. He goes into a closet and comes out in his old house's closet and jumps at Kate (there to give the gift of food). He goes and chats with a girl, who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up, being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons. He goes into closets and appears in different buildings, sometimes under beds, gets pulled under beds and comes out closets, and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman. It would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman, with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory. But no, it was supposed to be a real, non-CGI boogeyman. The result was a cheesy, boring, 90 minute film that should've ended way sooner, because even at a hour and a half, it went too long. It could've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing, but of course, they didn't. And what was that with his girlfriend? He walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished, sees gray water pouring out of the faucet, then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of, yes, the boogeyman. Then he goes to his room, with the ever present Kate, smashed a few toys, and everything was peachy.  I've watched horror movies since about the age of six, a good eleven years, from Nightmare on Elm St., to the Hammer films, to Dracula (about forty of them), to Evil Dead, and this one just sucks.  There are so many better horror movies to choose from.+dvd
Kind of a rip+N+As others have pointed out, the group was just getting it together when the concert was filmed and it shows. While the audio is good, the performances in no way match the classic album they produced. Also, the "extras" added to fill out this fairly slight offering, particularly those for Clapton and Baker are taken from the almost equally slight Farewell Concert film made about Cream.   For die hard fans and completists only+dvd
VERY OLD BUT VERY GOOD+P+CONSIDERING WHEN THIS MUSICAL WAS MADE, IT IS A GREAT FORERUNNER TO THE LATER BROADWAY MELODY FILMS. IT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE REMAKE WITH LANA TURNER AND JOAN BLONDELL. IN MY OPINION BROADWAY MELODY OF 1936 WAS THE BEST BROADWAY MELODY MADE. YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929,  IN AS MUCH AS IT PRESENTED ITSELF WITH A LOT OF VIGOR, GOOD CAST AND MUSIC WHICH FOR ITS DAY SURELY HAD MOVIE GOERS WONDERING WHEN OTHER MUSICALS WERE COMING.  IF YOU ARE A MOVIE MUSICAL BUFF BE SURE TO INCLUDE BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929 IN YOUR COLLECTION+dvd
I Know Fred twoo+N+The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance.  Fred Leuchter was painted as such by many people, some who knew him(and I'm guessing knew better) and as we may be witnessing others who didn't.  Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas.  Maybe a major lesson of the Holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to.  So long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas.  There must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist, so that they may prove their allegiance to the group.  Maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent, as dissent does not equal disloyalty...except in a Nazi state.    There was a great free press in Germany in Nazi times, so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries.    "Mr. Death" is not representation of Fred Leuchter.  Fred Leuchter is representation of Fred Leuchter.  Might I suggest NOT suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary.  That's not clarification, that's reinforcement of one idea.  Rather go and find Fred and speak to him.  Get his view.  If you don't have a preformed agenda (like Van Pelt or Morris), you may get him to respond like I did.  I found a different Fred(and a much much different story) than I was given by director Morris and others.  The question is not whether German gas chambers were used to murder people, the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that, or any other idea.  That is, without having his house firebombed, a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place, have his reputation ruined, or any of the other stuff happen.  If Fred's ordeal is any indication, the brownshirts are alive and well, but I don't think Fred is one of them.  The one fact I would alter in my previous post is Rabbi Bauer's support for "no gas chambers".  Bauer supported Fred's methods, not necessarily his conclusion.  I tried in vain to contact Bauer, on where he differs with Fred.  Fred has high regard for Rabbi Bauer.  The Polish forensic investigation(which came soon after Fred's!) did not come to the same conclusion as Fred, but did essentially duplicate Fred's data collection methods and results.    There was testimony at the Nuremburg trials by both inmates and German staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in Germany.  In 1960, physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there.  It took 16 years(1976) for Simon Weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those German concentration camps.  A former inmate at Auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there.  But all this isn't to say that the Auschwitz gassings didn't occur, but rather to simply say that some may think they didn't occur and for that they shouldn't be condemned...unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like Fred+dvd
Maugham's Famous Story & Swanson's Finest Silent Performance+P+During his lifetime Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was best known for such novels as OF HUMAN BONDAGE and such plays as THE CIRCLE; today, however, he is chiefly recalled for his short stories, of which the 1921 "Miss Thompson" is easily the most famous.  The original story was soon adapted for the stage under the title RAIN--and it was a tremendous success.  The play has been performed countless times and continues to be revived on a consistent basis; there have also been three major screen adaptations.  The best of these is the 1928 silent film SADIE THOMPSON starring Gloria Swanson (1897-1983.)  Swanson was perhaps the first Hollywood "Diva," an actress as controversial as she was popular.  By the late 1920s her liaison with the infamous Joe Kennedy (father of John, Robert, and Ted) gave her the clout to become her own producer, and with Kennedy money behind her she selected the Maugham story and cast herself in the title role.  It was an inspired choice.  Swanson had somewhat hard features and tremendous attitude, and many consider that this is her best overall performance.  The story concerns the collision of a brash prostitute (Swanson) and a holier-than-thou minister (Lionel Barrymore) who find themselves trapped by quarantine and monsoon rains in a rundown hotel on Pago-Pago.  Needless to say, the sparks fly--especially when Davidson pressures the island govenor to deport Sadie as soon as possible.  But it gradually transpires that Davidson may have more than one reason for wanting Sadie gone: it may be that he finds her a temptation himself.  SADIE THOMPSON would be Swanson's last great success in the silent era--the later QUEEN KELLY was never finished or widely released.  But like most other silent films, it was buried by the advent of sound, and over the years the final ten or fifteen minutes of the film was completely lost.  Without a conclusion, it was rarely shown even after interest in silent films revived.  Fortunately, Kino has been able to restore the conclusion with a mixture of film fragments, stills, and title card recreations, and the brazen Sadie, the dour Dr. Davidson, and the statement made about intolerance, tempation, and hypocrisy live and breathe once more.  The picture quality shows age, but on the whole it is quite good and probably the best available short of digital restoration.  The bonuses are slight but interesting, including comparisons of key scenes from the original story, the playscript, the 1928 Swanson version, and the 1932 Joan Crawford version, which was titled RAIN.  (Comparison with the 1953 Rita Hayworth version, titled MISS SADIE THOMPSON, is not made; this version, however, is negligable.)  KINO Video has done a tremendous job of restoring, preserving, and once more making this memorable film available.  If you're a fan of Maugham, Swanson, or silent film in general, SADIE THOMPSON is a must-have.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe+dvd
Pain Relief...+P+Thank you God! Finally, the looong wait is over! A decent sequel to the first two movies! Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back! She's 20 years older (yet, still beautiful), tougher, and wiser. Laurie now works at a private school in California, where she struggles to forget that night in 1978. Her son John (Josh Hartnet) is enrolled in the same school and must face the very devil that haunts / hunts his mum. Though there is a relatively low body count, H2O delivers good suspense and more intelligence than the idiotic sequels 4-6 (I don't consider H3 a sequel). H2O is the perfect finalé to the trilogy. Unfortunately, HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION exists now, and I'm sure that hollywood will crank out fifty more just like it...      +dvd
excellent+P+I really liked this anime. A lot. Especially the music. It's so... haunting. So of course I had to get my hands on the entire soundtrack. Go get "Key to Twilight". Sometimes I just watched the thing to get the music.   That's not to downplay the goodness of the anime mind you. It was good. The only thing that made me sad was the open ending of the anime. You have to play the vid game for the entire storyline. And that sucks because as my husband says "I have no game power." I had so many game overs I lost my passion for the game. I still don't know how it ends. -sigh+dvd
Bad Education+P+Excellent Spanish movie, that really reflects the consequences and attitudes of our modern Catholic church, not only in one country, but in several around the world.The storyline is poignant and sometimes extremely cruel, but, Isn't real life like that???The performances are absolutely faultless and the script magnificently well adapted from the original book,the director, one of the best.But please have an open mind when you see it, and don't try to imitate what you are about to see+dvd
A (very) poor man's "Scream"+N+Featuring George Clooney in an early role and Maureen McCormick (Marcia Marcia *Marcia* Brady) in a comeback role, of sorts. Also featuring a confusing metafictional plot, flat humor, and mostly bad acting. "Return" is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies. There were several of them made during the eighties, most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for "Scream." None of them were as good as that movie, however, and "Return" is no exception. Although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there aren't enough of them to sustain the proceedings. If you watch just to see Clooney and McCormick, be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early (first, in fact), and despite a valiant effort McCormick's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just doesn't work+dvd
Creature Comforts - The Complete First and Second Seasons+N+This items came to us broken during shipping so we could not watch it+dvd
Great Music; Horrible DVD!+N+Most people writing reviews for this DVD are focusing on the music and performances which I agree are great BUT unfortunately the DVD which I am reviewing was lousy. The editing was extremely ridiculous. You would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second. It was more like 5 per second (OK that may be a slight--VERY SLIGHT-- exaggeration). This a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree. Terrible! The images come at you like a machine gun. Please support this band by buying their CDs but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this DVD+dvd
is this a joke?+N+i almost broke up with my girlfriend for picking out this movie at blockbuster. i cant even put into words how bad this movie was, i really wonder what the people who made this were thinking+dvd
really, really, really bad+N+First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.   I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.+dvd
CAT IN THE HAT+P+I LAUGHED.....I CRIED........I WROTE BAD CHECKS!!!! FUN MOVIE!!! MY KIDS AND I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT+dvd
messed with the original VHS release, made it worse+N+Loren Michels ruins most things he touches.  they left out the "Hot Tub" sketch, where eddie play's as the late, great James Brown.  it may be one of THE most funny sketches in the history of television!!!!  I could see that thing 100 times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch, SNL was riding the Eddie Murphy thing all the way to the bank ( the show would most likley been canceled, in my opinion, the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up). then to make this thing worse is that the VHS version had zero Gumby sketches in it ( still great without it thought). i see they have a Gumby sketch in the dvd version, i think "oh, cool, a Gumby dammit segment", but it ends up being one of the lamest one's around.  what, they didn't want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where Gumby goes on Letterman (Piscapo as letterman)?   do everyone a favor and don't purchase this watered down version....Delirious just came out. get that instead. that is GARUNTEED to make u laugh! this dvd....meeeeh!+dvd
Air America+P+I consider this one of Robert Downey Jr. better movies and you have to say that Mel Gibson did a wonderful job as well+dvd
The Mean Streets of Sweden...+N+I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be expecting from a "classic eploitation/revenge" film, but if this is it I'd say the genre died a just death.   As many reviewers have pointed out, there are simply fatal problems with this film. The sex scenes are utterly awful, like they are from an instructional film. Christina Lindberg is beautiful, but don't expect any thrills from her outside of some decent lesbian scenes. The lack of music and sound create a claustrophobic feel, but with this kind of film I can never tell if that's intentional or just the result of piss-poor production values. The "action" scenes are almost all in slow-motion which is simply too slow and robs the scenes of any sense of real violence.   I don't know why people go for this kind of movie. I think Tarentino has some sort of complex: He feels guilty for using the kind of production values he does, while the movies he grew up on looked and sounded like this one. He should get over it though, there's nothing wrong with a movie that looks and sounds good, and doesn't make you feel akward while you watch it.   There's little "rough" or "shocking" in this movie, its just not very well done. It's interesting as a period piece, and its cool that I have a limited edition (though it is not numbered as other reviewers have pointed out), don't think of this as an investment though, in a few more years, no one's going to care...+dvd
don't let the 'widescreen collection' label fool you+N+The rating is for the DVD, not the movie (I'd give the movie ten stars if I could).  On my widescreen TV (Sony Bravia 40" LCD), to watch this movie with the correct aspect ration, I have to watch it in full frame mode, which puts black bars not only on the left and right of the screen but, since this is a 'widescreen' DVD, there are black bars on the top and bottom as well.  Apparently, when this DVD was released, you could just throw black bars on the top and bottom of the picture and call something 'widescreen.'  Next year is the 20th anniversary of the movie's release, hopefully they have an update planned+dvd
Hetty Wainthroop Investigates, Series 1 & 2+P+The Hetty Wainthroop Series is a very special treat for my Wife and I. We lived in England for six years with the United States Air Force and truly appreciate English productions. Patricia Routledge is an outstanding actress and this particular series truly brings out the best in her career----a great investment+dvd
Awful+N+Well I decided to buy my first Girls Gone Wild video (The Seized Video) and it was a waste of my time and money. I hope th other ones are better than this because it was useless. The girls were good looking no doubt but its not that long of a video, the camera guys are idiots and act like twelve year old boy's. I thought this was going to be a good adult video but it is way over rated trust me. Wasted my money and spent thirty minutes of my life I will never get back. +dvd
Mean Machine+P+A British translation of "The Longest Yard," using Soccer instead of american football.  It is a fun little movie, with typical Brit humor+dvd
Good Job +P+I rec'd the item in just a couple of days and was very pleased with the service.. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!+dvd
Terrible movie!+N+I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie+dvd
I agree with all the comments+P+I have seen this movie in French few years ago and I have always considered that it was a good movie about India of the years 1850-1900. Radjah, Princesses, Officers, Soldiers, Merchants, Costumes, Music, Elephant, Cobra, British Pride, long sandy roads, battles, etc.  it is a long saga. Some time too slow but it is a good one+dvd
Zombie baby is too much+N+I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore+dvd
Amazing workout+P+Once again, Adam Ford amazes me with his skills and knowledge with the swiss ball. If you purchased any of his other workout DVDs, you will not be disappointed with this volume. Once again, he breaks the workout in three levels. Trust me, start with the easiest level and work your way up to the hardest. His exercises are extremely difficult to do, but the payoff is amazing. You will gain functional strength and stabilty control like you wouldn't believe. I've been workout for years, using different modality, (e.g. bands, free weights, calisthetics, cable machines, medicine balls, BOSU, stability balls) and I thought I could manage the hardest level...NOT!!! I tried one of the harder exercises and almost fell on my face. Take my word for it, this will make a great addition to anyone's workout library and for anyone who might be bored with their current workouts and want to change things up alittle+dvd
Ricky Martin Unplugged+N+I returned this product to you as it was all in Spainish.  It wasn't asvertized as so.  All other purchases I've made from you get 5 Stars!  I'm a very satisfied customer+dvd
Hollywood costume epic, drama over substance+N+This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive.   Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked?    Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events.  The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty.  They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra.   She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here?  I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome.  Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance.   Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material.  Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great.+dvd
A Funny Train from Somewhere Sad+P+A funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime Czechoslovakia.  I enjoyed watching this movie, it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil.  This is Czechoslovakia during World War II. The Nazis are officially in control, and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation.  Our protagonist is young Milos Hrma, whose father is a retired railway man, and spends the day sitting at home, looking at his watch, and telling everyone where each train in now.  He encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot.  Easily the youngest employee at the depot, Milos wants to fit in, be admired, be a man.  He wears the uniform of a train dispatcher, but doesn't seem comfortable in it yet.  While other reviewers have mentioned young Milos' talk of wanting to have sex, which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty, much can be lost in our descriptions.  This is a comedy, not a prurient display.  It seems that sex is simply the path Milos believes he must take to be a man.  It is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot.  This self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him.   Some may be offended by this, in which case I'd suggest you'd probably be happier buying a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD.  Milos does show himself a man...and it has little to do with s-e-x.  Very worth watching!  Some of the scenes are terrific--I liked the scene where Milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away and then...oh, I won't ruin it for you!  It really is a funny film set in a heartbreaking time.  All the more interesting that it was shot in 1966.  Reccommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere.  I wish that sort of exitement happened on my train! :+dvd
DVD! AT LAST!!!+P+I've been waiting for this film on DVD for years! Thank goodness, It's here and won't disappoint. Clean crisp and sharp with great sound quality! As a film it is a true piece of ART with some of the best performances ever assembled! I lived in Waxahachie where much of the film was shot and was in the "Heart" house as it is called. Believe me, the cinematography in this film is worth the price of the DVD! Texas never looked better! This film would make a terrific companion piece to "The Trip to Bountiful" which was also filmed around the Waxahachie, Texas area. "Places" on DVD! It's about time! Now how about "Bountiful" on DVD+dvd
Not for improvement...+N+This DVD is not an instructional DVD. You won't learn anything with it. There is few tabs of riffs that Flea is playing in it, but they realy are no use...   This DVD is fun if you would like to see Flea when he was younger and if you like this guy. This inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute...  If you want to improve your playing, purchase something else. If you wan't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you won't learn to play, this might be for you..+dvd
Savage Cusack+P+Cusack plays Hoops in a role that can best be described as a typical John Cusack role.  Demi Moore plays a supporing role/love interest for Cusack is a way that is very different for Demi.  If you are a fan of Cusack, Savage Steve Holland, or 80s movies then you will like this.  Similar to "Better Off Dead.+dvd
"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity."  "But I know none, and therefore I am no beast."  Richard III, Act 1, Scene 2+P+Francis Dollarhyde has to be one of the more disturbing and chilling villains in modern day literature and cinema.  Abused and damaged as a child to a point where only a series of rudimentary, barely functioning social masks takes the place of a whole man, Dollarhyde hides the savage pathology of a serial killer who annihilates entire families to fuel his twisted desire and impossible longing.  Although "Manhunter" is less true to Thomas Harris' book "Red Dragon," and the 2002 film version with the same name, I found it to be a vastly superior film.  Despite its retro `80's fashion and the distinctive pastels and sun-drenched look of Michael Mann's work during his Miami Vice television series days, you will find a film that cuts through the meat, slicing through the bone and exposing the marrow.  Tom Noonan's performance has to be one of the most haunting and pitiable on celluloid.  Noonan delivers the tortured, damaged and ultimately unsalvageable soul of Francis Dollarhyde in a way that even Harris' book didn't convey.  He is a howling soul in Hell--a grotesque who is driven by his delusions.  William Peterson is Will Graham, a  former FBI profiler, who retired after a near death encounter in apprehending the notorious and now incarcerated Hannibal Lector (played by a wonderfully sinister and reptilian Brian Cox).  When Graham's former handler, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), asks him to help him profile the murderer, Graham visits Lector in his jail cell, to recover the mind-set necessary to track the killer.  In doing so, Graham incurs Lector's wrath and his collusion with the very killer Graham is pursuing, bringing him far closer to the case than he anticipated.    Joan Allen absolutely shines as Reba McClane, the blind girl who has the misfortune to be attracted to Francis Dollarhyde and who unwittingly serves as Dollarhyde's last connection to his vanishing humanity.  Early on in their relationship, Dollarhyde takes Reba to a veterinarian who is set to cap a sedated tiger's tooth.  Watching Reba's facial expressions as she ran her hands along the tiger's fur and listened to the beating of its heart, with tears streaming down her face, was almost painful.  Dollarhyde watches her from a corner in the room and seems to experience something akin to an emotional release from her experience.  It is one of the strangest and most erotically charged scenes I've ever seen in a film.  When I first saw this film in its theatrical release, I remember thinking, "Thanks a lot, Michael Mann, you've totally ruined Iron Butterfly's Inna Gadda De Vida for me.  Now I'm never going to be able to hear this great song from my youth without feeling vaguely frightened."  Even so, the sound track for the film contains some of the most eerily beautiful music from `80's groups like Red 7, Prime Movers and Shriekback, which Mann has integrated flawlessly into the film.  "Manhunter" might annoy some viewers who remember only too well the big hair and bad fashion of the 1980's.  However, if you can manage to put these aside, I think you will find an often overlooked and intense gem of a thriller+dvd
Swing Shift+P+I love this movie it is fun loving and heart warming it is a great movie that brings back a time when every thing was simple even in war time. It makes you want to laugh and cry with the characters and it shows that women can take up the reins and be just as capable as me+dvd
Oscar Winning Comedy+P+John Cleese brought his Monty Python insanity and "Fawlty Towers" confusion to A FISH CALLED WANDA, a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it.  What I really appreciate about the film is that comedy FINALLY got its due: Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his inspired portrayal of Otto, the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but can't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else.  Twenty years later, I still laugh out loud at his performance. I believe Michael Palin won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well--and he's hilarious as well! (I've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged: Peter Sellers should have won for DR. STRANGELOVE and Steve Martin should've been at least nominated for ALL OF ME and then nominated for Best Supporting Actor for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.)  Everything about WANDA works, even the little winks such as the name of Cleese's character, Archibald Leech--which was Cary Grant's real name (Grant and Cleese both come from the same part of England).  A FISH CALLED WANDA is a comedy worthy of serious study. No kidding+dvd
Big Diappointment+N+I would NOT recommend buying this DVD. Poor production value and if you are expecting to enjoy some music by Christina prepare yourself for disappointment and boredom. It's about 90% PR people ranting about Christina and her accomplishments. I admire Christina's music and her God given talent for singing along with her hard work but this DVD is definitely worth passing up. I would recommend the Stripped Concert in the UK but NOT this one+dvd
Defective Set+N+I bought this DVD set as a Christmnas gift for my sister, who is a huge fan of the show.  Unfortunately, she never got a chance to fully enjoy it.  We bought and returned this set twice.  At least one of the DVD's in both sets was defective.  And even when we purchased this item in a retail store, we ran into the same problem.  So, avoid purchasing this product.  It looks like this is one of those items that has a chronic problem and the company that produces it doesn't even have the decency to make a recall+dvd
'Fear as subtle entertainment' +N+*PLOT REVEALED*  An utterly worthless foray into English overbearance and haughtiness, this film marks Hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment' in the pre-War 1930's.  Working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in London to indoctrinate subordinate English audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of Germany, Hitchcock eases the tension by making this a "comedy".    Wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness (the scene at an Austrian Hotel where the boring Brits are talking about Cricket and drinking tea), he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations, the fight scene in the baggage cart for example.    His support for the upper Brit classes is especially drab and tedious, meandering between hero worship and idolatry, not to mention the wooden acting of the actors.  The story concerns a "secretive plot" about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the Austrian Alps, simplistic, innocuous even but Hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn't want to think she imagined it all.  Of course, she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men'.  Immature plot?  Definately.  Banter, insipid and devoid of any vivacity, is exchanged between high brow English snobs in the most elusive way, bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train.  This is nourishment for those who can't think very well.  The story continues until the stuffy, pretentious, oaf-like English on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema, the Brits, debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper English, sit there in front of open windows, with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes.  Also in this scene, the 80 year old woman "spy", jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily, how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate, or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off.  If you can believe in the superiority of British snobs, then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film.    Of course you can guess the ending, the woman falls in love with the English chap who helped her on the train, and England is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact, an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930's but most audiences will take this as merely a "thriller" instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda. +dvd
If Turbulence Can't break your onboard Implausibility Meter Nothing WILL!+N+Too bad I can not give Turbulence no stars.  This movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality!  The whole movie just does not work.  The FBI agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his IQ seem incredibly average to me.  Rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits.  The rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep.  Logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors.  The plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor.  Problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end.  Also the Christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking.  Most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling Christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way.  No FBI agent or corrections officer  worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control.  Also the most glaring flaw in Turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again.  The Plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid.  While most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds.  Add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown.  It is like the writers of Turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot.  Drama for drama's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage.  Turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste.  If you want real suspense on a plane get Air Force One.  Turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from Palooka-Ville, the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares!. This Turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick.  I can think of better ways to spend time.+dvd
They're not just getting rich... They're getting even.+P+Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd star in this great 80's comedy flick that never gets old, I seriously have seen this film so many times and each time it gets funnier with each viewing especially with the little things that you tend to miss during the first time. The scene where Louise (Dan Aykroyd) wakes up in his own bed in the following morning after a terrible experience and tells his buttler in a very snoby accent that he had this awful nightmare where this negro... and then he sees Eddie Murphy's character next to him smilling had me bursting with tears of laughter, the comedic timing in this film was perfect I highly recomend this film.+dvd
One of my alltime favorite comedies.................+P+The Dukes experiment to trade Eddie Murphy's derelict lifestyle for Dan Aykroyd's sheltered corporate life was genius. To make matters worse lets not forget how much the experiment's bet was worth+dvd
Pleasantly surprised+P+Low production value but excellent information on how to expand pleasure. The woman is "au natural" and shows a very simple way to touch herself which I first looks like it is too simple. But once we experimented with it, it sure gives great results.  It is quite different from anything else that I have seen. The precision of what she is doing is surprising but undeniable once I saw the signs in her body.   If you are looking for a slick production like the one from the big companies, or something equivalent to how pleasure is presented from a man's perspective in a porn movie, this is not for you and you will be disappointed.  But if you are willing to look past that and use the example of a real woman (not a model that fits everyone criteria of perfect beauty with large breast, shaved genitalia etc. and I shall say I myself would enjoy seeing more women like her that look more like most of us presented as role models) and if you are willing to look at the information offered about a woman's pleasure you may very well be pleasantly surprised. I definitively was. +dvd
Inept movie still entertaining as a curiosity+N+First, I'd like to correct one of the other reviewers, who said that SNITCH'D is about a "Latino cop" who goes undercover as a high school student.  Actually, the cop (played by writer/director James Cahill) looks Asian but is supposed to be white.  He's certainly not supposed to be Latino.  We know this because one of the students calls him a Spanish name, and Cahill's character has to ask a fellow student what he was called.  "White boy," she replies.  Also, I don't think the movie is set in East L.A.  The credits say it was shot in Santa Ana, a heavily Latino city in the middle of Orange County, which is just south of Los Angeles County.  Yes, the movie is inept and unrealistic.  Many of the actors playing these high school students look well into their twenties.   The guns look like toys.  Sound like it too.  When they're dropped or tossed aside, you can hear the hollow plastic clatter on the floor.  Yet this movie is entertaining, in a weirdly "what were they thinking," endearing sort of way.  Star-writer-director Cahill smirks his way through much of the film, like he's trying to play a suave James Bond type.  You look at him and think, this inept, non-charismatic Asian-playing-a-white-guy actually imagines he's the next Rambo/tough guy/action hero.  Especially funny is his pursed lips and staring eyes when he sneaks around the house with his gun in "action hero" fashion.  Cahill is morbidly funny!  And yes, his "martial arts" is as inept as the film's toy guns.  He grabs a guy's head and repeatedly "slams" it against a desk in what's supposed to be a quick "jack-hammer" fashion ... only it's slow, and the victim's head clearly isn't making contact with the table.  The victim seems to just go along with having his head banged against the desk, because director Cahill told him to.  Also funny is when Cahill uses martial arts to defeat some eight gun-totting ganstas, partly with the aid of ping-pong paddles.  One "actress," when she's acting "sad" and telling Cahill about her recently deceased friend, seems to be actually smiling.  This film is probably being seen only because its female lead, Eva Longoria, has become famous on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although she isn't much better in this film than the rest of the cast.  Some, but not much.  Then again, it must have been hard for the twentysomething Longoria to play a high school student swept off her feet by Cahill, or mouth his script's cliche-ridden relationship dialogue.    Their "flirting" in the library is another very funny moment!  They're supposed to be teenagers, yet their relationship dialogue sounds written for adults, who in turn got their lines from bad romantic comedies.  I said this film is endearing.  I have a soft spot for amateurs who buy a camcorder and think they can make a Hollywood style feature.  Although I think this was shot on super-8 or 16mm film.  That's because you can hear a camera whirring in some of the shots.  And there's a soft, shot-on-film-then-blown-up look.  So although this film is inept enough to merit only one star, I'm giving it another one for unintentional humor, Longoria eye candy, and the effort of getting it finished+dvd
ugh+N+I've seen many films from all over the world including Bollywood but "Devdas" is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards, so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in Bollywood films. Its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen+dvd
Pleasant performances, &quot;charming&quot; film+P+In the early 19th century, a woman in foreign garb is found walking the English countryside. Her language is a mystery. Is she the lost princess of South Pacific island, a lunatic, or someone else entirely? This is the central question of Princess Caraboo, whose title character is wonderfully played by the alternatively child-like and proud Phoebe Cates. Kevin Kline and John Lithgow deliver very funny performances as, respectively, the suspicious Greek butler of the family that &quot;adopts&quot; Caraboo and a professor called in to determine whether she's a fraud. Through it all, Stephen Rea provides a quiet, consistent presence as a journalist fascinated by Caraboo's story, whatever it may really be (though Rea's hair is disturbingly similar to Richard Simmons' here). This is a good rental film, filled both with these performances and gorgeous scenes of the English countryside. And it is not without a relevant message: do we not hope that those around us may turn out to be more than they seem, so that we may either profit by our association with them or, if they turn out to be infamous, come out looking superior? A pleasant 4-star diversion+dvd

Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great.+dvd
Excellant Video+P+This DVD would benafit anyone wanting to learn more about Chakras- from beginner to very experienced. The graphics were wonderful. I would recommend this to all my Chakra Students+dvd
Nose Dive to Oblivion+N+When David Rabe's play "Hurlyburly" opened on Broadway in August 1984, it was directed by Mike Nichols.  It ran for 343 performances -- a long Broadway run -- and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.  William Hurt was nominated for Best Actor in his role as Eddie.  Judith Ivey who recently appeared in the Clint Eastwood film "Flags of our Fathers" won the Tony as Featured Actress in a play.  The rest of the cast included Harvey Keitel as Phil, Cynthia Nixon as Donna, Ron Silver as Mickey, Jerry Stiller as Artie and Sigorney Weaver as Darlene.  It's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen.  With lead actors Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey & Anna Paquin, there are four Oscars to make this an award-winning cast.  Perhaps there is a great difference from a Mike Nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film Director Anthony Drazen who won the filmmaker's trophy @ Sundance for "Dramatic Zebrahead."  Whatever the reason, the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void.  It is hard to deny that Sean Penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today.  He won the Best Actor Award for this picture @ the Venice Film Festival.  As Eddie, he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker, snarls, cries & puts his hand in his pants.  Watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that William Hurt's on Broadway.  Penn is worth watching.  He's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star.  Kevin Spacey as the manipulative Mickey is hardly endearing.  Yes, compared the other guys he seems relatively together.  But his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay.  It leaves Spacey with a mono-level performance that, while interesting, does not move us because he doesn't change.  Chazz Palminteri as the gorilla-minded Neanderthal Phil that can't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious.  It's unclear why Eddie keeps him around.  Perhaps to feel that he's better than someone else, as the dialogue indicates.  But we don't really get that emotional need.  Thus when Phil drives off Mulholland, we're really just glad to be rid of him.  I agree that the women are the most likeable.  However, we fail to understand why they hang around these guys.  Robin Wright Penn's Darlene seems too bright & together to connect with Eddie.  As the waif Donna, Anna Paquin almost made me forget her Rogue character from the X-Men movies.  She is so vulnerable that I felt sorry for her.  As Bonnie, Meg Ryan takes the role that won Ivey the Tony, but we fail to understand why she is loose.  She doesn't seem like a girl who'd have such low standards.  The fact that she walks out on Eddie seems to confirm this.    Screenwriter David Rabe had worked with Penn in two other films, "State of Grace" & "Casualties of War."  While Penn comes off the best, the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the Hollywood hills, but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy.  It was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film.  I could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed, because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first 10 minutes.  So while this project may have been wonderful on Broadway, the film version nose-dived into oblivion.  Taxi!+dvd
Not for everybody+P+Being a real star isn't anybody's stuff... Whenever you catch something that's too heavy for you, you'll drop it. That's what a man like Mc Queen never did until he became a living icon to many people of all ages, and managed to live with it. A few money helps, but still...   Being still able to act and to be funny when you know you may be going to die within the next weeks, is another proof of how mentally strong a man can be. Or maybe a bit "unconscious" too, as to perform what Mc Queen did in that film, assuming there was no FX in there... Having a funny line that reads "puffing's not my trick", when you only got one half lug left to breath with in the reality, also is a proof of a certain irresponsability, but that's why an actor like Mc Queen was what he used to be, and why the public still likes him so much.   Thanks to mr Legrand for having properly wasted the original soundtrack of Steve Mc Queen's last performance to the screen, when Charles Bernstein's score serves the movie so well... Pick the French version if you want to check it out+dvd
Fresh Prince fans love it!+P+I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas.  He watched and re-watched this season.  And I found myself working thru the discs too. +dvd
Feast of All Saints+P+The first time I saw this movie was at a friends home.  Had to find it because it was that great.  History is explained so well. l looked in stores, but it was not available.  I went to Amazon and to my surprise located it. Love the movie, the price, and the fast shipment.  Would highly recommend this film to everyone+dvd
Genius in the Service of Evil+P+I can't add to the discussions of the repulsive evil represented by this movie or its place in American film history.  But I do have two suggestions.  First, buy a longer version of the movie because these contain the complete version.  Other versions are shorter because they either contain the much-edited version Griffith re-released in later years or are artificially speeded up to conform to modern frame rates.  Second, read some background on the technical innovations of the film before watching it so that you can appreciate how this movie is THE seminal movie in American film history.  You can find some good background material online.  You will be amazed by Griffith's technical genius.  But you will also feel you need a moral cleansing after watching his mocking, degrading, violent portrayal of black human beings and glorification of the KKK+dvd
Babylon 5 - The Complete Second Season+P+This is the best SCI-FI series ever,with incredible SFX,a great cast,and a riveting story line.+dvd
Superb series+P+I enjoyed Hawaii Five-O  as a schoolboy decades ago on a black and white TV, and it is a real pleasure to see it in a crisp clear colour version on DVD. One thing that made this series so good (as I now see) was that, apart from being set in 'Paradise', as its worthy successor Magnum P.I. would be, there was no set formula for the stories; the variety is constantly surprising. The two-part story of how McGarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one I remember from childhood.  The series (and DVD) have been so well made that it easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago. I suppose 'Paradise' never ages or gets dull. I look forward to the whole series coming out on DVD, the sooner, the better! Highly recommended+dvd
I really loved it+P+This was the first time that I've seen a Korean tv series. I must say that It was an enjoyable experience. Even though I didn't even see the show from the beginning I saw enough to want to own the series  so that I may enjoy from beginning to end over and over. I love tv shows like this with a beginng middle and end.  Whether English or Korean this is the type of television that families could enjoy together+dvd
Disappointed+N+The cast is great! Not sure how they got the stars to do this movie The story line about an aging Robin Hood and Maid Marian as a nun just doesn't do well. Filming is below standard and dialogue is weak. Save your mone+dvd
Great movies+P+These movies are great and a must have set for any Munsters fan!! Bought seperately these dvds cost $15 each so why not get this 2 movie set and save $$$!     About the two movies:     "Munster, go home"   The laughs begin when Herman moves the family to an English estate he inherited.   Run time 1 hr 37 mins.   "The Munsters 'Revenge"  Dr. Diablo concocts a plan to create robot "Munsters" to pull off a series of art heists.  Run time 1 hr and 37 minutes.   Recommended!   +dvd
Ridley Stone Penn = serious rock 'n roll.+P+U Turn (Oliver Stone, 1997)  I'm a big fan of Stray Dogs, the John Ridley novel upon which U-Turn is based, and I avoided the film for while because, really, how many film adaptations of your best-loved novels actually work the way you want them to? I shouldn't have worried, though; U-Turn is the stuff, most decidedly.  The plot: Bobby Cooper, an on-the-run tennis pro (Sean Penn) has his car conk out on him just shy of a very, very weird little desert town. One of its residents, Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez), immediately catches his eye, but he soon finds out she's married to a nasty old character named Jake (Nick Nolte), who'd just as soon see her dead-- and offers Bobby fifty grand to do the deed. Immediately, a complex web of deceit unfurls among all the characters, complicated by a number of even stranger events happening at just the wrong time to make Bobby's life miserable.   The main thing that sticks out about this movie is the caliber of its cast, and the caliber of the performances they give. When you have to stick Jon Voight and Billy Bob Thornton seventh and eighth in credits order, you've got a high-powered cast working for you. All of them are spot on. The plot moves forward at almost blinding speed (just as it did in the book; Ridley adapted his own novel), and the viewer has very little time to do anything but clench his teeth and hang on for the ride until the final credits roll. It's just plain fun. I'm not sure why I stopped watching Oliver Stone flicks in the late eighties (okay, yeah I am--  Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, and JFK back to back got a little heavy in to the world of way-out conspiracy theory for me), but I'm glad I've started again. *** ½+dvd
soundtrack ruined it+N+Oh man, this movie was so hard for me to stay interested in. The story had potential to make a adequate drama/thriller, if only it had been directed right.  A lot of times you hear people say, such and such movie "took itself way too seriously." Well in this case I don't think this movie took itself seriously enough. I felt detached from the movie the instant my ear drums vibrated as that RIDICULOUS soundtrack made way into my head. Every moment where it had the chance to build a little bit of tension, this goofy music would kick in, or a wacky Looney Tunes type sound effect would "boing," or do something similarly zany, totally leaving me uninterested. I don't understand why they would go for that type of comical atmosphere with a story like this. It's not like the story itself was clever enough to be able to pull off being told in such a manner. The tone of the movie and the tone of the soundtrack conflicted with each other, not a good thing. The one part of the soundtrack I did like was the hollow, ambient type of music they played in many of those desert scenes, that created a good mood I thought.  A random point- Remember the scene where Jennifer Lopez almost got pushed off the cliff? Ask yourself, would a normal person react that calmly, or make such a quick witty comment about their situation, when their life hangs in the balance?+dvd
I will never watch this again....+N+As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.+dvd
Thank you Fox!  Finally being released on DVD+P+This movie is great fun!   Betty Grable is absolutely stunning as is Carole Landis and very good suporting cast as well as great costumes, lovely sets and gorgeous technicolor make this musical a delight. I've practically worn out my tape and now at last it is being released on DVD as part of the Betty Grable collection. Now let's see more great Fox musicals of the forties released!!   "Moon Over Miami" is a remake of an earlier (non musical) called "Three Blind Mice"1938 staring Loretta Young, Joel McCrea and David Niven. It is also enjoyable if you can find it.    +dvd
Saccharine+N+Unlike some of the other Little People DVDs (e.g., the "Friendship Collection"), this video is contrived and painful to watch.  Even our toddler can tell that it's trying too hard to be educational+dvd
Journey to the Center of the Earth+P+Milo Thatch is a young man obsessed with finding Atlantis.  The obsession already destroyed his grandfather and is now about to end his career as well.  In the early 1900's Milo gets a break when a wealthy friend of his grandfather settles a bet and agrees to fund an expedition to find Atlantis.  Everything is ready to go what with subs, vehicles, crew, supplies and experts.  All that is needed now is for Milo to bring his linguistic abilities in order to translate an ancient book that contains directions to the lost civilization.  The expedition is quickly reduced to a mere handful of survivors and it is up to Milo to save them by leading them to Atlantis.  Milo succeeds and Atlantis is found.  Atlantis is alive by not thriving.  Milo may be able to help the ancient civilization if he can get around some of their laws, prejudices and superstitions.  But all is put in jeopardy when certain truths about motives are revealed and the fate of Atlantis may be sealed for good.  Again it falls to Milo to rise above his bookish ways and find the hero within and save the day.  As this is a Disney flick we know it will all work out in the end somehow.  While I find the story entertaining I am puzzled by a few things like why the Vikings use English, how someone found a path on the ocean floor without a submarine, or how Altlanteans who are over 8,000 years old have forgotten their culture (this usually happens with successive generations and not in what amounts to childhood to twenty).  But if you can get around that, the film is filled with colorful characters, beautiful sets, and some very good voice characterizations.  Michael J. Fox as Milo was wonderful (and lets not forget James Garner's role).  If you want some fun and adventure, this is a film that provides it.  Check it out+dvd
Strikingly Beautiful Story and Film+P+I hadn't heard anything about this movie when I bought it, but the cover caught my eye. I ended up with one of my favorite movies ever. This film is very much a coming of age film about a young boy going through rough times and dealing with the guilt of a tragic mistake. This film pulls at the heartstrings and appeals to the eyes. For lovers of art house films, this is a must have. Often times hazy, often times gritty, and always beautiful, this film will not disappoint.+dvd
Cool+P+I really loved this! It inspired me to love the Nutcracker alot. I like the voices in it, especially Phyllis Diller's voice on the Mouse Queen. I really wish they could've released this on DVD. It's such a great movie+dvd
Jet's worse film of all time+N+Jet lee was dorky in this film, and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad. This film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in America. After seeing the light, Jet returned to Hong Kong and completed the historical Once Upon a Time in China series. The rest is history+dvd
Great Robin Williams Performance+P+Robin Williams was perfectly cast as Jakob Heim.  The critics hated this movie, but I enjoyed it alot.  This is one of my favorite Robin Williams films, next to Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society.  This is a great Holocaust movie and you should buy it or at least rent it+dvd
calming+P+This dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing.  Her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange, takes some getting use to.  It kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time I put it in!  This is the dvd I like to use before I go to my yoga class for some reason.  I guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up. She uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change. A great one to have in your library. Beautiful scenery also+dvd
Yes, Yes, Yes!+P+Finally an intelligent, well made adult (for grown ups, not soft porn) thriller.  No juvenile excess, just excellent acting and writing.  Talia Shire is one resourceful little woman.  The Marines may be looking for a few good men but I'd go anywhere with a squad of Talias for backup.  Jump back+dvd
Definitely not science fiction+N+I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1+dvd
Not what I expected from other reviews...+N+I don't know alot about old movies, especially not silent film, or anything before the 40's, so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy. Most of the shots were very long, repetitive, and boring. It was rare for a scene to have much editing at all, it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that doesn't tell much of a story at all. The woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious. In my opinion, I'd rather read it myself than have it read to me. I don't like that voice there. As some of the other reviewers have said, some of the effects and costuming worked very well. Very impressive for the time. The direction, action, and pacing/storytelling just didn't seem to work well at all for me. Very slow. I fell asleep several times and had to rewind. If you want a good silent film, check out Steamboat Bill, Jr. Excellent+dvd
I LOVED IT!!+P+The first story "The Spiderwoman" was very good. 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. It was a good story line with some humor thrown in there.  The second story "Crevices" was AMAZINGLY awesome. 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion. To me it was a genius story line. The only problem is that this story should have gotten some more showtime. It was the creepiest one on the DVD. Norio Tsuruta did I VERY good job. So...congrats to him :)  The third story "The Sacrifice" had a good story line to it. 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. I think they could have done something to make the hideous head a little more... scarier though.  The fourth story "Blonde Kwaidan" was HORRIBLE! 1 out of 5 stars in my opinion. I'm sorry... but there was really no story line to it. It hardly explains anything... it was just a waste of film. The film used for this story should have been used to make "Crevices" a bit longer ;)  The fifth and final story "Presentiment" was pretty good. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars in my opinion. It was kinda slow a bit, but it really did have a good story line to it.  All and all this was a very good DVD. Glad I bought it. I have no regrets. (Except for watching "Blonde Kwaiden")+dvd
Japanese Goosebumps!+N+This film is $7.50 at walmart! The Japanese Goosebumps! Twilight Zone wannabes! Yeah, it's good.  Good to laugh at! The Sacrafice should have been packaged alone for $1.50; I would have been satisfied+dvd
STRANGE  "MOVIE".....+N+A chemist (Brenda Marshall) working on a new anesthetic takes the product home and tries it out. Her assistant (Hilary Brooke), who may be after Marshalls' husband, arranges an "accident" that reults in Marshalls' face being disfigured. Marshall then murders a woman trying to blackmail her over a previous car accident and has to go on the lam with the dead womans' identity. She plots to take revenge and everything snowballs into a nightmare worse than before. The finale sees it all as just a weird hallucination she experienced from the drug. Huh? All this mumbo jumbo is played out in a very short running time. I wouldn't call this a "movie" so much as a cheap experimental student project. There are no production values at all. The sets are cardboard and the acting is dull and at times amateurish. I know that Anthony Mann has a reputation as a low budget film noirist but this is the cheapest attempt at telling a story I've seen in a while. Ulmer's "Detour" is pretty cheap but at least it's interesting. This was interesting at first but the ending just left me flat. Low budget is one thing but out and out cheap is another. I will not fault this films' defenders. To each his or her own. But it's just too cheap for me to see more than once. So it's recommended for Manns' fans and others with their curiosity meter turned WAY up+dvd
This is a sorry movie.+N+This movie is not worth buying. It's horrific and full of graphic violence. Stallone shouldn't have made this movie. It stinks+dvd
The Hot Chick+P+This is one of Rob Schneider's best movies.  Schneider plays as a middle-aged "hobo" that switches bodies with a popular mean high-school girl. Rachel McAdams has to find the guy that is inside of her body so they can switch back before it is too late+dvd
I could only watch 20 minutes of it.+N+I cannot believe that I paid so much for such a horrible movie. I thought I was buying the cream of the crop and I ended up with this.  After 20 minutes I couldn't stand it anymore. I've never seen a movie so stilled. It seemed as though the scenery was all plastic.  I rated it 1 star, if I could, I would not have given it a rating at all. The movie starring Daniel- Day Lewis was a much better version. Actually there isn't any comparision between the two+dvd
A great movie and start of a great career+P+This is Guy Ritchie's first movie. Very few screenwriters and directors can say they their first endeavor was so successful. This is an amazing story that is clever, funny, and unpredictable. I wish I could write movies like this! A must see for any serious film fan+dvd
A Sad Waste of Talent+N+Expect no sparkle from stars or script in this remake of the witty comedy classic, which has been repeatedly filmed with varying degrees of success since 1931.  There is no chemistry between the male leads, and Burnette is  unspeakably bad in her cameo appearance.  Recommendation: see instead  &quot;His Girl Friday,&quot; starring Rosalind Russel and Cary Grant; it is  easily the finest screen version of the famous stage play+dvd
A big disappontment!+N+the dvd is too short with music content. The songs are edited and even the Lenny White song is excluded from the dvd even though it is listed on the cover. I have been a Stanley Clarke fan since the RTF days and was waiting patiently for this release but I guess I would need to wait some more to see if there will ever be something release from Stanley that is better than this+dvd
HAS ENOUGH BLOOD TO GAG A VAMPIRE+N+Brief plot summary: two low life hoods kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother.  Her baby's "father" (sort of) turns out to be a mob boss (or has mob connections), said mob boss whistles up his goons, they go after the hoods, and then a lot of people die.  If you like watching characters for whom you care nothing about get slaughtered in bloody gun fights, this film is for you.  You don't have to worry about a plot or being required to use your brain, just sit back and watch the mayhem.  Speaking for myself, the first 10 minutes of guttermouth verbal abuse directed at del Torro and his pal by the woman he ended up punching out was more than enough for me, but unfortunately, the friends I was with wanted to see the whole thing, and I had to sit through the whole thing to the very bloody end. So, in summary, Way of the Gun is just a Pulp Fiction wannabe put together by some Quentin Tarrantino wannabe and you could do a lot better for an evening's home viewing.  If gritty violence is what you like, and feasable plots are optional, Narc with Jason Patrick (one of Hollywood's better stars and one of the least appreciated) and Ray Liotta is a far more masterful piece of film than the sophmoric Way of the Gun+dvd
X-Men+N+We did not receive this item.  We would rather not rate this item since it was never received...  We consider it a zero star not even 1 star+dvd

HAS SOME DECENT ACTING, BUT...+N+A REGGAE MUSICIAN BEGINS TO DEAL DRUGS FOR A DRUG KINGPIN SO HE COULD GET THE MONEY FOR STUDIO TIME. HAS A DECENT PLOT, BUT MOST OF THE ACTING ISN'T GOOD, AND MOST OF THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST CLICHED CHARCTERS THAT YOU'D USUALLY SEE A JAMAICAN ACTOR PLAY. I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF THINGS TO LAUGH AT WHEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE. NOT THE WORST OF ITS KIND, BUT, I DON'T THINK ITS REALLY WORTH BUYING+dvd
Titanic owes some of its success to THIS+P+I love disaster movies, or any disaster movie that involves water - Titanic, Hard Rain, Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Titanic ... Yeah I love Titanic. But I was shocked when watching this film how much Titanic resembles it! There's a lot where you can see where James Cameron might have got some of his ideas from.  I felt very claustrophobic watching this film, not only were we watching it in the darkness, but there were also fireworks going off outside, and the film itself is very claustrophobic. There's no natural light, as the boat is capsized.  I had an awful time recognising actors in this, particularly Gene Hackman. I knew the name, I could NOT pick out which one he was. (Very blonde moment there.) I eventually recognised him, cos he was the main character (big clue there), and he was also using Simon Cowell's fashion sense - high waisted trousers, and polo neck TUCKED IN. I don't know why it took me so long to recognise him, but I managed to recognise Ernest Borgnine, who played Rogo, as being in Little House In The Prairie, in one or two episodes.  The Poseidon Adventure is a really good film, with no need for special effects or CGI, apart from the odd one or two. Nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves, when possible, and they would have ended up with many bumps. What made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects, and it made it all the more real. I was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering I was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic, it made it all the more worse.  The Poseidon Adventure is definitely up there as one of my favourite disaster movies now, and I really look forward to seeing the sequel, and the 'remake'.  And I just discovered by looking at IMDB, that Red Buttons (what a strange name) was also in Little House On The Prairie, in two episodes+dvd
Pinocchio+P+It is a good movie for young elementary students.  It was very good+dvd
Fifth Is the Final Nail in the Series' Coffin ... So Bad (And Not the Kind of Bad You can Enjoy)+N+"Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave" (2005) is, in short, not scary nor funny, another disaster in this series. I thought "Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis" (2005) was so awful, enough terrible to become the nail in the series' coffin, but I was wrong. They made another sequel which is worse than the previous "ROTLD." Considering the badness of `Necropolis,' this is kind of amazing.  Actually "Necropolis" and "Rave to the Grave" (the fourth and fifth entries in `Return of the Living Dead' series) were shot back to back in Romania. Director for both films is Ellory Elkayem (`Eight Legged Freaks"), and `Rave to the Grave" features some of the stars of `Necropolis' including Peter Coyote, Aimee-Lynn Chadwick, Cory Hardrict and John Keefe.  `Rave to the Grave' is about the high school students who survived the terrible zombie outbreak in the previous film. They are now college students and this time one of them finds a dusty canister in the attic, but instead of leaving it alone or reporting to the police, he and his friends take a sample of the slimy liquid inside and bring it to the laboratory in the campus. And ... here is the silliest part ... one student makes a drug called `Z' out of the sample and starts to sell it on campus.  `Rave to the Grave" relies on this silly one-joke idea about the zombie drug that not only makes people act like zombies, but actually turns them into real ones. The film runs out of steam halfway through the story, and the rest of it is about the repetitious battles between zombies and humans that are neither thrilling nor funny to see. Two `Men-in-Black'-like hitmen are added to the humorless story of teenager zombie attack, but their downbeat humor does not work with the weak and pointless direction that fails to make the entire film a real gorefest or campy fun.  The only good thing about the film is you can see Tarman Zombie, but only briefly. Except for one mildly amusing scene, he has nothing to do in the film. He appears and stays out of the film most of the time. This is definitely the worst film in the `Return of the Living Dead' series, and probably nearly as bad as the notorious "House of the Dead.+dvd
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY+N+I AM A BIG FAN OF " AMERICAN ME "  " BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT " ETC. BUT THIS ONE JUST TOTALLY SUCKED!!! IT HAS REALLY CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND THE STORY IS WELL NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH " SCARFACE " " GOODFELLAS" " GOD FATHER " TRAFFIC " CARLITOS WAY " BLOW " 21 GRAMS " TRAINING DAY "   JUST TO SAME A FEW+dvd
If you love Livvy.....+P+Ok, so this movie was a flop...story is kind of silly, but if you LOVE ONJ like I do, you will enjoy this!  Livvy is beautiful as always in this movie and her music was great too!  Yeah, I agree with the other reviews, it is a "Hall of Shamer" but, us die-hard ONJ fans still like watching her! +dvd

Almost ANYTHING with Casper in it other than "Starship Troopers" is usually horrible...this film seemed OK I mean it has Rod Steiger and Kim Catrall in it!!! I figured it would be a B movie and be "fun" but in the end its just BAAAAAD....Its not witty like Lost Boys nor fun like "John Carpenter's Vampires".....The film tries too hard to be funny at times and shlocky when it comes off very amatuerish. Simply this is just a real waste of money and time..+dvd

Queen of the Damned+P+OMG! How can i begin to descibe the sexiness of LESTAT! (Stewart Townsend) He's like the hottest 500yr old ever! You don't have to love VAMPIRES to love this film. Lestat (Townsend) is a rebellious loner type vampire who is fed up with living in the shadows of eternity and wants to live out in the open of the 21st century. So he does what anyone who wants to be heard, known and worshiped would do... he becomes a rock star. It's there in his new found fame and fortune that he catches the eye of a young woman named Jesse. She becomes facinated with Lestat and the dark relm he lives in. Then theres the competition, Akasha,(R&B singer Aaliyah) the Queen of all who are damned. Aaliyah gives a grand performance as this "take no crap from any human or fanged fiend" mother of vampires everywhere. This movie is the latest in the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. It is not set in the 1400's but it does give tales of the old and the new. It's a great flick pick for a Friday night with any kind of company, the living or the undead. +dvd
Enjoyable Backstager+P+If you overlook the dreary Hedy Lamarr plot, there's a lot to savor in this picture:   Garland's singing, of course, which includes an early and very funny bit of self-parody when she belts the "showstopper" version of "I'm Only Chasing Rainbows." Note the look on Garland's face when papa/vaudeville veteran Charles Winninger orders her to "Give it all you've got!" Judy seems about to say, "Well, you asked for it..." My only disappointment is that she is assigned the negligible tune "Minnie from Trinidad" as her 11 o'clock number.  Lana Turner's performance as a gone-to-hell-in-a-handbasket showgirl/boozer. Campiest moment in the film is when JUDY is assigned to keep Lana sober! Lana's final promenade down the stairs (to yet one more reprise of "You Walked Out of a Dream") is worth the price of the DVD -- this is what star quality is all about.  There are also some very funny bits from Edward Everett Horton and Eve Arden -- which made me wonder why La Arden didn't turn up among all the other ladies in THE WOMEN, lensing at Metro about the same time as this pic.  Oh, and one other thing: do you notice that this film has almost the identical plot to VALLEY OF THE DOLLS -- with Lana in the Neely O'Hara part+dvd
Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion+N+First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake.  Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm.  That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?"  This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism+dvd
A diamond from the diamond+P+I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and as a result didn't buy Major League III for more than a year. I'm sorry about that, because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution, and casting.   In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, and we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, and whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). Still the second film was enjoyable and worth having, even with these issues.   So, I expected a lower budget, poorer result with Major League III, and boy, I was wrong. New characters and a new situations develop, and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine. The music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun (like when the villan manager of the Twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball). All the new characters carry off their roles extremely well, and all in all I think you should NOT skip this one if you like the series at all.     +dvd
So clever and intelligent+P+This is a clever film with an imaginative layering of stories, with a central historical thrust that is disturbing but important to hear about.+dvd
The Presidio DVD+P+This is a fabulous movie.  I have it on video and decided to replace the video with DVD.  Sean Connery, Meg Ryan, and Mark Harmon are amoung my favorite actors and actresses, so to get a great movie with all three of them in it, is a real bonus. Dee Moffat Port Angeles, W+dvd
Continuing The Downward Spiral Of What Was Once A Good Franchise.+N+Dean Winters, doing his best impression of Ben Affleck, stars in this, the sixth installment in the constantly withering "Hellraiser" franchise. In "Hellraiser: Hellseeker," his character, Trevor Gooden is married to good ol' Kirsty Cotton, who we remember from the first three films. Trouble is, she seemingly dies in a car wreck less than ten minutes into the movie and Trevor has one massive headache trying to figure out what happened.  Let it be known that history does repeat itself. Just like "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth" and "Hellraiser: Bloodline," this one takes the series further into shame and embarassment. It's a direct-to-video sequel, but c'mon, we expect better than this. Maybe "Hellseeker" was a good script at some point, but when they decided to throw Pinhead and Kirsty into the mix, it got lost. See, these characters serve little to no purpose in the plot. They are just gimmicks, placed within a story to draw in viewers and feed off a legendary title. This is not a "Hellraiser" movie. A healthy chunk of it just adds up to a sub-standard psychological thriller, nothing else. In fact, Pinhead and Kirsty hardly come into play until the final 15 minutes, which feel like a remake of the original movie.  I like to think I have an open mind when it comes to movies, and horror in particular. But this movie is a joke. The producers obviously masked an incomplete script to pass it off as a "Hellraiser" movie (ala "American Psycho 2") and shouldn't think for one second that we can't tell the difference. The end result is full of plot-holes, loose ends, inconsistencies, etc. etc. If you can make any sense out what you saw or if you can even call it a movie at the very end, you're a better person than me+dvd
You will LOVE it!!!+P+The Art of Knitting and Crochet 2 was my first introduction to crocheting. It made learning to crochet really really easy. Everytihng is shot nice and close and Nancy Brown's demos are right on point. You'll make some fun stuff with this dvd...it's great if you love to knit and are always on the lookout for additional knitting projects and are interested in learning to how to crochet. I love this dvd and I know you will too!!+dvd
Wonderful Doris down on the farm+P+Cute, warm & funny.  Not the funniest sitcom ever, but who cares.  Doris Day is something we'll never see again. A true original.  She rocks+dvd
Lagrimas of boredom+N+Boring, derivative and very mildly amusing. Almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago! I couldn't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes. The only positive comment I have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of Mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in Mexican movies, at least those imported in the USA.+dvd
This is why sequels have such a bad reputation+N+The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...  No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.  Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.  So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again+dvd
Ambush Bay -- not art+N+Ambush Bay is not art.  It is not entertainment.  It is not even interesting. Ambush Bay is without a doubt one of the worst WWII movies ever produced.  The best part of this movie is Robert Mitchum's red cap, worn while he is in the Philippine jungle hiding from Japanese soldiers.  Red cap....  Why not wear universal orange?  I've seen the movie twice.  Once with the sound on.  It was awful.  I watched it again, with the sound off.  It was better this second time.  It had the feel, without sound, of an ok comedy.  With the sound it was pathetic.  Don't both buying it.  Spend your money on something more useful or entertaining. +dvd
I Luv this movie+P+I loved this movie even as a child but i only rememeber bits and pieces of it and i couldn't remember the title and drove myself CRAZY trying to find it and finaly i did!!! i'm so happy+dvd
Terrible.Terrible movie, Avoid this one at all costs+N+P.U.N.K.S. is a very bad movie even for a Disney channel movie. A boy is feeling neglected after his dad dosen't make it to his party and then finds his father is making a suit that is a robotic suit for a evil boss that walks with a crow on his shoulder. This is by far the WORST movie of the 1990s next to Titanic. This movie is only for kids and idiots because this movie is awful. Even Randy Quaid and Henry Winkler were embarrassed to be in this mess. If you want a good Disney channel movie watch The Paper Brigade. The only good part was the credits+dvd
Disappointing+N+These Bean cartoons are to comedy what cardboard is to cookies. The humour found in identifying with the live Mr. Bean is lost in simple crude cartooning and wishy-washy colors.  Not even the occasional grunt from Atkinson brings these boring drawings and predictable story-lines to life. Not watchable, even by great fans of Bean or by children+dvd
0 STARS: And this movie really, really, really deserves 0 stars!!+N+"An American Werewolf in Paris" is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever observed.  Don't even try to compare this to the classic "An American Werewolf in London".  This movie is about as scary as "The Naked Gun", the acting is pathetic and the plot for this movie is horrible...I can not even bear to rehash it to you. There is nothing creepy or remotely scary about this movie...it is just plain stupid.   Also, the werewolves in this movie look like some kind of a joke.  I tried to keep an open mind, but basically, I could barely finish this movie and the best thing about it was when it was over and I did not have to watch anymore.  Total waste of time.  I mean basically, this movie is a total "ZERO" and my recommendation to you is not to even think of wasting your time on this flick. +dvd
Funny Movie+P+"Meatballs" is Bill Murray's movie.  He makes it work.  From beginning to end he gives us a non-stop stream of funny lines and crazy antics.  I believe we're seeing him (Murray) at his peak here.  He's not funny at all these days, but back in the 70s he was the funniest person in the entertainment industry, and in "Meatballs" he is at the top of his game.  I would pick Bill Murray (at his peak) over Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, or Robin Williams.    The story ... your basic summer camp situation ... is brought to life and made hilarious.  Bill leads the way, but he does get some help.  The supporting cast is actually pretty good.  They were well chosen for their respective roles, and are believable and likable.  Chris Makepeace,the "short depressed kid we ordered" is very effective as the sensative camper who is shunned by the other campers.  Jack Blum, as Spaz, is excellent.  I think the creation of the Spaz character is a stroke of movie genius, and Jack makes the part work ... making me wonder if maybe he is that way in real life.  Kristine DeBell is very nice as the counselor A.L. ... very likable.  Bill Murray handles the funny guy role (who is actually a caring guy) with ease.  His scenes with Chris Makepeace are very real, very touching ... and, whether he wanted to or not, Bill gave quite a bit of depth to the Tripper character.  The humor does, at times, cross over the line into questionable taste.  For some reason though, when Bill Murray makes a dirty joke, we are not offended.  It's as if we know he's only bluffing and is not really that way.  Personally, I think his clean material is better than that stuff, but if we want Bill Murray, I guess we have to take the whole package ... and we get a wide variety of humor here.  But the movie is funny and entertaining ... beginning to end.  And it holds up well under repeated viewing.        +dvd
The cave in+N+What a disaster. Don't waste your time with this one. Nothing grabs you in the beginning, the plot(if any) is poor, and yes there are some nice sets, but that doesn't make a good movie.+dvd
Worst movie ever...voice sounds like he has cancer!+N+This was the worst Seagal movie ever made...It was confusing, dark, stupid plot and they made his voice sound like the Marlboro man with cancer.  I used to love his movies but if this is the stuff he is now making he is all washed up.  He fights like a old man in the movie too...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...Too Bad...he used to be great+dvd
Baby Einstein DVDs Are Some of Worst Baby DVSs! +N+I have bought 30+ baby/infant DVDS from different production companies, such as the "So Smart" series, the "Brainy Baby" series, the "Your Baby Can Read!" series, and the Nite Light ABC DVD. Baby Einstein DVDs are the lowest in quality, cheap toy props, boring music, nothing stimulating.  I would recommend the So Smart DVDs and the Brainy Baby DVDs.  Your Baby Can Read! are OK, not very high tech, but it could work.  +dvd
HOOYAH! THIS IS THE MOTHER LODE+P+Freddie Francis, Terence Fisher, Phil Leaky and all the crew! What more could you possibly want?  Are you a Hammer Fan?  Get this video, buy the popcorn, and enjoy yourself to the max! It's a technicolor orgy, and a fiendish festival.  You will thank yourself for purchasing this collection many times over+dvd
Oh So Sincere, Oh So Bad!+N+Stanley Kramer was a competent filmmaker who had a progressive, liberal  point of view, often way before it was fashionable, on almost all social issues. It's hard to look at some of his films today without groaning, but they are all well meaning, if often way past gooey. Except for "Judgement At Nuremberg" and maybe "Inherit the Wind", all of them seem badly dated. The worst of the lot, "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" is almost unwatchable.  The screenplay by Leonard Rose (which,unbelivably, won an Academy Award!)seems out of step even for the 60's. The plot is ludicrous and patronizing;the biracial couple is so perfect one would think they landed from another planet. Did Mr. Poitier HAVE to be a doctor? Why not president? There is never the slightest doubt as to what is going to happen next in this film. All of the characters are stock, the storyline totally predictable and banal.  For those suffering from A.D.D., poor Spencer Tracy gives a nice, long, sweet speech at the end which summarizes, verbatim, everything you've just had to suffer through the past hour and a half.  The acting, except for Beah Richards, is uniformly bad (though with this story no one,not even Mr. Tracy, has a chance to do anything other than be cute).Ms. Houghten was pretty but talently challenged.Ms. Hepburn is especially dreadful in what is actually a rather small part. This was the start of the teary eyes,quivering chin (I am NOT referring to her neurological disorder!), "Oh,I KNOW you all love me!" phase of her career. Her eyes are very slanty in this film and one can see the scars of a recent face lift when she is seen in profile. Her close ups are all sort of hazy; kind of like Lucille Ball in "Mame". Ms. Hepburn always seemed strong and proud and unbeatable when she was younger, or at least until, "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner". Athough always somewhat actressy and prone to posing, she was always smart and likable and sometimes very effective, especially in comedies. I don't know why she chose to go down the saccharine path as she got older.   It's very sad that Mr. Tracy (the most spendid and natural screen actor of his time) had to end his distinguished career in this embarrassing pile of glop. I immediately watched "Woman of the Year" and "Adam's Rib" after viewing "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" so I would remember how wonderful almost all of the other Tracy/Hepburn movies were.+dvd
Blues Deluxe+P+What's not to like about LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE?  You can scarcely argue with its roster of talent.  It features Odetta, Ruth Brown, B.B. King, Solomon Burke, Shamekia Copeland, Dr. John, , Buddy Guy, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Honeyboy Edwards, Shamekia Copeland, Mavis Staples, Robert Cray, Keb Mo, Bonnie Raitt...the list goes on. Natalie Cole was bluesier than I ever would have imagined. As were Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. I'd seen David Johansen in his blues incarnation, so I wasn't surprised by his transition from New York Doll to Buster Poindexter to bluesman. Also very good were some folks I'd heard of, but had never heard: India.Arie, Angelique Kidjo. I wasn't as impressed by rapper Chuck D. although his anti-war version of "Boom Boom" certainly had its heart in the right place. John Fogerty's version of "Midnight Special," which he had recorded with CCR, didn't really bring anything new to the song, but it was pretty good. Macy Gray, doing "Hound Dog," was better than I'd expected too. I've found her voice a little irritating on some of the songs I've heard of hers, but it's hard to go wrong with a straight ahead tune like "Hound Dog."   See it with someone you love. Or alone....but if you care about the blues as an art form, do see it+dvd
nasty nasty+N+First off she is in a gay bar if my eyes weren't decieving me. Thats where she met the man to watch her when she was unwatchable. If you like nasty crap to watch i recommend this for you. I don't want to give away any of the movie sceens and ruin your experience, but i will say this much she starts her period, and he gets a taste.....this is in french, but it does have english subtitles. I am referring to the DVD.+dvd
The Best of Many+P+Victor Hugo's novel has been filmed so many times, with excellent actors donning the hump: Lon Chaney, Anthony Quinn, and Anthony Hopkins are a few examples that spring to mind. However, the crude 'animalistic' behaviour and the pathos that Charles Laughton brings to his performance is wonderful, for at no time can the audience feel any sentiment for this Quasimodo. He is a horror with a human soul. While Cedric Hardwicke is a horror that pretends to have a soul.  It is very easy to enthuse and celebrate the film, simply because it is wonderful to watch for its sets and, therefore, its art direction, photography, and design. The reason it was not heaped with Oscars is simple: it is one of the 'Great Films' of 1939.  Let us go back to the actors. Cedric Hardwicke has never been as smooth a villain, he is as Frollo is evil. Maureen O'Hara in her first film may not be the ideal for a gypsy maid, but she does show what would become her strengths: independence from, and yet a dependence for men... Edmond O'Brien as Pierre shows his great talent (probably one of the best screen actors ever, he played a different person in each role, you could not type cast him). Thomas Mitchell as The King of Thieves is smart and in this film extremely dangerous.  Another thing that the production did with understated talent was show a Europe moving from Medieval to Renassiance existence.  If there is a fault with this film: it is simple. It has a happy ending.+dvd
What the Italian family is all about+P+(My copy is a Region 2, European version). A masterpiece by Italian director Lucino Visconti. Intense, emotional, realistic, passionate, dramatic story of an Italian family from the poor south (Lucania) who immigrates to the northern city of Napoli.  A 3-hour film that, alternatively, focuses on each one of the sons of the 'mamma'. If "Il Gattopardo" was the drama of the aristocratic Italian family from the south, this one corresponds to the poor family also from the south. Both are cinematic gems, worthy of being included among the best in film history. Although a long film, its intensity never diminishes. Every shot is full of emotion and meaningful and beautiful.  The only thing that disappointed me a little was the way it ended, the last half-hour. It's more of an open ending, no conclusion.  One of the most gorgeous films in b/w that I've seen. Italy to the bones.+dvd
this movie is trash+N+this movie was soooo boring and not only that put even the ending didn't put means to the movie what a waste of seeing hte movie or even renting it trash+dvd
best buy+P+My daughter is three months old and has been discovering/watching these DVD's since she was two weeks old.  I didn't think she would pay any attention to them but she loves them!  She sit's in her bouncy seat and we watch them together.  She coos and smiles at all of the animals and kicks her feet to the music.  Well worth the money!!!!!!!!+dvd
A post-modern revision of  Scooby-Doo...+N+I just had the chance to watch this film, and I was pretty sickened by the approach the writers took to this material.  Apparently, someone felt that the classic "mystery" approach which the Scooby-Doo franchise had leaned on for the past several decades had grown stale, and so the writers and producers decided to throw away the formula which had made Scooby-Doo so popular, and re-cast this storyline into a cliche-ridden horror film more akin to "Night of the Living Dead".  The writers go out of their way to mock the previous incarnations of the cartoon, pointing out time and again how all of the "monsters" which the Scooby-gang had encountered in the past had been men in monster suits.  On this outing, the monsters they meet have no tricks.  They are REAL.  Real zombies, real ghosts, real voodoo priestesses.  Along with all this so-called 'realism' are disturbing situations and terror, including graphic depictions of beheadings, torsos being ripped apart, and a scene where a group of peaceful farmers are herded into a crocodile-infested swamp by a bloodthirsty band of pirates, where they are eaten.  It's not shown, but the quick cut away leaves little to the imagination with all the off-screen screaming.  In short, this is a serious mis-step in the Scooby-Doo mythos, with the Scooby-gang at first cocky and assured that there are hidden wires or holographic projectors creating the monsters, only to grow more terrified and helpless as it's revealed that the horrors are not created, but actual.  The writer's attempt to inject some educational value into the proceedings seems to be limited to indentifying the vast amounts of regional food that Scooby and Shaggy are constantly gorging themselves on.    The insinuation that monsters like this are real is subversive and not appropriate for the age group that these cartoons are aimed at.  Not recommended, unless you're an older viewer who's curious about the whole "what if" factor involved.  The animation and other factors are all good, for this kind of direct-to-video product, and there are some brief moments of winking humor that long-time fans will quickly pick up on+dvd
Silly and Cheap Dino-Flick from the Director of 'Commando'+N+Somewhere in Turkey, there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby. To this place come one American professor who needs to publish a paper, one graduate student as assistant (and love interest), and four naïve undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college. Deep in this forest, moreover, a group of terrorists are hiding, and the US special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive. (But do American college students need to fly all the way to Turkey to graduate? Travel financed by one of the rich student's daddy?)  Part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of `Predator,' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur `Pterodactyl' - no, in fact, pterodactyls, to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, however, the creatures in `Pterodactyl' only bore you to death because of their cheesy CGI and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story. The film is not scary, nor exciting even with occasional gore, and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games, what can you expect from the rest of the film's 90 minutes?  Coolio is the captain of the special unit, and his acting itself is not bad. But at the same time, I am afraid, not many people would find the idea of Coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing, and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination. The other actors are not great either, but with this bad story and dialogues, and most of all very unconvincing creatures, none one can be blamed.  The saddest thing is that the director is Mark L. Lester, who once did the underrated action film `Commando' back in 1985 with Schwarzenegger. That was a ridiculous story, but I really liked the way Schwarzenegger's hero talked and behaved (throwing a telephone booth!). It was silly, but it was fun. `Pterodactyl' is silly, and tries to be fun, which you know it is not+dvd
A Compelling Performance+P+Having been a fan of Rigoletto for many years, I ordered this DVD based mostly on Placido Domingo's participation. Having watched it now, I have found it to be a rewarding performance. Domingo's Duke is very gratifying. Macneil's Rigoletto is vocally weaker, but his stage presence is powerful. On the whole his performance is effective as Rigoletto. I'm glad to have the DVD and expect to enjoy it many times+dvd
2 1/2 stars !  this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected!+N+Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!)+dvd
"I ain't afraid of no ghosts"+P+Ivan Reitman's 1984 mega-hit, and it's lesser sequel, are both included in this double feature DVD gift set that long time fans of the Ghostbusters should consider an absolute must own.  Chances are you already know the story: three bumbling scientists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis) lose their campus jobs and go into business for themselves.  Only thing is, their business involves capturing and containing gross and slimy ghosts throughout New York.  Also featuring Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, and Rick Moranis; Ghostbusters ended up being a super hit which spawned an animated series, tons of toys, and a sequel five years later.  Ghostbusters 2, while nowhere near as wonderful as the first film but still pretty fun, finds the guys back in business as a new breed of evil is about to be birthed in time for New Years.  Although this isn't the first time both films have appeared on DVD, there's enough special features here to make this Gift Set worth picking up.  There's a nice selection of deleted scenes (nothing substancial), a couple featurettes, and commentary from Reitman and co., but there's no features devoted to Ghostbusters 2.  Instead, there are two animated episodes that are linked to the two films, and there's an exclusive scrap book included too with a nice variety of information for fans.  If you've already been double dipped by the Ghostbusters on DVD, picking this up is entirely up to you.  However, if you're a fan of these films and don't own them on DVD, pick this affordable Gift Set up and enjoy+dvd
Not for DVD aficionados+N+I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now+dvd
It made me hot too!+P+That Jason Jordan has it exactly right. This is a homo-epic of astounding proportions, as indeed were one or two of the delicious young men in the movie. I'd give this thousands of stars if I could, because that's all I can see after playing along with this DVD for 10 minutes or so..+dvd
*Re-living  Back In The Days*+P+The movie was awesome. It had a great story line. Also it takes you back to the late 70's and the early 80's. Spike Lee definitly did a good job with the clothing, the scenary, and the music. It is a great family movie+dvd
JohnyGluebag+N+****this review is NOT for the superbit version***** The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.  Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on?  It would help out+dvd
A stunning masterpiece of a movie+P+I'm going to keep it short and sweet: A complex plot that's easy to follow. Beautiful locations. Crisp screenwriting. Crack acting. Sexy. Intellectual. Warm.  You get the feeling that the actors and crew were transformed by the act of working on this movie+dvd
Vulgar and Offensive+N+Before I begin the review, I should take time to mention that I am a huge baseball fan. I rarely miss a game, follow it as if my life depends on it, and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than I do movies. I also played when I was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater.  I had heard that Bull Durham was one of the best, if not the best, baseball movies ever made. As a fan of Field of Dreams and The Natural, I decided to go and rent this one. Figuring that it was about baseball I thought I couldn't go wrong, so I didn't check the ratings on any of the sites as I normally do for a movie. Big mistake on my part there.  I couldn't even make it through a half hour of this movie. There was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning. The entire thing was about sex, and I had to look away from the TV for some time. I was hoping it would get better but it never did, and after all the sex and foul language I stopped the movie, never bothering to finish it.  I was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings. Looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie, it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters, who I did not like at all, seemed to persist. Unfortunately this movie is filled with sex, and I feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release.  I'm not some kid writing this, I am a mature conservative Christian. This movie should offend anyone who believes in Him. Don't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one. Go and watch a real baseball game--always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment, plus it's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be+dvd
A Treasure Returned to the Catalogue+P+To the best of my knowledge, this is the first DVD featuring Renata Scotto although I would be delighted to be proved wrong (please reissue a Tokyo Lucia with Bergonzi). The only other DVD (with June Anderson)is hardly in the same league so perhaps I should have rated it five stars!  My only negative is the very dated production; it clearly shows its age, especially aesthetically although I would be hard put to suggest how it should be staged.  Suffice it to say that it works and with Scotto and Domingo the emphasis is clearly on the singing and they deliver in spades. It is ironic that Verdi didn't give his title soprano an aria that had been excerpted and sung by sopranos of the past whereas the tenor has the glorious aria that has be recorded countless times in the days of 78's and LP recitals.  Needless to say Domingo garners the greatest ovation.  Milnes was clearly an audience favorite (if not one of mine)and there is no doubting his committment to the role both in his aria and the wonderful duets with Scotto.  It is somewhat ironic that Milnes and Domingo are roughly contemporaries while Domingo continues to sing (albeit a reduced and different repertory)and Milnes career started to fade a number of years ago.  Ordinarily baritones can enjoy longer careers than tenors, but in this case.....  Scotto is a treasure; the DVD should be required viewing and studying for any one who aspires to the repertoire.  It was late in her career yet she is savvy enough to know how to capitalize on her strengths and minimize the weaknesses.  Her attention to text is an object lesson and of course it helps that she is Italian, but she animates every phrase she sings, does nothing that is superfluous.  I saw her only once, a Butterfly in San Francisco in the 70's; it was a glorious performance.  But then she is a glorious artist+dvd
Classic+P+I felt sorry for that poor man in the wheel chair, when he did all that for something he wasn't involved in..+dvd
Yow!+N+This is the film that could easily have tanked the career of lesser mortals, but the mighty Jane Fonda continued acting in six or seven subsequent films until 1992, when she married Ted Turner and her film career ended rather abruptly.  Kris Kristofferson is simply awful/laugable in his role as a Wall Street Troubleshooter.   Don't look for this mess to be released on dvd anytime soon, unless it becomes a camp favorite.  This film tries to be a potboiler, but it ends up being a soap opera with the world economy as a backdrop. It's one establishing shot after another, and the actual consequences of any actual conflict are too abstract for anyone to care about.  Fonda and Kristofferson must have been embarrassed at this thing.  It's just a sheer waste of two good actors.  The plotline is so paper thin that even a kid in second grade would find it to be implausible.  In fact, here's a script for a story that I wrote in about three minutes, which would have made more sense:  "Heroes of the Stratosphere" by Thomas Redmond  After taxiing down an airport runway near San Clemente, California, Jane Fonda and Kris Kristofferson take off in a badly-maintained twin engine biplane with Jane Fonda piloting.  At 6,000 feet, Jane decides to put the plane through its paces, and begins performing aerial stunts like barrel rolls and steep power dives.  Unfortunately, the airplane is not in very good shape and after about ten minutes, part of the left wing flies off.    "Hey!," yells Kristofferson. "Hey, Yourself!," yells Fonda, coyly. "Yow!," replies Kristofferson.  At that point, Fonda manuevers the biplane into a tailspin, and Kristofferson flies out of his seat, into the air and begins to fall to earth without a parachute.  Then, in an attempt to save Kristofferson by scooping him into the navigator's seat, Fonda puts the plane into a steep dive but is unable to rescue the hapless Kris because of the damaged left wing. Fonda ends up crashing the airplane into a Lake near the DuPont estate near Wilmington, Delaware about a half an hour after takeoff.  Somehow, both Kris and Jane emerge from the experience unscathed.  Later on the two are reunited and they get married and live happily ever after.   The End+dvd
Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion+N+First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake.  Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm.  That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?"  This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism+dvd
TALE OF THE DANCING NOSE-HAIRS+N+"Camelot" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on.  But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included "If Ever I Would Leave You" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet.  Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest.  Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry.  Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side.  Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors.  And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, "Arthur get thy wife a hankie,+dvd
just the way i like my bond...+P+Look people..its a Bond movie..movie loaded with 2 hours of action,explosions, cgi and hot women,this movie will give your sound system a workout, yeah some action scenes leave you doubting the realism but its BOND, get over it..GOLDENEYE still my favorit+dvd
Should have been left in the Sahara+N+Well, this won't take very long.  Warning!  Spoiler here!  Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation.  Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation.  One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing.  Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara.  Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake.    Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that.  Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time.+dvd
one of jackie's best+P+This is a really enjoyable film.  The action is great, the comic timing perfect, the stunts amazing.   I'm stumped by how Hollywood can decide to release Twin Dragons when there are such great Jackie classics as Project A  1 and 2, Drunken Master 1 and 2, Police Story 1 and 2+dvd
really good movie+P+It's a really good movie. I'm from Japan so I felt same things in the US several months ago. So, I can understand it. maybe, if you have never been to other countries, it's hard to understand this movie. overall, this is a really good movie+dvd
This thing is junk but my kid loves it+N+My 33 month old loves it - it's junk, the production quality is weak, and the "story" is lame but my kid loves it. I think it was a great value given how many times he's watched it+dvd
Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining+N+Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so+dvd

BUYER BEWARE+N+I GIVE A 1 STAR TO THE DVD'S NOT THE MOVIES. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW COLLECTOR'S BOX SET COMING OUT SOON. READ BELOW. Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial). Thanks to Bits reader Matt K. for the heads-up on this.+dvd
Dissappointingly shrill+N+The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them.  This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed "The Age of Innocence," with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available+dvd
Superior Concert Video+P+This is by far the best concert video I own.  The Stones were on top of their game at this St. Louis concert, soulful, bluesy, and rocking.  The cameras stay on the band the whole time, unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience.  The sound is CD quality, the picture and color is vivid, the editing is tight.  The highlight for me is Keith Richards' "I Wanna Hold You" and some incredible versions of many classics.  The songs from the Bridges to Babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire.  The fact of the matter is the Stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts.    I highly recommend this DVD.  It is superior to the Four Flicks, and a lot less expensive.  Five Stars+dvd
Preplay-review revised+P+I haven't played this game yet, but from everything that I've seen I want to. I am writing this in reply to one of the others writing a review, and to let someone who wants this and decides not to get it because of their review. He said is was short and had a weird ending. Thats because it's not the ending. If you notice it's call Sin Episodes. There are going to be about seven of them. What's great is that, if you get injured, it will carry over to the next one. If you haven't deleted you save games.+dvd
Waste of a talented cast+N+What a disappointment. Every single character in this film is depressed, mentally ill, and self-absorbed. No one is sane or sympathetic. Therefore, there's no one to identify with or root for. No one gets better or grows as a person. So what's the point? Annette Benning gives a strong performance, but her character is vapid and self-pitying. Not worth two hours of your life+dvd
Clint is the man in Joe Kidd+P+This is one of my favorite Eastwood movies and what Clint said is the perfect western. In typical stoic fashion Eastwood outsmarts, outshoots and out-cools the badguys at every turn.  I put this one somewhere just below The Good the bad and the ugly, but higher than Eastwoods recent work like Unforgiven where he seems to have lost his moral compass and confidence+dvd
The Four Feather Bore+N+Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time+dvd
Satire on the Revival Business+P+This film shows a 1920 speakeasy. Elmer Gantry is feeling no pain, and walks around to collect money on Christmas Eve for the Salvation Army. His sleaziness and dishonesty are quite apparent. After hopping a freight train, he jumps off to avoid being robbed. He seems to live without working, just going from town to town. [A crooked gambler or a confidence man?] Next he shows up at a revival meeting, where a young woman preaches and passes buckets for donations. [Is this entertainment before radio and movies?] Elmer's attempt to meet Sister Sharon Falconer is rebuffed; she knows the type.  Can a salesman switch to a new line of products? [Many say it's the personality not the product.] Elmer's speech is quite popular with the audience. But what makes him give up smoking and drinking? Or inspire his speeches? There is another scene where a member of the audience begins to bark! Revivals grew out of the rural frontier, where people gathered like at a social event. A revival in Zenith can bring in church members, converts, donations, and publicity. But the revival company needs a guarantee to cover their fixed costs. [No one thinks of cutting costs.] George Babbitt explains why they must fill the churches - so people won't be tempted by other diversions (like politics). Sister Sharon's speech moves the crowd. It's a successful social event.  The film shows how the press can turn public opinion against the revival meeting. [No mention of their hidden agenda.] There is an interesting philosophical conversation in the editor's office. Elmer shows his dialectical skills; he learned rhetoric at his seminary school. God's will brought Sister Sharon to Zenith, she will be able to build her tabernacle. There is a large amount of Populism in his speech; he attacked powerful corporations. [Rural farmers were hit by the Depression in 1921.] Elmer's call for popular revolt seems quite radical. He leads an attack on a speakeasy, then a brothel. Local gambling dens are overlooked.  Elmer's past catches up with him: a blonde in a hotel room. This is a trap to photograph him in the act, a trick often used against reformers. They ask for a huge amount in blackmail, and for Sharon to deliver the cash. The publication of the photos are a front page scandal. Attendance drops off. Some rowdies show up to create a disturbance. [Did shutting down local vice hurt the wallets of the local ruling class?] A man who went deaf suddenly appears. After Sister Sharon lays her hands on him and calls for his healing. It works! [No ringer here.] But a discarded cigarette causes a fire and a panic. Is this the work of a devil? No fire regulations? Sister Sharon leaves for a better world. [I don't know if this film is true to the book. It is a good story, but the ending seems weak.]  Why did people in rural areas turn to revivalism? 1921 saw the beginning of the Great Depression for them. Other organizations like the Populists or the Socialists were suppressed, their leaders jailed. Religion was the only way they could assemble together without being stopped. That is why the corporations were against them.+dvd
The movie that started the modern American mafia genera+P+The Godfather set the American Mafia movie genera. A good plot line with a tight scrip, superb direction and well acted. There are many murders, after all this is about gangsters but why it's rated "R" is beyond me. It's way less gruesome with less disturbing violence than Casino and many modern MA films are much more violent.  The power plays, honour and business scheming between the Mafia families give the framework of the film with personal trial and tribulations providing more depth for the character development that echo throughout the genera ever since and make The Godfather repeatedly watchable.  I wanted a copy for a present and after spending months looking for a copy in the retail shops without success, I found this widescreen version at a great price on Amazon within seconds and, I ended up keeping it.  +dvd
A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys+P+Well I have the VHS edition and I say this concert is great. The only thing is I'm more of a funk man and I prefer Homecoming Live in Orlando+dvd
another escape piece+P+This movie is cute and intelligently presented. It is an old film, yet an escape for some young people who are overwhelmed with so much talk about war in the world. Broderick does an excellent job of portraying a typical teenager, wanting to play and try different computer games, coming across something larger than life.+dvd
Disappointing...+N+A beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting. Russell Crowe shouldn't try the Hugh Grant shtick! The movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into Hollywood's story template mire. Hollywood won't take any chances, it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over. Hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises, are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before. You know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes. The only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and Albert Finney's performance. He commands your attention, fills the screen with his acting. A superb performance. Many have said it is the new "French Kiss". Though the story lines are similar, the direction and character development in "French Kiss" was much better. Kevin Kline's acting and character development were excellent. If you want to see this genre done really well, watch the film "Mostly Martha" directed and written by Sandra Nettelbeck. No, it's not about Martha Stewart. "A Good Year" would have been a much better film in her hands+dvd
It Was a Great Time+P+I thought the 2005 World Series Collector's Edition was really terrific.  I enjoyed every second of it.  It really caught all the emotion and suspense of four great ball games.  This is one I will be watching over and over again.  Anyone who is a fan of baseball and particularly a fan of the Chicago White Sox will want to have this collector's edition.  The 2005 World Series was a great one+dvd
How could you not like this film?+P+When a film is a horror/epic/monster/romance/martial arts/period film...what is not to like? if genre-bending films upset you then you won't like it. This movie is for everyone with an open mind. "Brotherhood of the Wolf" takes you places, and it's directed and acted very well. Great action, acting, and special effects. I like to keep my reviews on the shorter side, and this one is no different...check it out it is worth the money. +dvd
I can barely hear Chuck+N+I have to contradict the other review.  I thought it was shot fine, but the sound was not good.  Moe is a two guitar band and I believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other.  On the DVD, Al is real loud, but Chuck's guitar is almost completely inaudible.  This is a real big disappointment to me.  I really like moe, but I would not recomend this DVD except for those who have to have it.  It's a real shame+dvd
Dreams and Magical Realities+P+Sharkboy and Lavagirl is like a painting without 3D glasses. Put on the glasses and you experience a magical reality where dreams change your world and where the challenge is to overcome the nightmares.   This movie is as much about facing fears and positive thinking as it is about special effects. It is especially impressive in this regard, with witty dialogue and spontaneous and unexpected turns of event.   I found Lavagirl to be a beautiful character with a loving heart and playful outlook on life. She sometimes forgets her powers and they use this for comic effect. She seems a little lost at first, as if seeking her greater purpose all while enjoying a playful combative interchange with Sharkboy.   The scenes take place in a school and in a magical dream reality. The characters move from real life to dreams in an instant and you can fall asleep and dream up a new reality in your dreams. It is all very fun and I found myself laughing throughout at the innocent humor and creative surprises. I think adults will get the "brainstorm" joke even more than children would and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids to enjoy. I also thought there were some amazingly profound moments during the conversations and if you realize what it would take to say those lines to someone who is a bully, that in itself should impress.   On the fun visual side, lands of cookies and milk present culinary adventures as Lavagirl, Sharkboy and Daydreamer Max float through a world on a huge chocolate chip cookie. Then you have a volcano and worlds of imagination reminiscent of a theme park ride. There is a mildy dark nemesis who is the bully and he aggravates the situation by appearing in Max's dreams. He steals Max's diary. I loved that Max had a dream journal and how reading through the journal/diary made his dreams come true. Changing the dreams, changed the settings and this presents the challenge.   The amazing thing about this movie is how it was inspired by a child's imagination and when you watch the extras, I think you will be even more impressed. I would love to see more movies like this because it reminds me of the hope we have as children and how we can still dream our worlds into life as adults. I think this movie gives children an empowering message and to be honest, some of the issues discussed in this movie could change a child's world for the better. Max is a great role model and his actions speak of a wisdom far beyond his years. As Max learns to navigate his own imagination, he is really teaching children amazing lessons about how to navigate life.   Highly Recommended along with the 3D glasses!   ~The Rebecca Review+dvd
Fantasy for Children+P+My grandsons and I sat down to watch it and they were meznerized the entire time. Fantasy, learning, fun.+dvd
Solid Stewart western+P+The collaboration of director Anthony Mann and the righteous Jimmy Stewart again provided the ingredients for a successful movie.  Filmed against the sprawling picturesque terrain of New Mexico, the movie tells the tale of Will Lockhart, a loner and  ex-Army man who is now delivering freight via wagon train.  He winds up in the town of Coronado on the border of Apache territory, in part looking for the party responsible for the death of his younger brother.  He was killed in an Apache massacre with rifles illegally supplied to them by an unknown arms dealer.  The town is under control of Alec Waggoman, a cattle baron played by Donald Crisp.  Stewart soon runs afoul of Crisp's ill tempered son Dave played by Alex Nichol coming into conflict with the family who own the huge Barb ranch.  Ranch foreman and filial figure to Crisp, Arthur Kennedy playing Vic Hansbro, is also the guardian of Nichol, keeping him out of harms way.  Stewart manages to upset the Waggoman family dynamic as he pursues the answers to his brothers death as well as trying to keep the Apaches at bay.  With help from two local women the elderly Aline MacMahon playing tough rancher Kate Canady and Cathy O'Donnell playing Crisp's niece Barbara, Stewart eventually gains the trust of Crisp+dvd
Well made, well acted.+N+But why glorify such subject matter? The Academy holds this movie up as a high-point of artistic achievement. Getting to know the workings of a psychotic mind can enrich you life, apparently+dvd
Boy, was this awful!+N+This is a bad movie. A very bad movie. There are no words in which I can express how horrible that movie is+dvd
Phewww....Awful!+N+I see that Freeman & Hackman are executive producers on this stinker. Just reaffirms, I guess, that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves. The truth in spades in this case.   I think, as I'm sure millions do, that Freeman & Hackman are the very best around, but I've never seen them work with such stiff, stilted pathetically sensationalistic material. On top of which Hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like Ben Kingsley.  Why oh why didn't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to Kenneth Branagh to direct them in a dream version of Othello+dvd
Not Really "As Time Goes By" - Beware as this is dated+N+I purchased this and was not happy.  This show was most certainly influential for the better and latter show, but by no means has the depth and excellent dialogue of "As Time Goes By"+dvd
Loved the series!+P+Judi Dench is so great at this type of comedy. I would have loved to have seen her in something of Neil Simons. Her gift for repartee is impressive. As a long time watcher of "As Time goes By" I was delighted to find this series. Rather bittersweet that it was made with her husband, who she lost after a long and I gather successful marriage+dvd
